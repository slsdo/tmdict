  <p>For this last update of the year, we are introducing some major changes to <a href="https://chaldea.tmdict.com/">CHALDEAの記録</a>: from now on CHALDEAの記録 will no longer carry contents that come directly from the FGO game, this includes some servant in-game profiles, as well as all CE data (these contents are widely available on many sites and wiki, we recommend checking out <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/">Atlas Academy DB</a>).</p>

  <p>The old Servant section is repurposed into a more generic <a href="https://chaldea.tmdict.com/profile/">Character Profile section</a>, which will focus on profile translations found in material books from the wider Type-Moon universe. We’ve also added <a href="https://chaldea.tmdict.com/glossary/">all glossary data to the site</a>, presented in a more modern and (hopefully) user-friendly interface, think of it as what a modern version of TMdict could look like!</p>
  
  <p>These changes allow us to focus on more important contents that we find interesting (as opposed to spending time parsing through thousands of CE game files, which can be quite tedious).</p>

  <p>Finally, we’ve also updated the site backend, and onboarded a new search engine that supports fuzzy search. Let us know if you find any issues!</p>

    <li>Changed Servant section in CHALDEAの記録 to Character Profile.</li>
