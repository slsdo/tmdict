  <h5>2022-12-11</h5>

  <p>For this last update of the year, we are introducing some major changes to <a href="https://chaldea.tmdict.com/">CHALDEAの記録</a>: from now on CHALDEAの記録 will no longer carry contents that come directly from the FGO game, this includes some servant in-game profiles, as well as all CE data (these contents are widely available on many sites and wiki, we recommend checking out <a href="https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/">Atlas Academy DB</a>).</p>

  <p>The old Servant section is repurposed into a more generic <a href="https://chaldea.tmdict.com/profile/">Character Profile section</a>, which will focus on profile translations found in material books from the wider Type-Moon universe. We’ve also added <a href="https://chaldea.tmdict.com/glossary/">all glossary data to the site</a>, presented in a more modern and (hopefully) user-friendly interface, think of it as what a modern version of TMdict could look like!</p>
  
  <p>These changes allow us to focus on more important and interesting contents (as opposed to spending time parsing through thousands of CE game files, which can be quite tedious).</p>

  <p>Finally, we’ve also updated the site’s backend, and onboarded a new search engine that supports fuzzy search. Let us know if you find any issues!</p>
