A cafe-styled variety talk show featuring Sendai Eri, who voices Chikagi, and Honda Yoko, who voices Hibiki. The proposal originally set the title as “MAGI BOX” but I begged them in tears and they changed it. It’s on Animate TV twice a month, with new episodes coming out on Mondays, please keep an eye out for it!
