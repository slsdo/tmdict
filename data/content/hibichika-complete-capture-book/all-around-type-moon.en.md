A hodge-podge comedic manga drawn by Japan’s number one thigh artist, B-Suke. It appears in every issue of TYPE-MOON ACE, and has a four-panel version series on the mobile website. Many people may not have known of the HibiChika pair’s existence until they read *HibiChika’s Everyday Trials & Tribulations* in the manga. Thighs are the best.
