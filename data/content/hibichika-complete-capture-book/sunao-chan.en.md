HibiChika’s classmate. She came up with a plan, which she shared with Hibiki, to bring Chikagi to the beach by convincing her that “everyone goes to the beach in the summer.” Most unfortunately, her plans were dashed because she was stuck taking supplementary lessons over the summer break. She has some rather pointlessly fantastic stories such as how after arriving late to school, she tried to climb the wall and come in through the window, or how she is so fond of Tabasco sauce that she is always carrying around a bottle and even once painted the entire content of her lunch box red in Tabasco. Chikagi tries to hide that she is working part-time at Ahnenerbe due to her desire to let anyone but this person know.
