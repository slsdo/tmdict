The Lancer Servant in the Fifth Holy Grail War. He works as a waiter at Ahnenerbe, mainly the opening shift through lunch and on weekends. It seems that many ladies come in for lunch with him in mind. He gets off when HibiChika make it to the shop after school, after which he heads to another part-time gig or goes fishing for his dinner. Geh. We have to do something soon about those people from the church.
