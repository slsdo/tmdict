A lowly creature belonging to the feline family catformia catidae catelis. It shoots beams out of its eyes and can fly with booster jets, although upon writing this I start to doubt if it is really a living thing. Also our first nendoroid figure, which have been all the rage recently. At one point, memory loss spurred her stunningly turning into Neco-Arc, upon which she surprisingly successfully forms a friendship with Lancer. By the way, cats apparently forget a favor after three days.
