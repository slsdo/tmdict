As far as Type-Moon is concered, Nakata Jouji is a living Heroic Spirit. We bumped into each other when recording something else, but right when we were about to thank him, he cheerily thanked us for using him on our mobile site. That was a year ago. The next time we meet I think I will need to prostrating myself at his feet.
