April 2010. Appears to commemorate one year of plain clothes. Chikagi dons a black cardigan and culottes, while Hibiki sports shorts and a tunic. I think that’s about all that needs to be said on this topic… We received some feedback that Chikagi’s clothes are pretty bland, but you need to remember that she is the type of girl who still wears her middle school gym clothes when lounging around home, so you can’t expect anything fancy.
