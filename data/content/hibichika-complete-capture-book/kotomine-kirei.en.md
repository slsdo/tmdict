Everyone’s favorite Father Kotomine. Magus and church executor. Also an expert in mapo and Super Bajiquan. I thought of making an arc in which he perfects a mapo curry dish, eats it with Ciel, resulting in their reconciliation, but when I thought more about it, there’s no way that curry lovers could ever get along with mapo curry lovers.
