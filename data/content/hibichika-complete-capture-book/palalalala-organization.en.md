This is an organization of people who aim to fuse two conflicting ideas, the teachings of God and magecraft. Although it is small, it is a research institute. Once destroyed by the Holy Church, which saw them as a danger, a few researchers are said to have escaped the Church’s clutches and gone into hiding underground. Palalalala members believe that a symbol of a “miracle” once created by the magus they worship exists somewhere in the world, and even now they are working to obtain it. So rumor says.
