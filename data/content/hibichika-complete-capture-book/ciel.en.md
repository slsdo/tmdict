Everyone’s favorite Ciel-senpai. Seventh rank executor of the Burial Agency. There’s a sad backstory about how she wasn’t included in that Melty Blood Drama CD some time ago, so we decided to have her show up at Ahnenerbe. Many people were upset when Kinoko Nasu reported that unfortunately Ciel wouldn’t be attacking you in a special event occurring when buying all the curry bread in Fate/Extra.
