A quasi-heroine of *Fate*, who was supposed to be a mysterious girl commanding the strongest servant Berserker… but now suddenly she turns up as lolita character in bloomers. Makes you feel that the creators’ love for her is scary. Sometimes she forgets to bring her wallet and isn’t allowed to leave the shop, others she is busy rebuilding her relationship with her teacher.
