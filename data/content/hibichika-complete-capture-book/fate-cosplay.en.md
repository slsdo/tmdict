Used to commemorate the release of the film version of *Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works* in January 2010. Chikagi cosplays as Rin, and Hibiki as Archer, so the mobile site was very red for a number of days. Chikagi was nervous about wearing those tights, how typical of a junior high school boy…… but it wouldn’t be proper to say anything more. I think tights are pretty erotic.
