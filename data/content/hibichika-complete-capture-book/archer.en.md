Archer-class Servant summoned by Tohsaka Rin in the Fifth Holy Grail War. Conceited realist with a taste for sarcasm. An offhand remark about how it would be interesting if Archer was found in the red cellphone is what led to us creating the drama CD. Takeuchi Takeshi was the first one to make the suggestion.
