Ahnenerbe’s store manager who first appeared in the Drama CD. We get told a lot that his design relies too heavily on voice actor Nakata Jouji, so we don’t really know what to do with the character now. The store manager in B’ Suke’s manga [*All Around Type Moon*] seems to be getting increasingly similar to Nakata Jouji as well, which complicates things even further.
