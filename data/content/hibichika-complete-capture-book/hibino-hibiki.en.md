A 16-year-old freshman in high school. Works part-time at Ahnenerbe. Her cheerful and energetic way of treating everyone makes her popular amongst men and women of all ages. She is a frontliner for the shop. She has a friendly puppy-like personality, and studies have shown that simply having her around will soften the atmosphere of people in the room. She has the makings of a troublemaker, with occasional outlandish behavior, but she is completely unaware of it. While she is a good cook and takes charge of the kitchen at the shop, she is also fatally bad at cleaning up afterwards, and the kitchen is rumored to be rather hellish by the time the restaurant closes.
She brings out a slightly different side in people, revealing what is typically unseen by others. She seems to act in a way so that people don’t realize. She seems to be keeping something a secret. But at this point this probably doesn’t really matter. Chikagi has never been to Hibiki’s house, which is the subject of many mysterious circumstances. Apparently she lives in a rundown Western-style house with her grandfather, who went on a trip and hasn’t come back. Hibiki lives alone and is not very good at cleaning up, so even if the interior of the house becomes a rotten mess it would not be that surprising, according to a friend who knows what’s going on inside.
