{{n1}}
Three buildings, each with a singularity, are said to have been built by a certain Magician in different locations around the world. Huge, advanced magic circles stretche all the way down to the underground level, it is said that to pass this location one must dash past various troublesome mechanisms in first-person view. Even dimensions used to replace its surroundings have become a mess, creating many problems. That old man really isn’t good for anything!
