{{n1}}
Updated conjunction with the reveal of new Mahou Tsukai no Yoru information in September 2009. Chikagi cosplays as Alice, and Hibiki as Aoko. I received a large number of fan mail praising Chikagi for taking on the challenge of wearing the Reienjo Academy uniform, which clearly shows her body line.
