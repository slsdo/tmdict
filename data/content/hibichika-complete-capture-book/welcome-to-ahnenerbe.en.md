An anime short on the DVD that came with TYPE-MOON ACE Vol. 4. It marks the first time for the HibiChika pair (+Mobile Phone-san) to be voiced. Maybe. We finished everything within about a month, from concept idea to delivery. If we tried again we probably wouldnâ€™t be able to make it. Of course, this project was brought up by Takeuchi Takeshi.
