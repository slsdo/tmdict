Uniform for Ahnenerbe’s staff. Although the male employees wear a garçon-style setup, the female uniform is a blouse paired with a skirt that ends above the knee. The uniform is short sleeved even in winter, and is HibiChika’s main attire. By the way, it was returned after the cosplay fair, and even included a letter saying “it was quite refreshing.”
