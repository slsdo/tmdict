An item on the menu at Ahnenerbe. Slow-cooked pork curry, not the microwave stuff. Normally, it is let sit for a day after cooking, but lately the shop has not been able to keep up with the volume of orders, and people have been asking if the cook is losing their touch. The store manager secretly laments these remarks.
