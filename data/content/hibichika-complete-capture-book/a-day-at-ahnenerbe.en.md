Official drama CD sold at Comic Market 72. This marked the start of a lot of things getting completely broken“ err… rethought and remade. Of course, the box characters don’t make an appearance because of the timing of the release, but they were just having a day off, and Mobile Phone-san was hiding because there were people hanging around that he didn’t want to see! (What the heck.)
