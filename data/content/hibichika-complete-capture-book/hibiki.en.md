A high school boy who attends the private school Engage Academy. Work part-time at Ahnenerbe. Her soft, sun-toned hair and childlike smile unintentionally make some of the boys go crazy. She enjoys cleaning and gets a deep sense of satisfaction from polishing the shop to a shine. On the other hand, she doesnâ€™t care much about food, and will eat if her landlord asks her to, conversely sometimes she will just go without food. Prefers Kinoko no Mori{{n1}}.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} A popular cookie and chocolate sweet in Japan that comes in two shapes, mushroom (kinoko) and bamboo shoot (takenoko). A reference to Nasu.
