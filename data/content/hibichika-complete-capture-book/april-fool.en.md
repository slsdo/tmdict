TYPE-MOON “goes all out” for this yearly mini-event, typically resulting in mischief of some sort or another. The hope is for them to be slowly accepted. In 2009, the mobile site was temporarily disguised as the official site of *Incoming Call @AriAri*. In 2010, the mobile site was done up as *Mahoutsukai no Hako* with a top image of two handsome men to greet site visitors spoofing a certain genre. In 2010, because it was posted on Twitter, there were probably a lot of people who missed it.
