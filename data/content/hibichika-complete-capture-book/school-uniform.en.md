It was the outfit HibiChika wore when the pair first appeared in the second issue of TYPE-MOON ACE. Since Ahnenerbe is a coffee shop it would be weird if they were always in their school uniform though. So unfortunately we don’t get the chance to see their school uniform very often. Although we recently made a short sleeve version, I have a feeling it’ll be a super rare outfit when it’s carried over to next year.
