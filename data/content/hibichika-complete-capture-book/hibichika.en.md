Hibiki’s and Chikagi’s names combine to make HibiChika! Named by Capcom’s “projection master” Higurashi Ryuji. We sometimes receive questions via the form on the mobile site asking if the pairing is Hibi x Chika or Chika x Hibi, but all I can say is that one is clueless and naive and the other is terrible at taking initiative.
