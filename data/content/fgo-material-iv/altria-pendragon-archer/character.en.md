### Personality

The same Artoria as always. However, her attention is just a little bit more relaxed since this is the beach. Her committee chairperson temperament has not changed, but she shows a gentler smile than usual. Thus, she should have a good time during playtime. When it consists of beach games, she will appear with an expression that shows that she hates to lose, playing in order to obtain victory.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

“For this rare vacation, it is probably fine to cut loose at least this time around” – such is her stance. Even while saying such, Artoria is as serious as ever. She is delighted even though she feels embarrassed when someone praises her swimsuit. Apart from that, Artoria cannot swim because of the Protection of the Fairy that causes her to “walk on water”. During her lifetime, she did not need to swim, so she did not really need to practice swimming. In other words, she cannot swim————

### Dialogue Examples

“Play in moderation. Understand?”
“As I am now, I am neither a knight nor a king, but a shooter who fights as your representative. No matter what kind of stage, I shall take the position of number one!”
“Swimminggg! Splendid, too splendid! Mast, die a noble death; Excalibur… Viviannnnn!”
“What I dislike… Something like an Assassin Roller that stealthily comes up behind your back, or a Caster Sniper that aims and shoots at you from far away, but hey… I think what makes sports fun is competing in EARNEST while face-to-face!”

### Role within the Game

A great king of the beach who descended onto the summer sea. Who said King Arthur is only a Heroic Spirit of the Sword? Using a sword. As well as a lance. And even a bow. She also mounts reindeer and assassinates the same kind of Saber she is too. Because of that, is it not possible to say that with these all-purpose battle techniques, she does not feel ashamed of her title, the Knight King?

Since all her duties as a king were left behind at the office at this time, Artoria is dealing with the summer sunlight with all her energy. As she is not able to fully enjoy swimming because of her existing circumstances, Artoria was enjoying herself with watermelon splitting at the beach when she then encountered the Water Blitz (a survival game that uses water guns), and her appearance turned out like this before anyone noticed. It goes without saying that she, who hates to lose, is aiming at becoming a world champion.

————On that day, she came across her (relatively trivial) destiny.

### Connections with Characters

#### Gilles de Rais

“Sea Demons? Ahh, hey, it was those sort of small fry enemies. Before, I competed in killing as many of them as I could and fell behind, but now, they are no longer a threat to me. Octopuses are not something to cut, but something to shoot at. After that, let us both deep-fry them so that they are tasty to eat!”

#### Knights of the Round Table

“Listen, I am about to make a purchase for souvenirs for the Round Table Knights too… How about everyone gets something like matching aloha shirts? It seems like I can picture them wearing them while being delighted.”

#### Swimsuit Artoria Alter

“As I would expect of Great Britain, its maid culture is something to boast about. Its three most important requisites are for one to sweep right on point, to slice right on point, and to shoot right on point… Even so, are you not slightly overdoing this?”
