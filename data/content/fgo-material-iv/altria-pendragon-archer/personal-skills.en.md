### Summer Splash!: A+

Magical Energy Burst (Water).
Her Magical Energy Burst’s attribute is being altered because of Vivian. Although its firepower has surely decreased, its duration capacity has increased. Also, it can even increase the entire party’s defensive power. It is practically a water barrier.

### Protection of the Beach Huts: EX

A personal Skill that restores HP in compensation for NP. While at the beach, she is revered by most food stalls as the “Great King of Foods”. It is probably because of her lavish food orders, the scene of her having her meals being a pleasant feeling, and the shining smile she makes after eating everything on her plate that causes those establishments to prosper, or so it has been told. Is it really? Perhaps it is. However, only mashed potatoes are a “no thank you.”

### Beach Flower: B

A summer Charisma. But at the beach, it is one step behind the other Servants and the destructive power of their bodies. This fact is not even a nice thing to talk about, but Artoria herself does not particularly care.
