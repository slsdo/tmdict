### Magical Resistance: A

No matter what kind of Great Magecraft it is, spells that are at the ranks of A and below will be nullified.
Even if she changes into a swimsuit, powerful Mystics will not harm her. She is a fastidious person alright.

### Independent Action: A

Artoria, who acquired the Independent Action Skill that the Archer Class possesses, displays a very active participation in many fields at the time of the Water Blitz. Sometimes boldly raiding the enemy headquarters, sometimes meticulously lying in wait to ambush the enemy forces, and sometimes relentlessly aiming and shooting at the backs of enemies from a hiding spot. According to an assassin (with a Calico equipment), who is wearing a red hood, those mobilizations got him, who is skilled in field operations to a degree, to say, “So by some chance that is the case, is her true nature identical to mine then?”

### Territory Creation: A

Primarily a Skill from the Caster Class. It is also Magical Energy Burst (Water). A dream-like effect due to the protection of Fairy Princess Vivian, which highly boosts the morale of comrades, raises Luck, raises accuracy rate as well, even gets rid of irritation, and as a bonus, refreshes her and her comrades. A cheat Skill in survival games. By exhibiting this Skill, Artoria will become the champion of the Water Blitz World Tournament, but that is for another story.
