In the middle of creating the swimsuit event, which should even be said to be a large gathering of the popular characters, if we did not completely develop the characters’ special features properly, then we would be drawing the designs and pictures while feeling an immense pressure on us.

For her second stage, I was worried about whether or not I should have her wear the competition swimsuit I drew before in a magazine around the time of Fate/Zero, but in any event, it resulted in this swimsuit, and it even seems to be better for her appearance in matching with the water gun she has. She has traces of her Zero hairstyle on how her hair is tied.

I thought of the flood of emotions I had put into the drawings of her standing pose where her appearance shows her back, and the result of the colouring’s finishing touches happened to be too magnificent as well, so I felt that I had delivered to many of the users with these drawings.
