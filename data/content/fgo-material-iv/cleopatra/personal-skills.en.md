### Imperial Privilege: A

Skills that essentially cannot be possessed by oneself can be acquired for a short time.
By freely using this Skill, Cleopatra can conduct close combat accordingly even with someone attacking her with a spear from right in front of her while being an Assassin. (Because she is primarily compensating for her weak combat abilities by using this Skill, the overwhelming ability brought forth from essentially owning the Imperial Privilege Skill is not able to be exhibited.)

### Golden Rule (Wealth & Body): A{{n1}}

First, it demonstrates the fortune of how much money flowed around her in her life. Her manner of living with gilded splendour is sufficient for her to be a millionaire. The fact that she managed a wealthy dynasty while constantly being requested for aid from many kings and the influential people of Rome has granted her this Skill. Second, it shows her owning a natural and perfect goddess-like body. It is a unique Skill that combines two kinds of “Golden Rule”.

### Divine Protection of the Goddess: C

A Skill that demonstrates the divine protection of the Goddess Isis.
