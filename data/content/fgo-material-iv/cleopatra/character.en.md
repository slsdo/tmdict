### Personality

Domineering – Extremely S – Kind

Cleopatra’s words, deeds, and behaviour are altogether unprecedented for a queen. Dashingly, a top lady who lives on coolness. With her utmost nice nature, there are also traits from her that are seen as foolish because of her speeches and conducts further exaggerating that nature. Acknowledging nothing but heavenly beauty. With the exception of that, everything else is to be disparaged. Nevertheless, she does things such as showing consideration, advising, looking after, and holding receptions for companions on their health and prospects. She loves receptions. She holds self-confidence in her own beauty, and declares loudly that almost all things are “beneath me”, but she is also a hard worker who devotes her present self to her studies day after day just under the point of it being tiresome. Although she usually abuses others, it is not “to act as a fool to others.” It is obvious that she is beautiful. It is obvious that except for herself, the others are not beautiful. That being the case, Cleopatra herself simply talks about what seems to be obvious to be an obvious reality, and in her words, she does not express “unpleasant feelings to the others.”

In a public place, Cleopatra behaves arrogantly as a queen, but when it is the private Cleopatra, that unprecedented style becomes reserved, well-bred and often prudent, and she becomes a cool high-class lady. To say it in a few words, her attributes are domineering, extremely S, and kind. She is kind, despite having sadistic tastes. And although she has sadistic tastes and is very sadistic, it is not because she gets a pleasant feeling in tormenting another person. She does not disparage others for the sake of making herself feel good, but her disposition is merely like that.

Cleopatra’s true nature is of a person of character who tries to discern decorum, pay attention to the surroundings, and keep the peace. Even when the delegations of foreign countries came around, the usual state of things is that she does things such as abusing them first before showing consideration for their health, such as with “In my country, I myself am the absolute standard, and those unattractive are no different than slaves, no matter who they are. Hah, you ugly men of an inferior and low quality, prepare yourselves! Do continue to relax to your hearts’ content here!”, thanking the delegations afterwards with a hospitality of the highest quality.

Cleopatra has a bad habit of catching every hardship given that she thinks about trying to do everything perfectly as well, her perfectionist temperament being a misfortune. “… Troublesome…” She speaks to herself.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Cleopatra comes into contact with her Master with a condescending attitude in a straightforward manner. However, her “attentive attribute” that is the basis of her is fully displayed, vigorously paying attention to the ways of how to take care of her Master.

The wish Cleopatra wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to acknowledge Caesar and their son Caesarion.” Towards the world far and wide, she wants to vigorously announce that her child Caesarion is a child spun from the result of the love between the couple————

### Dialogue Examples

“Troublesome…”
“Do look up at me reverently!”
“My fingers got dirty. But if it was the case of crushing something with them, at best, a fruit would have been fine with me.”
“Words to represent master and servant? Guess what I have decided? Gods and humans! Humans work for the gods, and gods cannot shine without humans. In other words, it means that you are my most valuable possession!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A tragic queen who left her beauty in history. A figure of 1st Century BC. The last queen of Egypt’s Ptolemaic Dynasty, and essentially known as the Last Pharaoh of ancient Egypt. Cleopatra called herself the incarnation of the Goddess Isis and excelled in many groundings, having spent her whole life to protect Egypt’s Ptolemaic Dynasty to the end, but… she was not able to oppose the raging era whirling in the Mediterranean world, and in the end, she gave up her own life; thus, the dynasty reached its demise.

Although Cleopatra has a certain image of reigning over Egypt according to her beauty, it is in fact the exact opposite. She was deeply intelligent, manipulated multiple languages, and regarding especially her economic skills, it was by far absurd. It was said that she raised Egypt’s Ptolemaic Dynasty, a country inferior in military strength, to a world-leading economic state according to her directions.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The great Top Lady Pharaoh. Being self-conscious of her charm, Cleopatra turned it into her greatest weapon to seduce others, and on the topic of becoming intimate with a seduced partner, it would be nice if he was a lovely man. The word “lovely” here is not necessarily about his appearance, but what is inside of him that is important. If one cuddles close together with another, then it is good to devote their life. Marriage is something neat. To ascertain love peacefully, birth children, and wish for proper acknowledgement. One among the two people who consecrated their greatest love to her in her lifetime, the general Caesar of the Roman Empire, was even charmed by her ambitions and intellect that were so far as fierce, but Caesar was a fine figure of a man, or something like that, to the extent that Cleopatra herself thought “I lost…!”

Cleopatra got close to two men in her lifetime. First, Caesar. Towards him, she clearly fell in love. The state of their passions and affections made even the wind fluttering in the Mediterranean Sea appear to be sparkling, but… he died. Although the unification of the Mediterranean world was right before his very eyes, he was assassinated. He left their son Caesarion. And then, there was a person who appeared before Cleopatra while she was lost in tears. The man who told her that he will protect Cleopatra and Egypt’s Ptolemaic Dynasty, the general Antonius of Rome. Her country and people, and two men————the lovely Caesar and Antonius of Rome; in the end, she committed suicide.

She got close to two men, and died.

It was love. It was the result of her feelings. Was it also something like a product of her self-interest?————However, posterity, not to mention even in those days, unanimously whispered that “this devilish woman seduced the Roman generals”, and as a result, becoming a Heroic Spirit and subsequently materializing as a Servant nowadays, Cleopatra acquired an existence as “a woman of seduction endowed with a devilish beauty.” Even so, as per her dignity————she only gets close to lovely gentlemen. A person endowed with sincerity inside and who believes in having no regrets even if they died together, only this kind of partner similar to the men she loved before can, utterly, seduce her.

In “Fate/Grand Order”, Cleopatra appears in modern garments such as in leather shorts and a jacket, but this is the expression of her maiden power of “simply not displaying her true self with such an appearance.” When the time comes where she trusts her Master and their bonds have been deepened, she will probably display “her appearance in accordance with historical fact” for the first time.

During moments of combat, Cleopatra will soon be in high spirits. To the extent that she will be ridiculing loudly during those moments. She also had a wild temperament while alive, and she had even taken lessons in swordsmanship and hand-to-hand fighting techniques in jest, but now that she has transformed into a Servant, she attained and displays genuine hand-to-hand fighting techniques because of her Imperial Privilege Skill. Although she is an Assassin that mainly tries to do surprise attacks as per typical of the Class, if it is a Saber or Lancer opponent of average ability, it becomes possible for her to endure and even exchange blows with those opponents from right in front of her.

Cleopatra loves Alexandria, the capital where she was born and raised in, and she deeply respects and adores the great king Iskandar of Macedonia who in addition, became the origin of the name Alexandria and the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

Cleopatra herself really gets angry and becomes depressed when she is called a “beautiful courtesan” given that was not her intention. For Cleopatra herself, she has only devoted herself to love, similar to getting fired up, in regards to men who, upon giving their word, protected her and her country while simultaneously endeavouring for the sake of defending her beloved native land of Egypt and the city of Alexander; with that purpose, in no way was she a courtesan and the like.

### Others

Strictly speaking, the “Last Pharaoh” is proven to be Cleopatra’s own child, Caesarion, who Cleopatra had chosen as a joint ruler in her last several years. This is because after Cleopatra’s death, Caesarion lived longer for at least a few days. However, Caesarion was only 9 years old{{n1}} during the time he lost his life. Thus, the de facto “Last Pharaoh” who ruled over the country and fought against fate was surely Cleopatra.
