Summons an enormous monster, a serpent with a striped pattern of gold and blue. The serpent is coiled around with flames over its whole body. Because she does not own a Riding Skill, Cleopatra is unable to manipulate it. Consequently, the serpent can absolutely do nothing but destroy the surroundings (Cleopatra also receives damage from this). If one owns the Divinity Skill, damage received is reduced in proportion to their Skill’s rank.

Cleopatra calls this serpent a “Divine Beast”, but it is strictly not a Divine Beast of the Phantasmal Kind, and it is something that embodied the concept of ancient Egypt’s demise. Her regret and anguish during her lifetime where she had no other choice but to choose the option of shutting down the history of Egypt that spanned over thousands of years by severing her own life was changed into a Noble Phantasm connected with the serpent (Uraeus) that symbolizes the Divinity of the Pharaohs. The symbolic serpent is the cobra, and was it by coincidence, was it by intention, or was it according to a predetermined destiny that it was the cobra that Cleopatra had chose as her means of suicide?
