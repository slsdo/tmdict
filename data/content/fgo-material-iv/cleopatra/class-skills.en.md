### Presence Concealment: B

A Skill to erase one’s presence. When activated, the user becomes almost impossible to be perceived, even for a Servant. However, during the moment of attack, the effect will be diminished drastically.

### Divinity: D

A Skill where one has Divine Spirit aptitude.
The Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty have a thin connection with the gods in comparison to the legendary Pharaohs like King Ozymandias of before, so they are not endowed with the Divinity Skill. However, Cleopatra is regarded as the “incarnation of the Goddess Isis” because of her exceptional beauty, so she acquires the Divinity Skill.
