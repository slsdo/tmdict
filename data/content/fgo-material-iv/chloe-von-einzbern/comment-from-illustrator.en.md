Being a welfare character, she only has 1 clothing set and it’s decided to be her usual piece without any debate. Were she to have 3 stages appearance instead, she would have a bikini armor with armor parts jutting here and there on it. Too bad, so sad. Since, the same with Illya, her design is from the old days, even I am kinda forgetful about it, but the foundation is Emiya’s arrangement. Her dark skin is also Emiya’s influence. Her breastplate is cut in the image of heart shape. (Hiroyama Hiroshi)
