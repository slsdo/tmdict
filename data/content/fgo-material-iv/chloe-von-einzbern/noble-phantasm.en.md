Kakuyoku Sanren.
In the 3rd volume of the original works Zwei! it was a sword technique with Kuro’s all might that she attempted when she challenged Bazett.
A simultaneous projection of 3 sets of the yin-yang sword “Kanshou & Bakuya”. Two of those is then thrown to the enemy in a surrounding manner, and the leftover set is used by hands as she herself leaps and dashes a sword attack. The so called “six blade style” inescapable sword technique.
