### Personality

Ever known as the “child of sorrow”, being a downer is a normal condition for him. A narcissist slightly intoxicated with himself. However, since his circumstances are genuinely tragic, it’s hard to call him out on it.{{n1}}
The type that perceives things tragically, and ends up thinking that every mistake is his fault.
His thoughts are calm, his tactics precise; yet where it concerns women his reason are shaken, in a good way. (For example, if his Master is female and someone had taken her hostage, presumably even if it is a trap he would still go and walk in anyway).
A member of the Knights of the Round Table. Perhaps it was due to his days of wandering (to put it more accurately, it was due to him being included from other legends to the legend of King Arthur), but his loyalty to the king is not absolute, or better put, less fanatic.
However, he felt deep shame from leaving his service under the king, and it was during his following service where he set his mind to be completely faithful.

He is severe and without mercy against his enemies, but there is a side of him that would grieve for the enemies and shed tears for them once the battle is over.

Is it not a sinful of him, born without blessing, to kill those born with one? …is what he kept on thinking.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Fundamentally, he simply serves as a knight. In the case where the Master is female, he will courteously treat her as a princess; while if the Master is a male, then he will dedicate his sword for him as a king.
Perhaps this is due to the massive love affair he experienced when he was alive; the possibility that he would fall for someone is low. However, due to his beautiful countenance, it’s possible for others to fall for him instead. The so-called “Diarmuid”-type Servant, but rather there’s just simply no chance to consequently make use of this nature of his.
Should the Master raises their trust for him, he would put to stake even his life to protect the them.

However, should the Master is a wicked one instead, be they men or women, there shall be no mercy from Tristan.

### Dialogue Examples

“Of the Round Table serving under King Arthur, Tristan of Lament. I have come in response of your summon. I pray that this body of mine may be of use to you. By your order, Master.”
“-----Ahh, how sorrowful. For this self, born within sorrow, to once again let a child who would have been raised and engulfed with joy die.”
“Master. Please. Pay no mind to me, and simply keep on pushing through your path. This Tristan is but your attendant, one who would prune the wicked ones standing in your way.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Tristan is a child born from Rivalen, the King of Leonois, and Blancheflor, the younger sister of Mark, sovereign of Cornwall. However, this circumstances made it fitting to call him “child of sorrow”.
To begin with, Tristan’s father Rivalen had died in battle without ever seeing Tristan’s face. Her mother Blancheflor died soon after she gave birth to him, right after she gave her the name Tristan and entrusted him to Rivalen’s loyal subordinate Loire.
Afterwards, Tristan ended up serving under his uncle, King Mark, as a knight.
He served him well; King Mark too, ended up putting deep trust in this handsome knight.

However, one day Tristan fell in love with a woman known as Isolde.
It was a love made to be by means of aphrosidiac; yet nevertheless, it was the first love Tristan the child of sorrow ever experienced, one worthy for him to devote his live for.

Perhaps the tragedy lays in the fact that Isolde is the woman King Mark loved and had been sworn to marry. Due to the admonition of King Mark’s courtier, those who were envious of Tristan, he was inevitably forced to leave the royal court.

Afterwards, Tristan served under King Arthur as a Knight of the Round Table, performing numerous deeds and feats. There, he had friends; he had a king worthy for him to serve.
Yet there was nobody he could love there; Tristan had been warned that the burning love inside him was due to the fault of the aphrosidiac, but he fully understood that such a drug had already long past its effectiveness.

Many times they passed each other, and he still continued on being torn up over an insensitive one.
It would have been so much easier were his uncle King Mark is an evil man.
However. King Mark had loved Tristan ever since the times where he had served under him as a knight. To Tristan, whose countenance hold the vestiges of his sister.
There is no way Tristan would betray him. He then simply go through despair, day every day.

Before long, Tristan had been brought down by a poison as he was fighting; as he lay there dying, he wished to once more be able to meet Isolde. Knowing of his predicament, Isolde too left behind her position under King Mark as his wive.

“Should she come, then a white sail. Should she not, then a black sail-----”
Then the other Isolde, Isolde the White Hand, murmured to Tristan as he waited for the ship.
“A boat with black sail is coming this way.”
It was a modest treason (lie), uttered towards the husband who had never tried to love her, even if he had married her.
Tristan accepted those words, so that he could atone for what he had done to her.

He was reunited with Isolde; yet by then it was too late. Isolde, who didn’t make in time, kissed him as her tears falling over. She had not been afraid of touching him, who had been poisoned to death, nor had she been afraid of dying herself.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Tristan had separated himself from the Knights of the Round Table before he had succumbed to poison.
I understand. The king was magnificent.
He was fair, sincere, with no gap where human emotion can crept in.
The very picture of kings of old, showing no emotion even as it is there.

-----Maybe, just maybe. Are the king not mistaken?
-----Nay, maybe it is I who had mistaken the king.

Perhaps it was simply an extravagant worry. Perhaps it was but a speculation.

However, the king had not even a splinter of feelings-----nay, it was that she simply harbored far too many feelings that she killed her self and continued on fighting. The sight of the small, thin king; it was too heartbreaking.
It was tragic exactly because it was right; it was sorrowful exactly because it was right.
Tristan no longer had the will nor the mind to endure such a thing.

The unexpected sharp words that he uttered, at the time where he separated from the Knights of the Round Table.
The words towards the too many knights.
And so, he unknowingly bestowed a “curse” upon even the king.
Indeed, he murmured such as he left.


“The king understands not of human heart.”

Lancelot and Gawain, the equal delegates of the Round Table.
The unconventional Lancelot, the grand Gawain.
And Tristan, the natural airhead, in charge{{n2}}. Of course, Tristan himself is completely unaware of this.
