Failnaught.
The bow of Tristan is lauded as “the bow of true hit”… but as a Noble Phantasm its form is simply that of “threads.” Utilizing the bowstring of his favored harp, he waves about these threads and flicks off the air, firing vacuum arrows.
Due to the uncommon nature of the angle adjustment, the arrows velocity, and above all, the speed by which he loads them, complete evasion is almost impossible, no matter how much a hero excels in speed.
It may be that to be able to oppose it, one must use means such as moving out of range or a form of dimension leap.
He uses this thread in various of ways; binding the opponent, or shredding them to bits.
Furthermore, in an area filled with obstacles like forests and such, it can be used to prepare foot snares type of traps. The moment the enemy steps on the laid vacuum traps, they are raised midair and chopped to bits.
Scary.
