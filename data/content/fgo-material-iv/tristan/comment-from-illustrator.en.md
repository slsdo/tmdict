When I drew Tristan’s rough sketch, I scribbled a line up of the Knights of the Round Table besides the manuscript, and the complete set of these guys really looks great, eh… is what I thought. Then I checked the gathered materials, line up the characters, and put the finishing touches for his last ascension. It was kinda hard to understand from the card drawing, but the glimpse was Lancelot’s armor shoulder pad. The violet thingy in his chest is the wound poison he got when he was alive. There probably was or wasn’t a talk of how it it could be a stuck-on seaweed. (Morii Shizuki)
