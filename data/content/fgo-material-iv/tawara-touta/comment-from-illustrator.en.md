If it’s Tawara Touta, then the famed Taira no Masakado’s subjugation would come to mind. But this time I drew the him as an Archer possessing the bow that he used to exterminate the Oomukade. The image is an invigorating, macho gourmand. Similar to a certain gourmet house Nori somewhere. With his Noble Phantasm of bale that cannot be exhausted in his shoulder, he seems to use it as a battle weapon… is how I think it went with his animation motion. Detailed art of rice soaring and scattering! (Shimokoshi)
