O Great Bodhisattva Hachiman, Your Blessing Upon This Arrow.
Marksmanship by means of five men drawn strong bow that he had favored since early in life.
Includes anti-demonic bonus due to the anecdote where he brought down the Oomukade and the Dodomeki.
In addition, it has been specially given a divine protection of the dragon god dwelling in the lake.
