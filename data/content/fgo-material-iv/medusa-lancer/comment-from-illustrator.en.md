To tell you the truth, her birth is quite a difficult one. She is a Lancer now but in the beginning she was ****{{n1}}, is the cause. Her weapon was designed to be more lance-like, but a large scythe is like, much more cooler! Is the reason of why it’s arranged like that. (As long as you don’t touch stuffs that is obviously no good, there are lots of case where the self modded design got a pass) The staffs at battle sprite production always ended up going through hardship each time, but I have to say I really like the gimmick where they change her hairstyle on ascension. Braid, loosen, ponytail; making those small differences was quite an ordeal, but I’m really glad I drew it in the end. Her sickle and chain action was so greaaaat… It was not really Lancer-like (LOL) but now it reminds me, is swimsuit Kiyohime’s hidden class strengthening not here yet…?{{n2}} (BLACK)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} It’s 4 letters, so judging from the classes katakana maybe she is Assassin initially?
2. {{note2}} Also, here’s what it said in japanese in regards of the self modded design and kiyohime stuffs in case someone wants to double check the meaning: “NGに触れなければ割とお任せデザインが通ること多いです” and “水着清姫被っちゃってるんで強化まだかなあ”.
