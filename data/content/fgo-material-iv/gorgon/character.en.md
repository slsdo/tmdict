### Personality

She was once a goddess, renewed as the existence of a monster that devours humans.
A portion of her body quite resembles that of a human, but even so her disposition is that of e powerful predator, an avenger embodying ferocity.
The vestiges of what once was one of the violet-haired goddess, who had lived in a small isle ever since time immemorial, is but her outward appearance. Her nature is already close to that of the monster Gorgon, who had took in her beloved sisters and had pulverized the many heroes who had dared embarked upon the isle.
She comprehends human speech by means of an exceedingly high intelligence; she does not fall to madness, and it is not that her mind is being contaminated-----yet above it all, essentially a mutual understanding with her is difficult.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

A degree of awareness of being a vessel upon manifestation.{{n1}}

In the unlikely event of success in regards of deepening mutual bond with her, the Master shall receives a great power. However, as expected her standpoint is different from that of a human. One must realize that she is fundamentally a disparate existence.
Her love and affection---
are not meant for human.

### Dialogue Examples

“My favored food, you ask? The suffering of humans. What else do you think it might be? Fool.”
“Annihilation. It is the one and only thing.”
“You are not a sacrifice; you are nothing but a mere prey.”
“Medusa. Quite a nostalgic name…”
“Be. Quiet.”

### Character Image

The third of the three Gorgon Sisters in Greek legend.
Her real name is Medusa.
The result of an accursed growth.
By means of an uncertain factor, her disposition as a monster that is her foundation (original) is remarkably emphasized. She is on the verge of perfect metamorphosis from a goddess into a perfect demonic monster. Normally she cannot be summoned as a Servant.

------Already she is an existence that can only be called as the Queen of Magical Beasts.

She, who ended up embodying an existence exceedingly close to that of the monster Gorgon, is essentially a threat towards mankind. Indeed she was summoned as a Servant by means of Chaldea’s system, but a meticulous caution is needed in handling her. If the Master lose their focus, they will lose their life.

In a way, one can say that she is a sample demonstrating the astounding, state of the art Chaldea summoning formula. Such a mechanism that summons not only possessions and divided spirits (bunrei) of the gods, but even also such a dangerous existence as a Servant; even in the world of magic, one simply cannot call it anything but a rare occurrence.

### General Armaments

Adjacent attacks by means of her hooked claws, a mid ranged attack by means of her hair feelers that had turned into snakes. Long ranged attack by means of an intense magic energy light is also possible.

### Others

Including the non-humanoid, monstrous parts of her body would result in a substantial weight and height value.

……Both that and I, had once seen a transient dream.
No words need to be said.

What a strange feeling.
The more I look at them, the more the feelings that I once had dwells within me. ….As though like that of a human.

#### Stheno / Euryale

Elder sisters, I-----

#### Perseus

(She does not individually recognize him as Perseus who had once fought Gorgon, but she instinctively harbors unpleasant feelings and anger towards him, who holds a portion of her corpse turned into Noble Phantasm.)
