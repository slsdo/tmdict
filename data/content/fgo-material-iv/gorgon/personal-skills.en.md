##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Parts of the description is word by word with the skill Natural Demon. So if you were a monster from beginning, you get Natural Demon. If you were changed to one, you got Mutation Demon. Either way, it’s a steroid on STR and CON. I’m guessing that since this one is Mutation version, its mechanism is a modification of toughness a.k.a. battle continuation on self by means of demonization, and maybe Natural version would be inherently different in mechanism. Maybe. And it’s weird how they said this isn’t applied in FGO when she literally have this in-game.
