Medusa in the state of 50% monster-ization, or something like that kind of feeling. Her character has changed a lot from the initial setting; there were a lot of drawing change, like turning white at her third phase, or her turning into colossal size (perfect monster transformation). The design idea is Fateâ€™s Black Sakura-ish, but seems like the breasts are bigger huh. (Shimokoshi)
