Ramesseum Tentyris.{{n1}}
His greatest trump card, similar to a Reality Marble.

The great temple complex that embodied as a Noble Phantasm the might and authority of Pharaoh Ozymandias.
By mixing the composite body of several temples, such as the Great Temple of Dendera and the Great Temple of Karnak, and combining mausoleum and temples such as the Ramesseum and the Great Temple of Abu Simbel, it is transformed into a heteromorphic, enormous temple complex that does not exist in reality.

For each and every temples, it is possible to arbitrarily grant curses and divine protections associated with the dwelling deities, targeting those who enters his personal domain. It is an anti-fortress Noble Phantasm that utilized magic energy bombardment by means of the “Dendera Light Bulb” as its main method of offense, but in FateGO itcan perform an anti-unit offense by means of a large mass attack as a last resort. A terrifying method of attack that has the enormous Great Temple Complex appears on the sky and crushes down the enemy line by means of large mass. In addition, it has its base strengthened by means of the magic energy brought about by the Dendera light bulb.

Why is it that the likes of Great Temple of Dendera that was not built by him exists within the Great Temple Complex? The reason originates from Ozymandias’ bygone days. As he built a great numbers of enormous temples, he simultaneously stated that “all temples, be they exist in past, present, or future, exists for my sake.” He even performed glorifications and revisement to a large numbers of temples built before his days and made them his own. Even in the current present of 21st century, the one who have his name engraved unto most of the various Egypt monuments is none other than he, Pharaoh Ozymandias (Ramesseum II).

(There is one theory stating that various princes who idolized him had his name be left in history far and wide.)

Abu Hol Sphinx.{{n2}}
The incarnation of the sky god Horus and the manifestation of raging fire and wind that strikes fear upon the people, a beast with the body of a lion and the face of man that was told of in Ancient Egypt legend.
Even in Modern Egypt, its existence was left behind within their language as the Father of Fear (Abu Hol).
During the sixth chapter of part one they made quite a frequent appearance-----but they fundamentally are not utilized in FateGO.
In addition, within the aforementioned Great Temple Complex of Radiance sleeps the leader specimen that ruled over these sphinxes, the sphinx of Wehem Mesut. (In FateGO its figure can be seen during EX attack.)

Mesektet.{{n3}}
Ozymandias, who regards himself as Ra, utilizes this ship the sun god Ra impels as his own possession. It radiates on the surface powerful light of magic energy that embodies the might of the sun god, referred as “the serpent that slays serpent (Uraeus)”. It scorches not only the enemies, but even the surface as a whole.
(In FateGO its true name release is not performed.)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Ramesseum is the name of the mortuary temple of Ramesses II aka Ozy. Tentyris is the latin name for the city of Dendera, where the Great Temple of Dendera resides. My guess is Ozy’s NP name coins this 2 term together simply because it alludes to Ozy making Dendera temple and consequently Dendera light bulb his own.
2. {{note2}} Abu Hol is apparently another name to call a sphinx, and apparently literally translated as Father of Fear/Terror. Wehem Mesut usually refers to a period in ancient Egypt, but apparently can be translated as Repetition of Birth. Alluding to the sphinx children during Valentine?
3. {{note3}} Mesektet is the ship that Ra uses in his journey through Duat, ancient Egyptian version of Underworld each night. Mesektet is the evening boat and Mandjet is the morning boat.
