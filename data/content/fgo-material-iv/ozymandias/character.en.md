### Personality

A pharaoh filled to the brim with unswaying confidence. The Sun King.
It is not arrogance, nor is it haughtiness. He simply conducts himself as a god and a pharaoh that he is as a straightforward fact.
That mentality completely savored the splendour of the world, reigned over Ancient Egypt at the time.
He is the son of the sun god, while at the same time his incarnation, stipulating himself as the one absolute above the earth.
Just like a bird flying above the great skies, just like a fish swimming within the great seas, just like a flower blooming in full glories in the plains, he is naturally a God King (Pharaoh).

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

His attitude towards his master depends on his mood.
Even as he understands his present state as a Servant who cannot continues on materializing without magic energy supply, he will not dangle his head down to the magus to begin with.
He expects not to be treated as a servant. He will take action when and only when his and the Master’s goal coincide.

Facing a man endowed with such a sovereign characteristic, one soften up their manner. A king is never an equal to a pharaoh, yet it is quite well for a pharaoh to watches over and guide the kings who are not pharaoh. Such is what he does as he advances on his own. Possibly, should somebody who (maybe) possesses the similar presence as his former friend exist, he would take interest to them and peer into their face.

However, as a main principle.
His “beloved” is ever only Queen Nefertari, and his “friend” is ever only Moses. That alone, no matter how long time passes, shall never change.

### Dialogue Examples

“My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”
“A pharaoh is absolute. Revere. I shall allow it. It is only befitting for men to bow down before the sun. You may worship me.”
“Nothing is impossible above the earth for a pharaoh! All things within creation is in the palm of my hand!”
“Haha! Indeed, gaze upon the sky! Crawl across the earth! Prostrate yourself! For gazing upon my radiance means vanishing from this age and nothing else!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A figure from 13th~14th century BCE.
A pharaoh of Ancient Egypt who had ruled a vast empire.
He had fought the Hittites, and before long had concluded peace. With that, he brought about a thriving prosperity to Ancient Egypt by means of cultural exchange and interaction. An exemplary statesman.

He is in particular a valorous general, and a man who had married world’s most beautiful women and fathered over a hundred children. Even in the current era he is famous for leaving behind a large numbers of various colossal constructions.

He loved his nation just like Osiris would his, and he was greatly loved in return.
Ozymandias is also known as Ramesseum II and Meryamen.
The very golden age of Ancient Egypt is during his longstanding reign of 7X years.

There are numerous cases of the name Moses, his brother-in-law whom he had grown up together with, being brought up.
According to an existing anecdote, the Egyptian sovereign who prevented the “Exodus” of the Jews with his rule, then utilized a great army to pursue them, is considered to be none other than Ozymandias.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Normally, a pharaoh considers “death” as a transient sleep. As they dream of rebirth at the farthest end of time, naturally it becomes the undertaking of a journey towards to gods. However, Ozymandias could not stand it. It is exactly because if he is truly the one who hold the world in the palm of his hand, that he lamented, even resented his powerlessness. The powerlessness of his body, unable to do anything but accept the transient sleep as the successive generations of pharaohs had done.
“No man in this world grieves as I grieve upon the brink of death.”
His perfect self.
His absolute self.
He curses the truth where one must go to the eternal sleep.
Even if he is promised a rebirth and revival upon the “land of eternity”.

Eventually, he who had engraved himself unto human history manifested as a Servant.
At the time of his first manifestation, he who knew that his remains was being kept at a museum in Cairo has no choice but to stand up in a certain kind of spiritual awakening.
As he had been moved away from the mausoleum, under the mythological outlook of Ancient Egypt no longer would he, as one of the successive lines of pharaohs, be revived in his original body.
And it that do be the case, then he would do as he wish to the utmost.
Anything is fine; be it desiring immortality on top of preserving his perfect body just like in the past, or simply eliminating the insolent Master then vanished away, or perhaps ruling the world and bringing about prosperity upon the people at peace.

And then, now. During his latest manifestation…
Indeed, if the Human Order is upon a crisis, then now is truly the time to save the world. Such is the thought he naturally arrived at.
Once, he did not manage to establish it. But, if it is Chaldea with numerous figure befitting to that of heroes, then perhaps-----

### Others

During his live his greatest height was expected for to reach 180cm in height or more. However, he himself proclaims that the greatest height, the summit of his live, is when his beloved Nefertari gave birth to their second prince.

### Connections with Characters

#### Moses

His brother in law, who he grew up together with, raised by the same mother.
A youth filled with shining talent and trait of a sovereign. There was even a chance of him becoming the pharaoh.
Ozymandias approved of Moses as “befitting to be my brother in law, a saint who are far from ordinary”. And yet, simultaneously ***********************.

#### Karna

Fellow child of the sun.
Indeed. Our combat compatibility is bad.

#### Tamamo no Mae

Fellow incarnation of the sun.
Indeed. As expected I am the older brother here.

#### Quetzalcoatl

Hoh. A sun god of a foreign land, is she? Hohoh.

#### Old Man of the Mountain.

Fu…..

#### Arash / Arthur Pendragon (Prototype)

I do hold interest for Heroic Spirits who are pure and honest in nature. All the more so if they be heroes who had saved the world.

#### Cleopatra / Iskander

THe pharaohs. They cannot be compared to I, the King of Kings. Yet they are pharaohs nonetheless. I suppose it would not be so bad to join Nitocris and the other for a trip around the world.

#### Nitocris

An ancient pharaoh. She went through some troubles upon fighting the Lion King. Supposedly she is one you would call motherly, but I have decided to treat her as my retainer. For that is no less than her own wish.

#### Gilgamesh

Unexpectedly get along.

#### Nefertari

An existence I loved and hold supreme more than even myself.
I once had a numerous amount of wives, but now-----if Nefertari is by my side, I’d keep on thinking that maybe I have no need for the likes of concubine.
