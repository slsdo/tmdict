This here is a sovereign whose first appearance is not on FGO, and had become quite a long time company. But sometimes you can still feel a new breath in his action and his sudden, spontaneous remarks. To tell you the truth, I wonder if I did him a bit plain (実はあれが素だったりするんでしょうかね). Also, feels fatherly. Whats that, so unfair. Also, he has a lower glandular hair, but the one you must recognize first is the deepness and balance of his eyeliner. I will devote myself to draw you better, o king. Guess what is the flower on his last ascension illustration is about. (Nakahara)
