### Subversive Activities: B+

The ability to reduce enemy’s war potential in the preliminary stage before going to battle.
An expert of traps.
With this skill at B rank, it is possible to disable close to 30 percent of the enemy forces before they advance.
In Fuuma Kotarou’s case, the more subordinates he has the more the damage ratio increases.
However, the higher the ranking of this skill is the more one’s spiritual status as a hero declines.

### Ninjutsu: A+++

Intelligence gathering skills, combat techniques, larceny skills, torture techniques, and etc. utilized by ninjas.
At A++, one can be said to be on the class of Iga and Koga’s head.
At A+++, one stands shoulder to shoulder among the legendary ninjas.
The system is unique for each school, and almost no documents related to the Fuuma shinobi clan, brought to ruin by the Tokugawa house, are left behind.
This Heroic Spirit, fifth head of the clan, is thought to be chosen by means of his true strength and competency.

### Paranoia{{n1}}: C

A state that originates from soldiers of a defeated army being frightened simply from the sound of the wind, or the cry of the crane; from fear as the origin itself.
As Fuuma Kotarou suppresses his presence and lays surprise attack, by making use of his subordinates as if they are his own limb he is capable of intentionally reproducing the state of paranoia. The will to fight severely declines, and all kinds of bad status effects are applied as a matter of course.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} In japanese this skill is 風声鶴唳, using kanji for wind, sound, crane, and such; a proverb that means “getting frightened even by a slight noise,” “hearing the enemy in every leaf that rustles,” or “being afraid of one’s own shadow.” So Paranoia technically fits, but it doesnt encapsulate the whole meaning.
