### Personality

A shinobi of the “indoor” faction, docile and honest.
Physically, he had attained the one true destination as a ninja, but he is compassionate to the point that he is unfit to be one.
He will accomplishes his duty precisely as a duty, but normally he prefers tranquility.

However, I’m stopping any compliments to the Iga and Koga said in front of me!

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Fundamentally, he will accept any and every kind of order, even if said order is ambiguous in its nature of good or evil.
To have somebody die, to have somebody be ruined, to have somebody fall as prey, and simultaneously deciding which should be prey; in order to find the clear solution for those, almost anything and everything is permissible.

### Dialogue Examples

“Suppressing the heart with a blade. As they met… tragedy begins.”{{n1}}
“Mayhaps I am not of man. And yet… that too, is fine. That is what I believe now. My gratitude upon you.”
“Silence.
Apathetic I may be, but there are three kinds of people I never forgive;
One, those involved in the trade yet neglecting to care for their weapons.
Two, subordinates who turn away merchant doing home delivery.
And lastly-----
Those who grade us of Fuuma below those of Koga and Iga!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Fuuma Kotarou is, strictly speaking, a name granted to the head of the Fuuma shinobi clan.
However, this is not the case like that of Sasaki Kojirou, where several legends are sublimated and a fictitious swordsman is brought forth; he is, without a doubt, the “fifth” Fuuma Kotarou.
Fuuma Kotarou, employed during the warring states period by the Houjou, daimyo ruling the Kanto region, had helped cementing the Houjou rule with those terrifying techniques of his.
Among the others, the Fifth is a legendary existence, winning fame as a thief even after Tokugawa’s established age.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The Fuuma shinobi clan had, since the time of the First, came up with all sorts of ingenious plans with the purpose to be cast as the greatest of shinobis of all time. Arousing the blood of oni kin, intentionally adopting the blood of foreigners, polishing and refining their art. Even further, by accurately cultivating the technique of the Fuuma in a karakuri kunoichi, they had prevented the degradation of information caused by oral and book instruction.
Their end goal is unknown, but in the course of casting the Fuuma shinobi clan as the greatest of shinobis of all time, several hundreds have lost their live, with the mantle passing on to the next.
Fuuma Kotarou, summoned as a Servant, is the fifth head and simultaneously the heroic figure bearing the lives of those several hundreds.

However, it is nothing short of irony for him to be lacking any sort of desire for the prestige, for the pursuing to be the greatest of shinobis of all time.

He wants the Fuuma to remain; yet even as he hold such a sentiment for some reason he did not pass on the technique of the Fuuma to anybody, instead leaving it hidden under the shadow of history.

### General Armaments

Kunai, kusarigama (sickle and chain)

### Connections with Characters

#### Sasaki Kojirou

Putting the Fuuma after the Koga and Iga… absolutely unforgivable.

#### Sakata Kintoki

The great hero that I revere as my great senior. Golden… Immortal Chaos Golden Brigade…!

#### Jeanne d’Arc Alter Santa Lily

I think I did a bit of bad things to her. I apologize.

#### Katou Danzou

There is a strong bond. A bond beyond that of a mother, a teacher, an elder sister; a bond beyond those and everything else.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The first dialogue is maybe another shinobi pun. kanji for blade and heart when adjoined together becomes kanji for ninja/shinobi. Also, 絶つ can means either sever or suppress. Kotarou did say in Shimousa “A shinobi (忍び) without a heart (心) is nothing more than a blade (刃)” so it alludes to that, but context wise i think he is also saying misfortune and tragedy follows shinobi? Anyway I need help with this, I fear I didnt get the meaning totally right, context wise.
