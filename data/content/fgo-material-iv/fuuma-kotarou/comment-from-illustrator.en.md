With him being a mixed blood oni and all, at first I thought he has a perm that looks similar like the one on oni toys, with the horns growing and stuffs. But this and that happens and he then became a calm and composed ninja with his eyes hidden. After he was implemented I was like, is this ok!? He’s, like, totally cute this way! Too much gap! He ain’t doing any sneaking! He’s shining, totally shining! Is how i’m enjoying this so much. To be given the chance to creating a character like this, I feel like THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! I wonder if someday his oni version will make an appearance. I’m looking forward to it. (Sasaki Shounen)
