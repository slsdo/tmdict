Ars Nova.
The First Noble Phantasm. A Noble Phantasm that belongs not to Goetia, but to the true King Solomon (Dr. Roman).
The exploits that he had fulfilled until now, the miracles that he had accomplished until now, the magic that he had achieved until now; it is a poem of parting that lets go of it all.
Upon the invocation of this Noble Phantasm, Solomon returns back to the heavens the graces that he had received from God, losing his eye that gazes at the world.
The result is the death of King Solomon. And conversely, the disintegration of the 72 demon gods.
It can be said to be the safety device that Solomon had prepared for the sake of destroying “magic”, should the time in a distant future comes when it becomes an evil for human.
…When this Noble Phantasm is employed, Solomon would vanish from even the Throne of Heroes.

Solomon’s complete evanescence implies not of erasure of all traces of Solomon, but rather that that everything that he must do now had been completed.
…Each and every living existences have things they had left undone as their time is concluded and ended. No matter how flawless they had live their life, they would always leave behind a “remnant”.
Those “remnants” will then be carried over by the people that will continue even further, bringing to forth the path of human history.

A complete evanescence means an ascenscion from this very path.
To accomplish every task one is granted with, a state of existence where one no longer has any matter undone.

There is no longer any need to defeat him, nor the need to rely on him.
No longer will anyone ask of him,
no longer will anyone bear the burden of his death,
no longer will anyone ask for his help, for his accomplishment.

That is what it means to disappear even from the Throne of Heroes.
To be released from the duty of life, to have completed all the task one is burdened with in this universe.
The messiah is the sole being among the mankind to have attained enlightenment, but the coward had attained and arrived on a “destination” of a different bearing.
