### Evocation: EX

Magic that evokes of spiritual bodies of the past, or perhaps the future.
With his Evocation ability that spoke of the summoned spiritual existences, the “Seventy Two Demon Gods”, and established them as capable familiars, he truly lived up to his title of King of Magic.

### Revelation: B

A Skill that hears of “the voice from the Heavens” and performs the most suitable of actions.
While “Instinct” is a sixth sense for combat purpose, Revelation conforms to all matters in regards of achieving a goal (such as selecting the most suitable road for travel route).
Solomon had only ever received one Revelation, but based on that he had established the phenomena operation technique--that is, magic--that even an ordinary person could perform. (Until then, magic had been a work only for those related to the gods.)

### Rings of Solomon: EX

The ten rings given by God. The mark of the king, the progenitor of magic.
In the case of all ten rings present, any and all kinds of magic performed by mankind is invalidated and put under his subordination.

### Clairvoyance: EX

Eyesight of good quality. Apprehension of long distance target and elevation of kinetic vision. When the rank is high enough, even x-ray vision or future prediction becomes possible.
Solomon’s Clairvoyance gives him unobstructed view of both the past and the future.
