### Personality

Introvert, self-assured, passive.
A gentle king that gives off a relaxed sense.
“Confidence“ is his main characteristic, but it’s actually only his ability of “unable to read the mood.” As a result, he only makes statements in a confident manner, but is actually a coward (chicken) in his basic nature.
Diligent but not earnest, he lives by putting only 80% of his maximum effort.
He poperly ascertained of the people, properly established the law, and properly governed the country.
Although he is somewhat lacking in mettle, he is a wise and kind king full of love, respected and beloved by his people.
However, all of those traits are not actually by Solomon’s own will.
From his birth, he had been ordained to be a king, to hear the voice of God and to live in accordance to it. There is no emotion within him; he is inhuman, deprived of the autonomy to symphatize with the joy and sorrow of the people.

Only when he becomes Romani Archaman that he finally acquires his original human nature.
His root is that of a pessimist and realist. Even though he speaks of wishful thinking as a moodmaker, due to himself unable to think of that as more than pipe dreams, he is quite shameless in some respects.
He loves humans, but because he’s a coward in nature who “does not want to see sad things”, he ends up limiting himself with superficial relationships. On the other hand, he is capable of being good terms with pretty much everybody. Your typical affable friendly guy.
When being faced with a dilemma, he has the bad habit of choosing to stay undecided and devoting himself to just observe, or just straight up runs away, so that the status quo is maintained.
Due to Roman himself is reflecting on that weakness of his, it only needs a few words, for someone in his surroundings to simply says “hang in there”, for him to somehow holds his ground and displays a resolution worthy of the King of Magic.

Incidentally, any Servants would end up having “I don’t know the reason but this guy’s the one at fault here” as their first impression for Roman; and due to that they will unconsciously complain about him.
The only ones who don’t judge him negatively are those who aren’t Servants, the contrarians, and the Berserkers that don’t perceive evil as evil.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He conceals the fact that he had been Solomon, collaborating with the protagonist as a human.
The first Heroic Spirit that Chaldea summoned. (Summoning Case No. 1)
He had had the premonition of the arrival of humankind’s extinction, unknown in its nature, and had been hiding himself in Chaldea as a researcher.
The reason that he keeps his true colors hidden is because he is wary against the mastermind behind the incineration of human history, and at the same time due to him feeling responsible out of fear that somehow, he is the one to blame for this.
While he does think that it is unjustifiable to the protagonist, he himself is completely unapologetic about it.
“I mean, there’s just no helping it. You can hate me all you want, I don’t mind. Actually, it would only be natural if you do. To begin with, I’m just not someone worthy for other people to like.”
Due to him undervaluing (self-torturing) himself like that, he thinks that it’s only natural for people to detest him rather than like him.

Winner of the Holy Grail War of the year 2004.
His wish upon the Grail is “to live as a human”.
In the midst of the Holy Grail War, Solomon thought of this.
“Romance. Romance, is it! Such a pleasant word. A fresh concept, one yet to exist during my time.”
A phrase that had yet to exist in his age.
A way of life where a single human freely embraces their dream.
For such a world that displays such a thing to exist.
It was because he felt, from the bottom of his heart, that it is such a magnificent thing, that Solomon decided to call himself “Roman”.
And after the Holy Grail War had concluded.
Receiving the name Romani Archaman, Roman then set out to begin his second life. Alas, he was unable to experience the fullness, the joy of being human that he had not acquire during his live.
For his freedom had been snatched away when he was shown a glimpse of the future, of the end of mankind, just as he had been made human.
Ever since then, just like an infant newly born to the world, he had to chase an enemy whose true nature he knew not of in reselessness, embarking on a lone man’s struggle.
As he, in desperation, chased after knowledge, acquired technology, and ran as if weeping in the darkness, he made it in time for the fated moment (the 2015 rayshift experiment.)

During the final stage of the first part, Roman is struck with an inner conflict when he had fathomed that Goetia was the mastermind.
He has a way of defeating Goetia.
If he could reach the Time Temple, confront Goetia before he is aware of the existence of the “last ring”, and make use of Solomon’s first Noble Phantasm, then he could make Goetia lost his invincibility.
But at the same time, it would mean his own obliteration.
The previous Solomon would just say “That, too, is fine, I suppose” and would simply be done with it. But the previous Solomon is not the current Solomon.
He is Dr. Roman now.
The king who had tasted his second life, who had been made known of the magnificence of life, is in anguish.
To resolve himself for death.
Could he overcome that fear, that remorse?

### Historical Image · Character Image

A figure who lived between BC 1000 to BC 931. The third king of ancient Israel.
The great king who had brought about grand prosperity to ancient Israel. He was the man who employed 72 demon gods and had built the first temple of Israel.

His policy as a king was excelling, but other than that he also had numerous anecdote as a magus.
Solomon had once married an Egyptian female pharaoh, but after that, God appeared in his dream and said to him: “You are worthy. Tell me of what you desire. Ask, and I shall give it to you.”
Solomon desired not of gold or power; above all that, above anything, he wished for wisdom.
God was content with his answer, for Solomon’s very answer was a sign that he possessed the qualifications to reach “true wisdom”.
Solomon’s eye was then awakened, and he was granted ten rings on both of his hands.
It was the very mark of the wise man approved by God. Later on it would be known as the Rings of Solomon, the origin of the magic that employs both angels and demons.

Even though King Solomon had accomplished that miracle only once, it is the one that reveals his wisdom. It was then made known to the people that “the king had been granted the protection of God’s own”; once was more than enough.
For anymore miracle would struck fear to the people and degrade it.
Solomon’s name as the Magic King was spread to the neighboring countries, all the while without using magic itself, and he left this world all the while known as the wise king.

### Role within the Game

The character that acts as the navigator for the protagonist throughout the seven chapters.
In the last chapter, after he had seen Mash’s last moment with his own eyes, the coward then told to himself of the end, and deployed the first Noble Phantasm.
He severed Goetia’s strength, then vanished after entrusting what comes after to the protagonist.

### Connections with Characters

#### David

His father. And yet, David and Solomon has a relatively indiferent parent-child relationship.
Even if Solomon declares that he would incinerate humankind, David would say “Mm, Solomon does say things like that” and just coolly observe.
It is the same with Solomon; even if David declares that Solomon is a failure of a human being, Solomon would say “Well, Father does say things like that” and call if off just like that.

#### Cleopatra, Ozymandias

Solomon was very fond of the Egyptian beauty, but didn’t care much for the pharaoh.

#### Galahad

The same with him, someone who was granted by God “the chance to have his prayer fulfilled”.
Solomon had wished for wisdom, but Galahad had wished for nothing.
Solomon questions “Why?” in regards of that matter, and bears a sense of inferiority that comes from his subconscious regret, thinking that “I should have done so.”

#### Goetia

With all said and done, you, aren’t you hating me a bit too much?!
