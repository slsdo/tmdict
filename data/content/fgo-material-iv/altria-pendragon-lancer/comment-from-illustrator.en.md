As for Lancer Artoria’s design, her design was settled ahead of Alter’s despite being released later. I felt like I kept in mind of an impression that Saber Artoria had legitimately evolved as I drew her. Afterwards, when the time came where it became necessary for a separate design for her role as the Lion King in Chapter 6, it resulted in us proceeding with a combination of all her Ascension states. As one would expect, if her breasts in her final Ascension were exposed during Chapter 6: Camelot, it would have totally ruined the whole Holy Selection moment, right? (Ishida Akira)
