### Magical Resistance: B

Nullifies spells that have a chant of three verses or below. Receives almost no damage even against Great Magecrafts and Greater Rituals.

### Riding: A

She is able to operate all vehicles and beasts freely except for Divine Beasts and Dragon Kinds.{{n1}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Just noting that A-rank Riding is usually not high-ranked enough for one to be able to ride Phantasmal Beasts, but it seems Artoria can do so since the description doesnâ€™t mention her being unable to ride phantasmal-ranked beasts.
