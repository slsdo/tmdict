When she materializes as a Saber, this Noble Phantasm was something that conceals her sword, but when she materializes as a Lancer, it is treated as nothing more than a “Wind Noble Phantasm”.

The Holy Lance. An anchor of storm that fastens the planet together. It is a God-Forged Armament. Its true form is said to be a tower that fastens the surface of the World onto the planet. When releasing its True Name, its rank and classification changes. It is the pillar at the Farthest Ends, shining and filled with the brilliance of the planet, even when its original power is still restricted according to the Thirteen Restraints————

The “pillar of light” that fastens the outer layer of the World onto the planet is viewed as the main body of Rhongomyniad, the Holy Lance. It is because of the existence of the Thirteen Restraints, which are endowed with the same processes as the “Holy Sword of the Planet that saves the world”, that it is barely in a state where it can succeed in taking form as a Noble Phantasm.
