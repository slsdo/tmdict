### Personality

King Arthur, the legendary Knight King who governed over Britain. A what-if King Arthur who, after emerging as a king, made the Holy Lance his main armament instead of the Holy Sword and reigned over Britain. Although she has the same appearance as the “Knight King” – aka “Goddess Rhongomyniad” – who reigned over the Holy City and had acted for the sake of leaving as many humans behind in the aftermath as the majority while the height of the great undertaking, the Incineration of the Human Order, was looming, she is essentially a different person.

Having lost her growth suspension caused by the Holy Sword, Artoria grew to a physical age suitable for a king. She became an existence closer to a Divine Spirit’s because she is using the Holy Lance, but given that her usage period of the lance was merely about a decade, her mental/spiritual make-up has not changed in a big way. However, her body has changed in a big way.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Artoria, who was summoned to Chaldea as a Servant, knows the beauty of the world. She will certainly fight together with the Master and wield all the power that she is able to hold, all for the sake of taking back the world that shines even if it is not at the Farthest Ends.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A Heroic Spirit of a “different possibility” from the normal Artoria. Although she has the form of a human, she can no longer be called a Man Heroic Spirit. Due to the properties hidden within the Holy Lance, she has changed/altered into an existence close to that of a Divine Spirit’s, a goddess if anything. While she has become more rational, and moreover, more composed than the Artoria of the Holy Sword, her human nature has not been parted with. Rather, there exists placidity in the choices she makes in proportion to how much she has grown into an adult, attaining the ideal way a king ought to be.

This version of Artoria is a Heaven Heroic Spirit that personally returned her Holy Lance at Camlann Hill, before she returned to the earth. However, the Servant “Lion King”, who has the same appearance as her, was not able to die when she was fated to die, and as a result, she became a wandering ghost while keeping onto the Holy Lance. Because the “Lion King” held onto the Holy Lance and transformed into “Goddess Rhongomyniad”, completely changing into a Divine Spirit in the process, this version of Artoria is different from the inside compared to the “Lion King”.

### Others

There are various opinions about Artoria’s physique as her body weight is not listed when she is a Lancer. Also, when she is a Lancer, she is always mounted on a horse. This time, her steed is her horse “Dun Stallion”.

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria Pendragon (Lily)

“Charming. So that too, is one of the what-ifs of the me in history huh?”

#### Artoria Pendragon

“The things that person was burdened with were equal to all of mine, were they not? I see. No, I feel like it is even less pitiful than what I had thought I would feel, you know. Instead, pride is welling up inside this chest. Since doing things like… patting her head would, as one would expect, be too impolite of me, I wonder if she would be willing to drink something like alcohol together with me instead?”

#### Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter)

“The King of the Storm? The Wild Hunt huh? I see, so it is like that.”

#### Knights of the Round Table

“I am glad that they seem to be in good health. It is good to take an occasional breather too, but… do not overdo everything, alright? Everything in moderation.”

#### Mordred

(No reaction)

#### Merlin

“Do not overdo it.”

#### Gilgamesh / Ozymandias

“Do not overdo it!”

#### Romulus

“Um, what is the expression? Ah yes, it would be nice if you ‘Rome’ in moderation as well… Anyway, I give you my gratitude.”

#### Bedivere

“Do not look after me constantly, at least not this much. You yourself materialized as a Servant of Chaldea’s Master. You should live freely, even more so in this time as such… Do not cry, Bedivere. Raise your face. I am not the me that you know, and also, you are not the Bedivere that I know, but those tears… they really pierce into my chest.”
