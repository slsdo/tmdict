### Independent Action: A

The ability to remain independent for a while even when rejecting the magical energy supply from one’s Master. As she has Rank A in this, it is possible for her to remain materialized in this world for a week even if she is without a Master.

### Goddess’s Divine Core: B

A Skill that expresses one being a perfected goddess since birth. It has the effect of preserving the absoluteness of the mind and body. It mitigates almost all mental interferences, prevents the body from growth, and prevents the figure from change no matter how many calories are absorbed. It is a composite Skill that comprises the Skill Divinity.
As she is a Pseudo-Servant, it results in the rank stopping at B.
