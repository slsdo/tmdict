### Shining Great Crown: A

A Skill that imitates even Authorities. A Shining Great Crown that expresses one among the many Authorities of the goddess Ishtar, bringing out various effects.

### Magical Energy Burst (Jewel): A+

An increase of offensive power, done by adding excessive magical energy to one’s weapon. Originally, Ishtar’s divine energy is practically almighty since she can manipulate it with complete mastery, but perhaps due to the influence coming from her possessed vessel, she became unable to accumulate magical energy on anything but jewels for some reason. It is a powerful Magical Energy Burst (damage intensification) Skill, but because there is the necessary process of charging the jewels before shooting them, its effects will be exhibited after 1 turn from the Skill’s utilization. It is somewhat difficult to use.

### Manifestation of Beauty: EX→B

The formidable charismatic nature one has as a Goddess of Beauty. A power to captivate others. Despite being in a state where it can only work as possession, it already exceeds the domain of man. Naturally, it should be a composite Skill (gauge absorption, curse, Skill sealing) that works with a powerful seduction effect as its core, but the restriction effects towards others were removed due to the strong inclination of the human possessed by her, and it essentially became a simple Charisma Skill. (Originally, it was Rank EX, but it has fallen to B.)
