### An Gal Tā Kigal Shē: Mountain Range-Shaking Firewood of Venus

An Gal Tā Kigal Shē; it means “from the great heavens towards the great earth.” In Sumerian Mythology, it is the most “devastating” and “atrocious” deed that Ishtar carried outーーーーfrom her anecdote of trampling down and annihilating the Sacred Mountain Ebih, which was revered and feared even by the King of Gods, “simply because I am displeased with it.” Ishtar forced her way into Mount Ebih, increasing her heavenly might with each step, and in the end, she grabbed a hold of the mountain range’s summit and thrusted her spear into the heart of the leyline, causing the Ebih mountain range to collapse. Another name for this is the Jabal Hamrin Breaker.

While in the middle of her Noble Phantasm, she warps to Venus; however, this is not the Venus in the outer space of the modern era’s, but rather, the Venus in the outer space during the time of the age of mythology. Afterwards, grabbing (the concept of) Venus and loading it onto her bow as a bullet, the Venus Blaster shoots this Venus that had been turned into a bullet towards the Earth (surface), and from another person’s perspective, it casually warps into the modern era’s airspace through the utilization of displacement magic. The mountain range that was a nuisance to others, even to the Earth and to Venus, is accordingly destroyed by this Venus.

### Gugalanna Strike: Bull of Heaven

Temporarily summons the “Bull of Heaven”, the greatest and strongest Divine Beast that was once dispatched to destroy Uruk on behalf of the goddess Ishtar. The “Bull of Heaven” appears in the skies and pulverizes the ground with its very large hooves. Large destruction is done similar to a meteorite falling down (meteor strike). It looks like a shining sky is falling down. It is as if the sky is blanketed with the Morning Star emitting a beautiful light, but it is actually a large golden hoof coming down to pulverize everything that is in the space between the sky and the ground. The attack deals a large damage, regardless of friend and foe, and temporarily bestows a rank down effect (heavy pressure) to one’s entire parameters, but only Ishtar herself does not receive any of the damage and effects.

When releasing the True Name, there are words being spoken similar to the ones spoken when utilizing a portion of the “Authority” possessed by the (original) source of the goddess Ishtar, but in any event, one of their Noble Phantasms are exactly the same. Since it is not the case that it works as the physical materialization of Bull of Heaven, it is also possible to employ this Noble Phantasm while confined by the space called “the indoors”, all done without destroying the structure. In “Fate/Grand Order”, it is not used because of some existing circumstances.
