### Personality

Active and extroverted. The goddess of war and good harvests that lives according to her own whims without being a slave to her own fixed position, all while having high intelligence and pride. Ishtar loves beautiful things, hates ugly things, and the things she desires are the things she absolutely takes hold of in her own hands. Even though she is smart, she is impulsive, and sometimes leaves with an unthinkable reckless abandon. In myths, Ishtar is commented by Gilgamesh as thus: “Inanna? Is she not the most annoying goddess in the world!? She will destroy something that certainly does not need to be destroyed, and she will also create something that does not need to be created!” If Ishtar becomes ostentatious in this world, then surely in that way, she will invite chaos simultaneously.

The root of Ishtar’s personality does not have any changes even when materialized as a Servant. It cannot be helped that Rin, who is the possessed vessel, almost has the same nature as Ishtar’s as well. However, there is one thing that Rin has that Ishtar does not. That is “perseverance”. Rin is a hardworking person who is not negligent in her trainings even though she is a genius. She knows perseverance, which appears to be giving a little influence on this Ishtar. Incidentally, Rin became independent after losing her father when she was very young, while Ishtar behaved like a spoiled child up to the very end towards her almighty father.

Ishtar is the exact opposite of Kongming (Zhuge Liang) – who is identical to her by being another Pseudo-Servant – in that the human personality, the basis of the possessed human, does not come out to the surface. Ishtar thinks and behaves as Ishtar to the very end. Although she thinks to herself “Is it because I am just being a destructive god?”, Rin’s innate goodness is mixed in with that creed as this Ishtar, and the following changes were made:

- “I must be the most beautiful” → (“If there is someone more beautiful than me, I will strive to become more beautiful then”)
- “I will kill anyone who opposes me” → (“If I made someone cry because I went too far in killing someone, I would rather stop then”)
- “I will tolerate anyone who is faithful to me” → (“I will lend my power only in proportion to the faith you have in me”)

Openly like this, Ishtar’s cruelty is held back, and when assessing this as Rin Tohsaka, it at least becomes “Ah, I became just a little higher than usual.” Also, Ishtar herself is not conscious of Rin being her possessed body. “I am myself. Whatever human this possessed body was, is now the goddess Ishtar herself. Think of it like this. Instead of saying this human was taken over by Ishtar, it is rather that suddenly on one day, she became Ishtar as well.” Although it openly sounds like she is making light of Rin’s human rights, it actually means the exact opposite. Ishtar recognizes that “if Rin Tohsaka is Ishtar, then it means Ishtar is Rin Tohsaka, regardless if it is from something like whoever is on top, to whichever one of them accepts this current state of things.” Although she will absolutely not say this.

To say it in a few words, a “Tohsaka of Light (yet a devil)”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

A human worth teasing. Although she thinks of herself as someone celebrated, Ishtar will not do things such as looking down on someone given that there is Rin’s basis. She comes into contact with her Master with deep affections and friendship, although simply as “a toy worth teasing.” However, as their bonds deepens, the virtue of taking care of people that she has since the beginning and her emotional weakness (of completely emphasizing with someone) works against her, and they grow from “a toy worth teasing” into “my cherished contractor, whose future is worth watching over.”

### Dialogue Examples

“Ouch!!… Those cruel eyes… they unexpectedly shot up from the ground… Though, it was good luck that I suffered less damage than what I had thought I would. Since my usual high-handedness (actions) are also good for thisーーーーW-What are youーーーー!”
“I am not doing that! A Master freely using their Servant, just as I thought it would be! Such things like a goddess’s responsibilities or human logic, I wanted to come on board without those sorts of involvements! Gear, go and give it to them!”
“WーーーーWhat is that luggage, and when did the storm lapis lazuli get in there!? A crown? By some chance, is that… not the seven-jeweled crown too!? There is nothing to worry about with these jewels being used for magic if it is just this… Lies… eh? That one gave me this!? A god!?”
“I will not say things like, I lied midway, right? *panicking* My eyes have become dizzy, calm down me! And Ishtar (me)!”
“So it is like that. Although it is a provisional contract, Ishtar has become a Servant of Chaldea. You do not think I am boring, so since that is the case, I will ask you for a favour. Please treat me favourably, ok?☆”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Ishtar is the goddess of beauty, lust and discord in Sumerian Mythology. Her Sumerian divine name was said to be Inanna, and that name is actually her older name. Ishtar is her Akkadian divine name. It means “The Mistress of Heaven”. A goddess of Venus, a goddess who governs over the good harvests that brings prosperity to the people, and even a goddess who rules over war and destruction, she is a great goddess who, among the goddesses, was presented with many rights and Authorities from the gods. In Sumerian Mythology, she plays an active role as a dynamic goddess and as a goddess who is like the heroine of a story, possessing various anecdotes. Particularly among them, a famous one is her feeding the city of Uruk to the “Bull of Heaven”, seemingly an anecdote that caused the city to be on the brink of destruction.

At any rate, Ishtar is a whimsy deity that is free and uncontrolled, and it is said that she has many lovers, irrespective of them being from the domain of man or from the domain of the gods. She is a deity who was perfected as a deity, one who usually took control and command of things. There is no compromise. The motive for bringing out the Divine Beast onto the Earth was said to be the result of the Hero-King, Gilgamesh of Uruk, having not responded to her temptations.

### Role within the Game

In “Fate/Grand Order”, Ishtar has materialized as a Pseudo-Servant by possessing a human. Since Ishtar is egotistical, she behaves without paying any regard to the possessed human, but her nature is receiving a big influence from the human that was possessed. Originally, Ishtar is both deeply compassionate and cruel, but because the personality of the possessed human is more virtuous, her cruelty has retreated to the bottom of her heart, and her good side appears to have come out ahead of it.

In Chapter 7, Ishtar appeared as the only living Sumerian deity. By becoming a Pseudo-Servant, she manifested on the lands of Mesopotamia, attentively watching the Seventh Singularity and the future of humanity. Although she says she is attentively watching them, she is watching over them while letting out an evil sneer. “Well then. I wonder if the humans will survive this, or will they be destroyed?” By chance, she happens to see the protagonist persevering as a mere human being while losing their Servants, being a favourite among those she teases, and temporarily links a contract with them. In the end, she proves to be a literal “Goddess of Victory”.

Ishtar is always floating lightly because she is not the “Goddess of Earth”, but the “Goddess of Heaven”. The main weapon of her choice is the “Boat of Heaven Maanna”, which is both an airship and an enormous bow. Maanna is the boat of the gods that soars across the Mesopotamian World, and it is also an interstellar teleportation stargate (gate) that connects between Earth and Venus, but because she is a Pseudo-Servant, except during the occasion of using her Noble Phantasm, its warp function is sealed. While called a Mesopotamian deity, her image is like that of an invader flying in from Venus to attack the Earth. Bibyu.

Also, it is a digression, but regarding the battle against Ishtar in one section of the Seventh Singularity’s Tenth Chapter, she had a Passive Skill called “Broken Lapis Lazuli Necklace”. Because it is broken, its original effect becomes the exact opposite (Noble Phantasm damage reduced by 30%). Ishtar herself realizes that negative effect, but daringly wears it. Even if it is for this reason: “It is still beautiful, and I wanted to flaunt it; plus, if I think about this conversely, even if it starts to act up violently and flare up, I am not going to suffer damage because I am already suffering from its debuff, right?” Or so she thinks. But she ignores pointing out that she had used her Noble Phantasm, which caused it to act up violently in the first place.
