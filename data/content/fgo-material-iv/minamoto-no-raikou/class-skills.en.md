### Magic Resistance: D

Nullifies Single-Action spells. A Magic Resistance of the same degree of an amulet that rejects magical energy.
If she was in her original Class, she would possess B-rank Magic Resistance, but as a result of her attribute being changed, it has ranked down.

### Mad Enhancement: EX

A Skill that strengthens one’s physical abilities in exchange for their sense of reason.
In Raikou’s case, her reason is not lost, and her state of being remains as her original intellectual self. However, with the impurity of her Oni blood, that mentality became morally broken because of the manifestation of her maternal love that is so far as abnormal. (She would eliminate anyone and everyone for the sake of her beloved ones, and she would protect them fanatically.) While talking of proper love, she does not hold a sight of social morals if it is for the sake of love, approving all kinds of deeds… that is to say, she is mentally ill. She draws a line from other Berserkers by not letting others be on the verge of truly perceiving that broken side of her’s. Fundamentally, persuading her, or making her correct her ways, is impossible.

### Riding: A+

She is able to operate all vehicles and beasts freely except for Dragon Kinds. Being able to ride comes from Gozu Tennou, who is a god.

### Divinity: C

Raikou was born as the heaven-sent child of Gozu Tennou, so she possesses the Divinity Skill.
