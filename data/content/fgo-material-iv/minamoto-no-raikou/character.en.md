### Personality

An elegant, virtuous and glamorous woman in the prime of her youth. While a cool-headed military woman, Raikou is also a beautiful woman overflowing with tolerance. Surely the personification of maternal love.

Raikou is a diligent career soldier, but she becomes a doting crybaby prone to worrying when concerning matters related to Kintoki. As a matter of fact, she is passive and introverted. Although she is seen as a person with a good sense to make peace pleasant for everyone, because her true nature (a nature mixed with Divinity) is inhuman, she grasps everything in an overlooking manner, as well as in a big-picture perspective. On the other hand, her affection towards those she came to like is strong, becoming the embodiment of maternal love that “makes the world her enemy if it is for the sake of her child.” For her, a “lover” is equal to “her own child”. Raikou herself does not really notice how out of sync that way of perceiving things is.

During moments where she looks after Kintoki, Raikou would not say that she had said “Kintoki. I will discipline you not as your older sister, but as your mother”, among other things. Thereafter, her first pronoun towards Kintoki became “mother”.

Raikou, since birth, has continually suffered for she had thought of herself as something “close to a demon”, even if she has the blood of a god. Below her devotions, such as responding to the expectations of her father, and defending the Imperial Capital, she is constantly bearing a viewpoint that “I am not a human being.” She cannot live as a human being, and she also cannot live as a demonic being.

For that sort of Raikou, the encounter with Sakata Kintoki, who had been backing her up as one of her guardians, and who possesses a similar mixed-race origin much like herself, albeit weaker than her own’s, grew to be a little salvation for her. Raikou swore that “although I cannot become familiar with you as an older sister, I will discipline you as a mother”, and that was also her purpose in not letting Kintoki be exposed to the experience of the same solitude she had suffered. To her father, she was thrown away as unnecessary, and for Raikou, she did not experience maternal love, but the days of disciplining Kintoki as a substitute parent were her only “human days”.

Such days were also the bygone days, and one day, Kintoki became an adult. A new demon appeared in the Imperial Capital. That was Shuten-douji. Boasting “freedom as a demonic being” and doing as she likes, Shuten-douji enjoyed herself in the world of humans, and that very state was “what I wanted to be.” Disdain. Envy. Jealousy. Yearning. For Raikou, Shuten-douji was a “close stranger” who mixed up her feelings just like that. As for Raikou herself, she did not assail Shuten-douji aggressively compared to the other criminals. Because up to a time, she ascertained that Shuten-douji was an acquaintance of Kintoki from his childhood days.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As far as Raikou is concerned, the Master who became her contractor is an earnest salvation that had appeared in the darkness. Continuing from Kintoki, she sees her Master as a person she was fated to meet, who accepted and contracted with her as a demonic being. Speaking of that doting, it is as fierce as it can be. However, given that she has a strong desire to monopolize them, she will press a question with a sick look as if she had suffered from one being unfaithful to her, and she will cry immediately if she sees her Master averting their gaze. Speaking of her maternal love, it gives off an impression of thoughtfulness, but her maternal love goes way too far, becoming “a conversion of the child into her own possession, and snatching away all of their freedom and future.” Although Raikou’s affections are at the stage of insanity, Raikou’s own high intelligence and strong sense of reason does not make this aspect be noticed as such (even to the people in the vicinity, as well as to Raikou herself).

### Dialogue Examples

“I am called Minamoto no Raikou. While I am not yet competent in this state to act in the position of a general, I request you treat me well please.”
“Oh dear. Since you are a naughty child, you have become so bloody.”
“… You’re… an eyesore.” (During moments of having malice)
“If you say such a thing, I might cry…” (Crying soon)
“Aah… What fault did mother seem to do…?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A person of the 10th~11th Century. Born as the eldest son of the Minamoto clan, Minamoto no Raikou is a figure who contributed to the development of the entire Seiwa Genji line as the founder of the Settsu Genji branch. He is also the strongest Mystery Slayer of the Heian period who destroyed many monstrosities, such as “Shuten-douji of Mount Ooe”, the “Giant Spider of the Imperial Capital”, and “Ushi-Oni of Sensou-ji”. Leading her subordinates, Raikou’s Four Heavenly Kings – Watanabe Tsuna, Sakata Kintoki, Urabe Suetake and Usui Sadamitsu – she continued to protect the peace of the capital. Naturally, he is a male in historical fact.

### Old Joururi: “The True Form of Ushi-Gozen” (Outline)

The child of Minamoto no Mitsunaka, who was born as the heaven-sent child of Gozu Tennou, was left in the care of a temple as an unwanted child and was raised in secret because of his abnormal birth (being the child of an Oni). On the occasion of turning 15 years old, the unwanted child gave himself the name “Ushi-Gozen”, and he built up a demonic country for himself at Suzugamori, Shinagawa. The ones who departed to exterminate him was Minamoto no Raikou, a samurai who has the same father as him, and the Four Heavenly Kings that were commanded by Raikou.

Meanwhile, it was Sakata Kintoki who decided in his mind to save only Ushi-Gozen’s life during the extermination in any way possible. Away from the capital for a mission, Kintoki proceeded towards the base of Ushi-Gozen instead, but negotiations broke down. The subordinates of Ushi-Gozen were closed in and destroyed by the Four Heavenly Kings, as well as by Raikou, who were all accompanying Kintoki while hidden.

Already up to this point, Gozen entered into the Asakusa River (Sumida River), and he would grow into the shape of a huge ox with a bodily height of approximately ten shaku, before he would spout water at the enemy armies, drowning many people to death. Ushi-Gozen noticed that the figures of the Four Heavenly Kings were not in sight among the enemy ranks, so he broke into a gallop towards the enemy camp, took along seven brawny samurai and eight horsemen with him against their will, and left these words behind as he submerged to the bottom of Asakusa River: “In a short span of time, I will become thunder and head towards the capital.”

The episode regarding Raikou’s half-brother. Although he is precisely Raikou’s younger brother, there is a theory that he was thought to be a “woman” because of the name “Gozen”. (The Ushi-Oni is a monster that possesses the special characteristic of frequently “taking on the form of a woman”, and the Ushi-Oni also appears before Minamoto no Raikou in the “Taiheiki”, taking on the form of “his mother”.)

In addition, Ushi-Gozen is the avatar of Gozu Tennou, and Gozu Tennou is the incarnation of Taishakuten (Indra).

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In “Fate/Grand Order”, Raikou appears as a woman. This person is the true figure of Minamoto no Raikou, and “Ushi-Gozen” is the younger sister of Minamoto no Raikou in the old Joururi, “The True Form of Ushi-Gozen”————

The way of these things came from an interpretation. The daughter of Minamoto no Mitsunaka, who was born as the heaven-sent child of Gozu Tennou, was left in the care of a temple as a male and was raised in secret because of her abnormal birth (being an Oni child). On the occasion of turning 15 years old, she was brought back to the capital to play an active role, being gifted the name Minamoto no Raikou. Her name was established as a military commander who, on the surface, drove away many Mysteries, taking on in the beginning Ushi-Oni (who is close to her in a sense). Consequently, the episodes of “Sakata Kintoki protecting Ushi-Gozen, who had fallen into a predicament of being driven into a corner”, “the life and death struggle between Minamoto no Raikou and the demonic Ushi-Gozen”, etc., as depicted in “The True Form of Ushi-Gozen”, were somehow actually speaking of the events…

… of the conflicts with herself. For the purpose of launching herself to the center stage of history as a central figure of the Minamoto clan, Minamoto no Raikou was attempting to detach “Ushi-Gozen”, who is by definition the aspect of her demonic nature/strange form. Speaking of the modern era, the land that corresponds to Tokyo was where Raikou contended against her tempestuous self by means of a deep meditation. Raikou faced with “Ushi-Gozen”… the demon inside her, and Ushi-Gozen finally separated from Raikou, manifesting as an avatar of Gozu Tennou. The sky became a storm, the thunder roared chaotically, and the earth broke apart. Raikou was to “kill herself” together with the Four Heavenly Kings in order to defeat this being.

Given the situation, it became obvious what the reason was for Sakata Kintoki to start protecting Ushi-Gozen in the middle of this battle. Kintoki pondered about Raikou, his substitute parent when he was being brought up, and he understands that killing Ushi-Gozen will also kill Raikou as the two are linked. Kintoki, in order to save Raikou, needs to “kill while keeping alive” Ushi-Gozen————In other words, preaching the power of the love between parent and child, he saw the conclusion as Ushi-Gozen was sealed (returned back) inside of Raikou.
