Given that I received a clear concept from Mr. Nasu himself during the time of design, it became quite troublesome on how I changed the clothing design of a character of the same name that I drew before. Concerning the results, I think it has gotten better. It is a good memory of how we did a nice correspondence of letters on guessing what faces were drawn on them. (Hiroe Rei)
