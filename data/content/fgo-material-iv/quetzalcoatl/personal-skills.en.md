### Good God’s Wisdom: A+

A Skill that shows the wisdom of having taught many people.
Except for those that are a burden to the body (such as Divinity) and those that are characteristic of certain heroes, many Skills can be practically demonstrated at a proficiency of A Rank. It is also possible to endow these Skills towards other Servants. If she has sufficient magical energy, it is also possible for Quetzalcoatl to endow them to existences that are not Servants.
Originally, it is a kind of Authority, but it has deteriorated into a Skill because she has materialized as a bunrei.
