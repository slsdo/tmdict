### Personality

The same Marie Antoinette as always. Given that it is the resort, she is slightly in high spirits. She feels that royalty is at home in a summer resort. Having successfully materialized in a swimsuit, she does not really care about the large amount of skin exposure. Marie Antoinette continues to sparkle beautifully, pleasantly, and gorgeously. Concerning her appearance, because she is rather unmindful of it, it may not be known that in the eyes of others, she comes out all the more boldly.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Basically the same as usual. Spending every summer day with Marie Antoinette seems to be, genuinely, letting one have a dream of a real celebrity vacation. Since it is a dream, they will wake up someday, but memories of it will undoubtedly be left behind.

### Dialogue Examples

“Hey, I like the beach. I love it! You, as well as everybody, let’s all surely enjoy it, alright?ーーーーVive la France!”
“Oh? Mr. Crab got on my head. Hehe, nice to meet you Mr. Crab!”
“Are you going out to play? May I also play together with you?”
“A vacances is fun. Although there are occasionally serious matters too, it’s nonetheless fun!”
“Hey, I like new things. Let’s quickly go make things livelier!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

It is completely the same as the time when she materialized as a Rider.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Whether at the royal palace or at the beach, a queen consort is a queen consort. She is Marie Antoinette as she still is, even if her Saint Graph has been tinkered with by Scáthach. Nevertheless, she is somewhat in high spirits, and compared to her materialization as a Rider, the number of times she smiles has increased by a tiny bit. Unnoticed goes the crab that got on her head (only in her first stage Ascension).

Marie uses a beach ball in combat. Or more precisely, there is a possibility that Marie herself is merely playing with a ball at the beach, all while not being aware of the battle.

### General Armaments

A beach ball as mentioned above. Umph!

### Amadeus

“Oh, goodness gracious! As I expected, you’re looking quite pale. Your face has become pure white. Let’s take a break somewhere. Ok?
W-WhatーーーーMy third stage Ascension is dangerous? In what way?”

### Charles-Henri Sanson

“Ah, Sanson. Hey, please look, Miss Scáthach prepared a swimsuit for me… Huh? Sanson? Why aren’t you looking this way for me?”

### Chevalier d’Eon

“Hey, come, you should enjoy your vacances too! Hehehe. Look here, I chose some clothes and swimsuits that seems to suit you nicely. Ah, that’s right, it might also be a good idea to walk to the merchant shop and find something together!”

### Scáthach

“Merci mille fois. For the first time in a while, I relished in the mood for a vacances.”
