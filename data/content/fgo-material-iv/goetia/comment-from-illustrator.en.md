[MAP Goetia] I did it by shaping the demon pillar into a bundled echinodermata basket fish shape. Because it was such an enormous structure there are heaps of details on it.
[Demon pillars] The design is developed from the same color design as Tiamatâ€™s Black Sakura [black and red streak] coloring. I was delighted when the variations of the demon pillars that I submitted with doubt in mind were all used. It was a pleasure, seeing the demon pillars arrangement keep on being created^^
[Humanoid Goetia] The combining my draft for the humanoid Goetia and the desain for his shoulders and such from the staffs, the fusion and exchange between it, was quite a hard but enjoyable composition. (Yamanaka Kotetsu)

I am filled with memories and emotion in various of ways.
Speaking in terms of design, I do have some regrets left for ended up jamming various things in, but exactly because of that that his last form gives off a very refreshed feeling. (Takeuchi Takashi)
