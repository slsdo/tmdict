Ars Paulina.{{n2}}
The Second Noble Phantasm. The Time Temple Solomon. The last stage for FateGO’s first part.
It compiles the human history converted into magic energy, a governed space.
It exists in the imaginary space separated from the normal flow of time.
Goetia himself remains within this Temple, grinning and laughing as he assures each and every era being extinguished.
It is a Reality Marble that Goetia fabricated by amplifying the remains of King Solomon; its structure is the same as Fate/stay night’s Justeaze’s Great Holy Grail.

The First Noble Phantasm. While Goetia knows that this is “the Noble Phantasm belonging to the other Solomon”, he is not aware of the detail.
No. He is unable to be aware of it.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} From my limited knowledge of the language, Ars means Art, Almadel (or Almandal) being apparently some sort of altar, amd Salomonis is Solomon. Ars Almadel is also 4th book of the lesser of Clavicula Salomonis aka Key of Solomon. So it sort of literally means Solomon’s Art of Altar and indeed, the book itself speaks about creation of altar to contact angels and scrying. I suppose the lightbelt is being likened to altar, and the heat value conversion is the ceremony here. Here’s the picture of the Almadel from the book.
2. {{note2}} Ars Paulina is the third book of Clauvica Salomonis. It literally means Art of Pauline. Pauline itself apparently means anything that has connection to St. Paul the apostle. The book itself speaks of twenty four angels aligned with twenty four hours of the day, and 360 spirits of the degrees of zodiac. The 360 degree and 24 hours is probably likened to how we fight in a circle area inside Ars Paulina back at Solomon chapter.
3. {{note3}} It literally means Art of the New. Only relevant bit i could find is this bit on the fifth book, the Ars Notoria that contains a series of prayers intended to grant eidetic memory (photographic memory) and instantaneous learning to the magician. Quoting the Ars Goetia: Book of Orations and Prayers which Wise Solomon did use upon the Altar in the Temple. The which is called ARS NOVA, the which was revealed to Solomon by that Holy Angel of God called Michael; and he also received many brief Notes written with the Finger of God, which were declared to him by the said Angel with Claps of Thunder; without which Notes King Solomon had never obtained his Great Wisdom, for by them in short time he gained Knowledge of all Arts and Sciences both Good and Bad; from these Notes it is called THE NOTARY ART.
