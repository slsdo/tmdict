### Territory Creation: A

Creation of a “Workshop”{{n1}} territory that is advantageous to himself as a magus.
That ability of his that had created the Temple of Jerusalem is of the highest peak of Territory Creation.

### High Speed Incantation: A

The ability to hasten magic incantation speed.
Formerly his incantation speed is only average, but now it is comparable to High Speed Divine Words.
That is due to the inside being Goetia, and thus his weakness from when he was alive… his characteristic weakness… isn’t there.

### Tool Creation: C

Creation of tools tinged with magic energy.
Perhaps because he is specialized in contracts, his Tool Creation ability is on average level.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Funny how other’s with Rank A Territory Creation always has that additional line about them having “temple” instead of “workshop” but not Goetia. Another case of copypasting mistake in this book? or maybe talking about Jerusalem temple already counts as “Temple”?
