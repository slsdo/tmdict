### Personality

Under the moonlight, a man-eating flower is glamourously in full bloom to the extent that it is stealing away the eyes of those watching. A demon wearing a girl’s form, narrowing her eyes and licking her lips with her seductive tongue. It may not be known that although her outward appearance properly resembles a human girl, Shuten-douji is not a human being. Even though she seems to communicate with words openly like a human being, she is essentially different from human beings. Her preferences are similar to a human’s, but for her to love something is especially said to be a theory, from the idea that if she suddenly killed the things she loved with her own hands, it could not be understood by humans as love. Although she knows love, requests love, and clasps love to her breasts, it is impossible to overlap that love with the right people. Her love is accompanied with blood; her love spreads death; her love tears one’s heart. The impulse hidden below her white naked body is surely swelling up, being twisted, and rolling over from side to side.
Therefore.
One can say with confidence that she is a demon.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Shuten-douji does not speak of her wish for the Holy Grail. Just like how she was when she was alive, going wherever her fancy takes her, she thinks and behaves as she likes, not being any different whether she is in the bygone days or in the present days.
In addition, Shuten-douji is also a collector of antiques and rarities, even having a keen interest in the Red Dragon’s ulna dwelling in Kintoki’s arm. It appears that she attaches an importance to an article’s rarity and the elegance of their appearance, so she is incompatible with, for instance, the Hero King who attaches an importance to an article’s performance and history.

### Dialogue Examples

“Heehee. Thank you very much… for summoning me. Although I’ll be doing things as it suits me————There’s no problem with that yes?”
“Thank you… very much.”
“Though you don’t need to be afraid of me to such an extent; I won’t pull out your bones, y’know? Heehee. Good child, good child.”
“Yesterday as well as today, you’re quite a… fairly busy person. Although it’d be fine if you lounged around a bit instead of working so busily.”
“Yes, that’s right————It’d please me if you died.”

### Character Image

The boss that governed the Oni within the castle structure on Mount Ooe during the Heian period. There are various theories about Shuten-douji’s origins. There is a theory where she is considered the child of a human and the Great God Ibuki of Mount Ibuki (= Yamata no Orochi), and there is another theory where she is considered the heaven-sent child of Mount Togakushi (= Kuzuryuu). At any rate, she is the child of a Dragon God, possessing a shared background with Sakata Kintoki.

Because of the disappearances of young men and princesses at the Imperial Capital happening one after another, Abe no Seimei was in the process of doing a divination, and he ascertained the matter to be the deed of Shuten-douji. Raikou’s Four Heavenly Kings, lead by Minamoto no Raikou himself, was ordered to subjugate her, arriving at the Oni’s castle while dressed in itinerant Buddhist monk attires. At the banquet, Raikou and the others made Shuten-douji and her group drink poisoned sake, then attacked them while they were asleep, punishing them. The removed head of Shuten-douji’s attacked Raikou, but it is said that the attack was thwarted due to the latter’s helmet given by a god.

In this work, it is Ibaraki-douji who is the boss and ringleader of the Oni on Mount Ooe, and Shuten-douji was perching on the Oni palace of Mount Ooe as some kind of house guest————That was the taken point of view. However, the one who is viewed as an ancestor to the gods, Ibuki-douji, that is to say, the existence of Shuten-douji, is certainly adequate enough to draw the attention of the authorities of ancient Kyoto, Abe no Seimei, and the others. Surely, the most dangerous existence among the Oni of Mount Ooe is no doubt Shuten-douji, so to speak.

Whether she is the direct “child” of the Great God Ibuki, or whether she is a “descendant” who succeeded its blood, it is not clear. In the end, Shuten-douji herself does not speak about her origins. The alias called Ibuki-douji is just something attached to her by Ibaraki-douji, who saw the true nature of Yamata no Orochi’s power in her. It may not be discovered that Shuten-douji herself has forgotten her past and the likes of it. As long as there is beguiling alcohol, brilliant banquets and enjoyable performances, she has no regrets.

And yet… from the way it seems, one cannot conclude that Shuten-douji had completely forgotten her past regarding the existence of Sakata Kintoki, one who possesses origins similar to her own (being the child of a man-eating witch and a Dragon God), the man hanging in her mind ever since the time when he was young.

Shuten-douji’s connection with Sakata Kintoki continues on since that time. Given that this companion was easy to tease on some occasions, she had a good time while being accompanied with snacks and alcohol. As far as Shuten is concerned, they are no more than drinking bouts, but as far as Kintoki is concerned, they are demonic banquets that would kill him if he took the atmosphere lightly. “To struggle for life while intoxicated in alcohol. Isn’t it romantic to cheat each other while hugging our bodies?” That is Shuten’s eloquence.

#### Sakata Kintoki

“Fufu. That blond-haired, blue-eyed youngster. As usual…”
As a matter of fact, she thinks it is better to take off those sunglasses. If she sees a chance, she will take them off.

#### Ibaraki-douji

“By the way, when my decapitated head was laid down at Mount Ooe, like that, I thought this was farewell from this world, and from this Ibaraki. ’Twas a strange relationship we had. Sharpening my horn like that even in this morning, that naughty kid hasn’t changed, you know.”

#### Minamoto no Raikou

“What, a cow is mooing? Fufu, I wonder what it is.”

#### Raikou’s Four Heavenly Kings

“Ibaraki would be delighted if Master Tsuna came around, no? Oh Ibaraki, your face is deeply red from this sort of thing? What what, are you spouting out blood from your forehead in that much rage from having heard Tsuna’s name? Yes, that’s good.”

#### Abe no Seimei

“(Laughing) Eh? What? After all, it can’t be helped that it’s amusing.”

#### Tamamo-no-Mae

“Ohhhhhhh. Hmm. That fox, so she’s that kind of woman here. Well that is very… you know…?”

#### Onra / Otakemaru / King Akuro

“Come to think of it, I don’t see them appearing around here. You know, we are said to be all anti-heroes, so it seems to be difficult to summon them. Ah, that’s not true. There’s a way to summon them, yes.”

#### Kouga Saburou and his family line

“For me to utter about them, there is no reason to. Truly, intolerable————”
