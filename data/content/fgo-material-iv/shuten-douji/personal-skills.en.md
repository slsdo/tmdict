### Alcoholic Scent of Fruits: A

Targets can be made dead drunk, similar to being charmed even, from one’s tone of voice, sigh, or even just their gaze that possesses the aroma of a fruit’s alcoholic scent. If they are beings that do not have the means for magical defense (common people and animals), their thoughts will end up melting completely in an instant. Essentially a Charisma Skill and a charm Skill, it is a composite Skill of both Skills. Even if they are Servants, there is a likelihood for them to feel charmed if they do not have the means to defend against this. It is even possible to eventually throw the targets into insanity.

### Demon of the Oni Species: A

A Skill that represents the superpower and demonic nature of an oni. With the exception of oni and those that are mixed-race beings with Oni blood, one is not able to acquire this Skill. It is even a mixed Skill of the Natural Monster Skill, Monstrous Strength Skill, Charisma Skill, Magical Burst Skill, etc., but in Fate/Grand Order, the effects has been adjusted. The form of an oni’s Magical Burst is commonly thought of as something related to “Heat”.

### Battle Continuation: A+

The ability to continue combat.
Combat is possible even when receiving a decisive fatal wound.
Because of the folklore where she attacked Minamoto no Raikou, combat is possible even if her head is decapitated.
