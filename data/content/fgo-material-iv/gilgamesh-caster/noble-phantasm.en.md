Gate of Babylon.
Fundamentally the same Noble Phantasm he possesses as an Archer.
By connecting the space around him with Babylon, he pulls out an innumerable amount of magic wands and mystic code and utilize magic. In the magic wands and mystic codes, the great thaumathurgy of the age of the gods is loaded. Due to the display of effects and invocation that mostly does not consume the user’s magic energy, it is a Noble Phantasm that excels in its extraordinary cost performance.
Utilized in normal attacks, its True Name release is not utilized in FateGO.

Melam Dingir{{n1}}.
Long distance raid bombing from the stronghold of Uruk. An amazing bombardment that concentrates the total force of not only the wise king Gilgamesh, but also the people of Uruk who lived in the age of the gods. In FateGO, it possesses the effect of raising allies defensive power after attacking all the opponents.

Gilgamesh with great sorrow loads the catapults with his personal collection, then leaves it at the hands of the soldiers.
“Broken Phantasm? I did that already more than 4000 years ago!”

Sha Naqba Imuru{{n2}}.
Spreading through the corners of the earth just like the radiance of a star, he sees through everything; the oldest of heroes, the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh. This is his spirituality, turned into a Noble Phantasm.
He sees through be it the enemy’s True Name or Noble Phantasm, or even the truth concealed in multiple layers by simply a glance.
Normally a continuously active Noble Phantasm, but in FateGO its True Name release is not performed.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Melam Dingir’s name presumably comes from melam (melammu in akkadian), a concept of ancient Mesopotamian divinity, which is a "mantle of radiance" type of blazing light that is worn like a garment depicted like a light aura that surrounds a deity or demon, and dingir which is simply Sumerian words for god, used to denote religious names and related concepts. So literally Godly Divine Radiance?
2. {{note2}} Sha Naqba Imuru is an incipit that actually is written in the Epic of Gilgamesh, meaning “He who Saw the Deep”, or in modern terms: “He who Sees the Unknown”.
