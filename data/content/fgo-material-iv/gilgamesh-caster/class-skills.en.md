### Tool Creation (Fake): A

Creation of tools tinged with magic energy.
Gilgamesh, who is originally not a magus, does not possess this Skill. However, by means of the existence of his Noble Phantasm he gained an ability equal to it. The created (taken out from his Noble Phantasm) tools are all “treasures from within the vault of Babylon.”
By using this Skill, he is able to make use of various magic tools and miracle drugs.

### Territory Creation: A

Not only can he produce tools as a magus, he is even able to manufacture constructions. To begin with, the stronghold of Uruk was by Gilgamesh’s design. Due to the limit of stone and clay constructions, “I need more lumbers. I suppose it would not do to not visit the cedar forest…”
he muttered.
The king wished not to go to the cedar forest, where one matter regarding Enkidu left its traces there.

### Divinity: B (A+)

Originally he possesses the highest Divinity rank of A+, but due to him not harboring any good impression in regards of the gods, the rank declines.
