### Dialogue Examples

“This is not a response to your summon. Do not get attached to me, mongrel.”
“I am busy. Do not take up more of my time.”
“Every treasures in this world belongs to me. It is exactly due to that that I can even manifest as a Caster.”
“To bind myself with using only magic is, too, the king’s magnamity.”
“Rejoice, mongrel! And disappear!”

### Personality

The supreme wise king who had returned from his journey for immortality.
He is told of as “he who sees everything” in the legend.
At times ruthless, a times approves of humanity; the great king of Uruk that sternly guides of the people.
That state of being is different from how he is as an Archer. He is not the hero who embodies malevolent force, but the wise king that supervises of the people.

“Fuhahaha, it is an obvious thing if you just look at my alignment! Most penance and ordeals I can overcome, but death form overwork is the one thing I never want to experience again!”

He guards his back more compared when he is as the king of heroes, and so his meagerness during battle has increased.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As a matter of fact, his attitude towards the Master does not appear to be much different from that as an Archer, but…
There is a majority opinion among the staff members of Chaldea that that manifesting figure of his is not a severe one towards the Master.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Mankind’s oldest hero, the King of Heroes Gilgamesh.
Why does he manifest as a Caster?
Pulling out countless numbers of magic wands from his Noble Phantasm “King’s Treasure” and unleashing various form of attacks; that figure of his certainly appears like that of a magus, but in practice it is far different from a magus who compiles magic reaching towards the mystery of the world. He is also quite different from the author type of Casters that writes of words that composes into poems or novels and fold into a book their very own worlds-----
That figure of his, is so to speak a magus (Caster) in shape only.

There was an opinion left in the Chaldea leftover unofficial records:
“I think that’s probably just his own insinuation. You can call it a sneer. He understands. What the true nature of the magic king who advanced the incineration of Human Order is. …No, not just the magic king. I’m sure he…”

### General Armaments

Taking out the magic wands throughout the space by means of the Noble Phantasm “King’s Treasure” and projecting magic from their points. Long ranged attacks.

Such an extravagant performance and pampering is fine, but sometimes you need to save up!
Know that only my treasure vault holds infinite wealth!
…No, I am not saying it is fine to count on my vault instead.
