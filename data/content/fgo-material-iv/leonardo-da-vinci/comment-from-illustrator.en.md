Although the image of the famous “Mona Lisa” picture is in this state, Mona Lisa’s clothes are like a sailor’s uniform? Let’s give her a miniskirt then! I tried to draw her while taking into account what the director said to me. Her hairstyle is like a modern style’s haircut too. From the standpoint of a weapons developer, I designed a staff that incorporates a pentagram and a stern gauntlet device as her weapons. If I thought of her as a character that was used as a store NPC to some degree, she would become the main playable NPC… By the way, when I was notified that Miss Maaya Sakamoto was the voice actor responsible for her voice, I was so happy, I could die!
