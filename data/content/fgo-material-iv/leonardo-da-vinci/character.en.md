### Personality

Rational, yet placid. However, at things that are very interesting to him/her, da Vinci will jump at it with sparkling eyes. A type of genius that accurately grasps one’s abilities. What he/she can do, and what he/she cannot do. What others can do, and what they cannot do. Basically, because he/she can grasp (calculate) and speculate/observe everything with merely a glance, he/she is always composed. The point is, one should be composed and without being any different than usual, even if one falls into a desperate situation with no escape, and it is no good if one does not be careful. For him/her, the “unexpected” does not simply occur, and even if it does occur, he/she completely assesses with great interest that rare situation. Just because it is said that he/she puts on a face that grasps anything, one should not be restricted, nor is it good, to completely rely on him/her.

The fact that his/her current self is in a young female body is something da Vinci is relatively unaware of. After taking a bath, he/she is the type to prowl around as he/she likes while naked. Regardless of whoever is around.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

After becoming a Servant of the protagonist, da Vinci considers the Master as a “pupil”, and he/she conducts him/herself as a “teacher”. If one would have to say it, they would say he/she is someone who has a familiarity similar to a “teacher who is close in age” to their pupil rather than someone who is a “great teacher”.

### Dialogue Examples

“Call on da Vinci-chan. Now, let us discuss the origin of all creation.”
“I am perfect at all times because I am omnipotent, right? But I guess there is no loss in overdoing it.”
“The incineration of the world must not be done. Therefore, you shall go. I will be close to you too.”
“To be able to truly appreciate my art, you need to be at least a mathematician.”
“Welcome, to the wonderful shop of da Vinci-chan. What do you desire?”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A genius branded as omnipotent. A person of Europe’s 15th~16th Century. A prominent genius who provided a lot of influence on the advancement of civilization and who left his name behind in human history. Although he is recorded to be a peerless handsome young man, a matchless pretty boy————this is in fact his appearance. Regardless, age and gender has no effect before a true genius. Doctrines and fashion may change with the times, but there is merely one truth. Whatever happens, da Vinci-chan is the unrivaled omnipotent one!

Being a great man of wisdom, one can therefore conclude that da Vinci was given the Caster Class, or not. Since during his/her lifetime, he/she was a powerful magus. There is not one thing strange about that. It is something obvious. In addition to science, mathematics, engineering, natural history, music, architecture, sculpture, painting, invention, weapons development, and so forth, he/she also simply possessed the talent for magecraft.

Everything was possible. His/her teacher Verrocchio, Machiavelli and Botticelli of whom are his/her friends, Cesare and the French King Francis I, his/her sponsors and so forth, and the people of the world, all called and praised da Vinci as a natural genius. No, that is incorrect. Everything is the fruit of learning. It is nothing more than a motivation of having studied for the “origin of all creation”. He/She reflects on this quietly as thus.

Certainly, da Vinci is self-aware that there is practically no one who can rival his/her “output”. The sole person that can compare with him/her is more or less Michelangelo, really. But even that is only in the field of the fine arts. In other fields such as science and mathematics, there is no one who surpasses him/her. What is the reason?

It is learning. That is, it is no more than information being “inputted” and accurately grasped, organized and stored in da Vinci’s head as knowledge that can be feasibly referred to at all times. It is not because of a talent bestowed by a god, but from having something that has been produced from nothing. The particulars of so far as “outputting” practical applications/developments is from the basis of the information being “inputted” into his/her head, and it seems to be a mechanism that is sufficiently well-reasoned. Everybody can do it. So why is he/she different?

However, people far and wide called da Vinci omnipotent. The Universal Man (Uomo Universale) with no person that can rival him/her in this world.

“Heh, yes, I see. Omnipotent. All of you are calling me as such.”

In this way, da Vinci was “self-aware” of his/her omnipotence. Knowing the existence of magic that is concealed in Mystery, and also letting his/her talent in that field blossom, already, it is no more than a natural result for him/her. Although his/her body does not even possess the Magic Circuits that were refined by the bloodline according to one’s family lineage, as well as a Magic Crest that was the result of the diligent studies of successive generations of magi, the omnipotent one was going strong. Naturally, regarding the quantity of his/her Magic Circuits that he/she was born with, it is understandably negligible. And yet, its quality is something that should be called outside the standard, while concerning its composition, it is very abnormal. It would mean that his/her omnipotence would also be demonstrated to the magical world.

In spite of a very short training time————da Vinci showed that he/she can manipulate many attributes and had studied many Systems of Magecraft.

“How is it possible? How, does he have so much talent? Is it possible to attain those abnormal Magic Circuits? Perhaps that is, something caused by the blood of a mage from the Age of Gods being left behind in you, expressed as an atavism, is it not?”

Da Vinci informs the inquiries of the magus of the Clock Tower, who became her acquaintance, even though it is not to the extent of calling him a friend, with this:

“Now look, it is because at any rate, I am ‘omnipotent’, right?”

The appearance of da Vinci’s smile is beautiful, as if a goddess has descended to the earth. No doubt, it is because he/she is omnipotent even in regards to beauty.

The third Heroic Spirit summoned by Chaldea. A Servant summoned during a time when the Heroic Spirit Summoning System: FATE was still incomplete. Although it was said that she was about to depart before long as a result of the system’s instability, da Vinci-chan had grown great interest when she comprehended Chaldea’s circumstances, and it is said that she chose to set up residence in Chaldea due to Romani Archaman’s persuasions. Da Vinci-chan constructed a duplicate puppet of herself, and she is suspended in the present era by asserting that as her Master. The thing she just did is the same technique as a certain doll maker somewhere out there.

Da Vinci-chan is, so to speak, a fraud Servant that is suspended in the present era under a “masqueraded contract”. If she acquires a legitimate Master by means of a summoning, she will finally become a Servant “that can get to do battle and go out on the front lines.”

### Others

There exists a statue of David that was constructed by having da Vinci’s adolescent figure as a model.

### Connections with Characters

#### Romani Archaman

A close friend and colleague.
“■■■■■■ with a tendency to ■■■■■■■■■■, is he not? Good grief.”

#### The Magic King

“Good grief. Jeez.”

#### Makiri Zolgen

As a matter of fact, an acquaintance. In their early years, da Vinci is an acquaintance with Makiri, who is an idealist. Although it is not because they are of the same mind, from the way it seems, he/she has recognized him as an excellent magus.

#### Michelangelo

One of da Vinci’s few friends. Although it was only in the fine arts, Michelangelo is a companion who stood equal with da Vinci, possessing a natural genius not inferior to his/her own.

#### Sherlock Holmes

“As for that genius, it is irritating to keep an eye on him since the beginning…”

#### ■■■ ■■■■■

“————Ah, like that sort of thing?”
