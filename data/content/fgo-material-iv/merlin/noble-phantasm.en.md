Garden of Avalon.
Reproducing in the surroundings the tower where Merlin is, even now, being confined.
Flowers bloom all around above the ground, and no matter what kind of darkness or hell it is, the daylight shall shine upon it.
Even if the area that he is allowed to be is but the gaol of mere 10 meters in four direction, and the view that was granted to him is but a the cut off sky in the faraway horizon, that place will eternally be a utopia.

A place where Merlin the Magus of Flower exist is not hell, but none other than a land filled with hope.
