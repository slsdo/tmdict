The feeling of a completely unknown age, and the impression of someone inhuman. For the sake of expressing that, I have him wear a white kimono. There is a sword set all hidden weapon-like in his cane, but the man himself doesn’t really use it as a weapon, but more like playing it around as a toy-like gadget. Is what the image I’m going for. (Taiki)
