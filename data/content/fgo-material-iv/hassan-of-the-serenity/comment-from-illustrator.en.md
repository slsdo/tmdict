I drew her with the feeling that I will make her happy!!! Above all, it is because it seems fun to be at Chaldea. That is good to know, yeah? In relation to her design, I used elder sister Asako of the Hundred Faces as her base. She is similar to an imp â€“ to a black cat. Since she is a child who likes cute things, it is satisfying to be able to put accessories on her and give her cute items as well. (Nakahara)
