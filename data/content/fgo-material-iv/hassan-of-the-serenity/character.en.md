### Personality

As her title shows————a calm female assassin. Obedient, and lacking self-assertion. While she was alive, she was merely a girl who kept on conducting assassinations very mechanically. Even now where she became a Heroic Spirit, that characteristic is not that much different. However, towards people who do not die even if they touched her, she is quietly fanatical and shows devotion to them.

### Attitude towards Master

Would one live if they touch her, or would they die? This is the point she views as the most important. If it is the former, it seems she would dedicate her unconditional loyalty. If it is for the sake of her master, she will do literally anything. For example, even if a genocide comes about, her facial expression does not even change, and she displays obedience without even talking back. Concerning her, who accepted that “everyone will die if they touch me” as a matter of course, the existence of “a master who does not die even if they touch me” becomes her best delight.

### Dialogue Examples

“Everything, everything… as the Lord’s will dictates.”
“Will you live?”
“I guess you will die too.”
“I am sorry. I will kill you.”
“I will serve you, Master.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

An assassin who wears a skull mask. One of the successive Hassan-i Sabbāh who served as the “Old Man of the Mountain” – the founder of the Assassins – it is said that during her lifetime, she was a master of poison who possessed the alias of “Hassan of the Serenity”.

The “Poison Girl” spoken of all over the world and in every era, beginning with India of the BC era, was in reality put together by the Assassins as a tool of assassination. The outward appearance of a beautiful girl is a purely trifling matter. Her body resists every single poison, while simultaneously, it is a lump of poison too. Not only her nails, but even her skin and bodily fluids would act as deadly poison as well, quietly taking away the lives of kings, nobles and military generals in their sleeping quarters————

Although she killed many people, she would also frequently establish a relationship with her assassination target(s), such as being related to them as a lover or a fiancée. That is to say, she kept on repeating the deed where, despite constructing with her own hands a “false happiness” that could not be fulfilled, she would steal that happiness away with her own hands. Gradually, her mind creaked. Her mind was expected to be toughened and tempered thoroughly, seeing that she was made use of and employed as a “Poison Girl” built up by the Assassins, but…

In her last moments, maybe her head was decapitated by a general from a certain army who suspected her behaviour of not even holding hands, maybe she personally exposed her true character as an assassin and begged the general to “Please kill me”————or maybe, she was put to the sword by someone’s hand during the gap when the general incidentally took his eyes off of her.

### Connections with Characters

#### Heracles

“Assuming even in the unlikely event that he died due to my poison on one occasion, if it is with the effect of that hero’s Noble Phantasm, he should be “unable to die a second time to the same poison”————In other words, he truly…?”

#### Arash

“Unexpectedly, a companion who would not die even if he had touched me. Poison is ineffective against him…”
Since the Hassan of the Serenity’s Saint Graph in “Fate/Grand Order” is a “different person” of sorts who possesses absolutely no information about a “particular Holy Grail War”, she cannot completely understand Arash’s motive of why he comes to start a conversation with her as if they are indeed familiar with one another.

#### Paracelsus

A person who cares for her in one way or another. During Valentine’s, Paracelsus was a great help.

Servants who show romantic feelings towards her Master
Towards her rivals, she turns her gaze at them with a clammy atmosphere. Given that she has no assertiveness, she only stares at them in silence.

#### Fergus

A peerless brave warrior of the Celts who, having heard about those who would die from touching her, was far from faltering at those news, and he is in a state of having a curiosity for this person, saying “That person is wonderful you know!” “Really, you say there was no man who could endure her for more than a single night?” “That’s even more wonderful I tell you!”

#### Caster of the Nightless City

Someone to consult with for a Fergus Countermeasure.
