### Shapeshifting (Infiltration Specialization): C

The ability to literally “shapeshift”. It becomes possible for her to change her appearance at will and get close to the target she ought to assassinate. However, she is only able to shapeshift into a figure with a physique that is close to her own’s. As long as this condition has been satisfied, it is also possible for her to shapeshift into a figure exactly like that of a particular individual’s. Even if there are some differences in the desired shapeshifted form, because those have no effect on the condition being satisfied, it is further possible for her to shapeshift into the opposite sex.

### Poisoned Blade: C++

Although the effect is generally the same as the Projectile (Dagger) Skill, it possesses a secondary effect of bestowing onto the target a poison status.

### Dance of Silence: B

The Hassan of the Serenity’s dance scatters poison, weakening the target, and enhancing the success rate of her Noble Phantasm’s application. It is primarily a Skill that functions as a charm-type Skill.

### Door to Paradise: B+

(It is fundamentally not used in “Fate/Grand Order”)
