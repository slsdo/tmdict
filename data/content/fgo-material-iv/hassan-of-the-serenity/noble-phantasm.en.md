Her state of being where she continued to kill everyone who touched her by poison has been transformed into a Noble Phantasm. It results in death to living beings that touched her skin and bodily fluids. If it is armaments that are not Noble Phantasms, then it is also possible to corrode them instantly when they come into contact with her poison. Because she is not able to “adjust” the poison inflicted towards living beings, opponents who touched her will be killed without fail. However, she is able to voluntarily determine whether the armaments she touches would be corroded or not.

Towards Servants, she is not able to “kill them by simply touching them”, but it is more than possible to do things such as causing them pain that slightly weakens their movements. It is also possible to cause damage and bad status effects to them if they happen to come into contact with her mucous membrane, such as through oral means. It is generally death for any being that comes into contact with her mucous membrane for a total of “three times” (in Fate/Grand Order, she attempts to touch her target three consecutive times with a single kiss).

She also possesses a last resort that can be used only once————She bursts and scatters her body in all directions at point-blank range, throwing towards her enemy a massive quantity of her poisonous blood.
