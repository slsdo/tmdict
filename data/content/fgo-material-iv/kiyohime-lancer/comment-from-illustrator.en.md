I also happened to receive a lot of requests with a variety for kimono-styled swimsuits, school swimsuits and bikinis, so I especially did some drastic designs for them based on the modifications of her attire. I conveyed all of it when I drew them. I thought one fellow was being uncertain and was absolutely going to come to me for a retake… I did not understand why I thought that. Nevertheless, given that I was considering her appearance as a battle character as well, I was able to implement the designs, and I was likewise happy. Speaking of such, for her third stage, I had put a parker on her in the beginning. However, because it was plain, I turned it into a kimono. Although, since it was later intended for her chest to be just a little bit bigger, the charm in huge breasts with the nature of cosplay made me put aside the first one… By the way, given that my child is being fed all the 4☆ Fou-kuns, has MAX Skills, Lv.5 Noble Phantasm and is LV 100, she is stronger than the limited teacher.
