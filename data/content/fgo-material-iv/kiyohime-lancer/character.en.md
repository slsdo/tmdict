### Personality

Although the same Kiyohime as always, she is somewhat positive… positive…? She feels like playing towards that orientation. The gloomy part of her state of being has disappeared due to the summer heat.

### Attitude towards Master

Openly like usual, she greets good morning to them first thing in the morning; openly like usual, she sits next to them in the cafeteria; openly like usual, she comes to give them the towel she has if it were the case that they took a shower; openly like usual, she will get into their bed if there is space; to sum it up, openly like usual, she will not come to anyone but the Master.

However, in the situation where there is Berserker Kiyohime as well, this will consist of two Kiyohimes instead.

### Dialogue Examples

“Kiyohime-chan’s great victory! Just kidding…”
“Do… that, I want to do that sort of thing called, holding hands with our fingers interlocked… Ohh… I’m so happy…! That being the case, more than holding hands, this is what they now call husband and wife!”
“Love! I! You!… I’m—Out—Of—Sync!!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

It is no different from the time of her as a Berserker.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

It is no different from the time of her as a Berserker… but, the only thing one should be careful about is that she still exists as a Servant, that she is a Heroic Spirit of the past (and that she is an anti-hero). With how much common sense one has, one even understands that an appearance like her’s is the standard at the waterside; even so, as far as she is concerned, for her own body to be in a swimsuit, it is possible to say that this is surely insane for her… Declaring that to be an easy understanding however, she changed into a swimsuit, and concerning her, given that in itself is the result of her having mustered her courage, one should give praise for her openheartedness, please.

### General Armaments

A naginata (it is something part of a maiden’s taste, somehow)

### Connections with Characters

#### Kiyohime (Berserker)

If we multiply as we are, that being the case, won’t this complete an absolute encirclement that will not let Master~ get away?
Kiyohime is suspicious.

#### All of the Cú Chulainns

I’m thinking of making him the midway target.

#### All of the Artorias

I’m thinking of making her the final target.
