### Personality

Introvert, active, and confident.
Normally Enkidu simply loiter around just like a flower, but should Enkidu begin to move, Enkidu becomes an dreadful, active monster without delay, without mercy, & without hesitation.

For Enkidu, humans are too a living being upon this earth, and thus a target of affection. However, because humans distance themselves from nature due to their intelligence, their value as protection target is low.

With that said, Enkidu at the basis has a large curiosity (intellectual desire), and thus enjoys conversations with humans.

If the target has a likable personality (a totalitarian brimming with benevolence, yet thinks of himself first and foremost), Enkidu will display respect and affection as well as admiration from the heart and will delightfully support him as a friend.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Enkidu persists in regards of behavior towards humans.
In other words, to walk together with them and for Enkidu’s self to be made use as a weapon.
Even as Enkidu and the Master spend time together through day over day, Enkidu’s course of action, speech, and conduct would not change no matter what.
Through the chance meeting with Gilgamesh, Enkidu’s self had been redefined; the awareness of that is secure and unwavering, just like as a weapon or a machine, unending in preserving its invariance.
Even with a soul, Enkidu’s differs with that of a human.

And yet, even so…
If one discovers a change in the midst of mortal struggle surrounding the Human Order-----it would instead be of existing besides the Master.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Lancer. Enkidu.
I invoke by your hail.
May you use me freely and without mercy, Master.”
“It is pleasant. Competing abilities with each other, I mean.”
“Good job. Well sharpened, everybody.”{{n1}}

### Character Image

A serene expression. A “will-bearing Noble Phantasm” that possesses severe battle prowess, unimaginable to have come from such a gentle bearing.
Said by King of Heroes Gilgamesh as the strongest, the chains that binds heaven and earth.
A puppet made by the hands of the gods; the offshoot (bunshin) of earth itself that unify and harmonize with nature.

Enkidu, the sole friend of the King of Heroes that had ventured many times with him. The sorrowful weapon that, upon gaining a heart, had returned to the earth as a puppet.

<>

One of the oldest heroes, spoken of in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
A weapon created by the gods.
Originally made by the gods as a “clayworks that changes to anything”.
Enkidu changes shapes freely at will depending on the circumstances.
In his body was equal to the gods whole body of ichor{{n2}}.
However, Enkidu did not possess the mind and sentiment of a human; practically no different from a mere beast.

After appearing in the world, Enkidu met a lone sacred prostitute and learned many knowledge from her. Before long, Enkidu had then chosen to take the form of a human (as a fundamental form).
The form that esteemed and imitated that of the divine prostitute.

Enkidu’s strength is roughly equal to that of King of Heroes Gilgamesh at his golden age.
In Enkidu’s fight with Gilgamesh, spoken of in the Epic, Enkidu had demonstrated an ability equal to that and approved by the sole strongest hero within the human history.

Gilgamesh, superior and isolated, for the first time ever had discovered a friend, and Enkidu too, had recognized Gilgamesh as peerless friend.

After the fight within the city of Uruk, Gilgamesh and Enkidu who had befriended each other went to many adventures, and Enkidu would eventually lose life after the fight against the Divine Bull Gugalanna.
