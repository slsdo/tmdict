### Transfiguration: A

A unique skill that divides attribute value from the constant composite value depending on the circumstances. A high rank in this Skill results in a high composite value.
At times STR is made to A rank, at times CON is made to A rank.
However, because the limit of parameter configuration is already decided, turning all numerical value into A cannot be done.
Enkidu possesses attribute value of 30, expending the value of [A: 7] [B: 6] [C: 5] [D: 4] [E: 3] for each parameter.

### Presence Detection: A{{n1}}

The ability to detect presence of the highest rank.
It is possible to detect far away presence by communicating with the earth.

### Perfect Form: A

Reconstruction to original shape by utilizing magic energy of the earth.
Enkidu’s body, which was made using clay from the age of the gods, will never crumble as long as there is a supply of magic energy from the earth.
A completely unprecedented powerful reconstruction and regeneration ability.
However, the soul is a different matter.
