Enkidu is a character whose visual was shown the first time in Fate/strange Fake. Was so beautiful in the main works. The perfectly and overly otherworldly beauty is the emphasis, and such a high hurdle makes me go “haha man the one drawing this would have a real hard time” as I escape from reality. Anyway I went searching for the meaning of beauty in the dictionary and ended up straying off course, but even now you can still say I am still at lost.

Regarding the ascension, the image is one untouched by the civilization that had separated itself from the basis of the god; it was quite a trouble. Even if I give him a bunch of ornaments, what would that even be for Enkidu who lives best in the forests, those kinds of indispensable stuffs keeps on adding up in my mind, even stuffs such as the Enkidu as a clay doll before gaining intelligence. Would the direction for Enkidu who manifested with the form of a human as a Lancer be subtly different, or would changing the appearance made Enkidu changes personality too. The second ascension’s ambience went through just the same. But I also think that maybe I did think too much about it.

And then, I heard about Kingu, who makes an appearance in the 7th chapter, and about Kingu’s strong, human-like emotion. From there I experimented a bit with Enkidu’s third ascension; the eyes must be easily visibly different from Kingu, with the mood like his awareness is far away in the distance. For the sake of being even more of a weapon… (Morii Shizuki)
