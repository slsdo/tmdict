It came up in previous discussions where the white armor version of Zero Lancelot takes off his helmet and shows us his long hair during second ascension; when he gets to that form I wanted to draw a rough design, but then I was told to do him “with a feeling of a yankee who repents and cut off his hair”. So I had the various design, his armor, and his hair taken out, and the result settled down to his current form. Please stay as a father who will never raise his head to his daughter. (Shimadrill)
