### Personality

He loves justice, respects woman, and detests evil. He is fond of righteous path, unforgiving towards cowardly behavior, and always behaves in pride---------the perfect existence that embodied the way of the knights.
However, that pure nobility and too serious of a dignity of his easily invites misunderstanding and envy.
Heroes possess both sides of light and shadow aspects within them, but Lancelot can be said to consist only of the side of light.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As he is a noble and upright knight, as a Servant he can be said to be the exactly ideal existence. However, he never personally involves himself deeply in regards of servant-master relationship. Therefore, one can feel annoyance towards his behavior that serves while drawing a line.

### Historical Image · Character Image

In the legend of King Arthur, he is the greatest and most commended knight within the Round Table.
His competency with surpass even King Arthur himself, and there was even his feat of one-on-one fight against Gawain, who demonstrates threefold of power during daylight, where Lancelot continuously fought for several hours.
Competent and popular, he is one of the most preeminent figure of the Round Table.

However, his immoral love with Guinevere, King Arthur’s queen, the secret of King Arthur’s birth, and him having no choice but to turn his sword against those he once deemed friends; all manners of tragic fate had brought doom upon him.

### Dialogue Examples

“Of the Round Table, assault knight Lancelot.
In the name of the king, I shall restraint the enemy.
Resist, and I shall show no mercy.
You may submit, or you may oppose-----do as your conviction demands you.”
“I simply wish, for my king to judge the lawbreaker that I am.
If I may have one wish towards the Holy Grail, that that is my wish.”
“Nay….
It simply that I have spotted a beautiful lady in far in the distance, and thus I promptly…”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The type of Lancelot that is perhaps closest to how he was during his life. An ideal knight. To say that he is the strongest knight among the Round Table would be no sophistication.
He is able to hold conversation with Gawain, Tristan, or Bedivere no differently than when he was alive, but to his regret, when it comes to Mordred, he saw her bare face for the first time and ended up hesitating to talk to her.

It’s the similar situation in relation with Mashu Kyrielight, but with her, it’s better to say that he ended up gazing affectionately towards the spirit foundation existing deep within her.

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria

’Tis an honor.
This time, I am not mistaken; this be the place I shall offer my sword.

#### Mashu

We should have neither bond nor a connection, yet I feel one as such.
I see. It do seem that he had done his duty magnificently.
For now, I shall simply, quietly take pride in it.

#### Gawain

Naturally, an intimate friend of mine.
I am truly glad for another chance to once again fight side by side with him…. However. While that may be the case. No matter how many times we do battle, I shall certainly be the one to emerge victorious. Indeed.

#### Tristan

…Very well, Sir Tristan! Let us put that matter for another place!
In the dining room and the hallways, let us speak nothing but heroic tales!

#### Mordred

Wait, wait.
I… I am putting my thoughts in order, so…
