Arondight Overload.{{n1}}
Bestowing an overload to the Unfading Light of the Lake, then unleashing the loaded magic energy in the sword’s blade.
Transforming it as an attack. Due to the usage method being different from how it is originally, it puts intense burden on Lancelot’s body.
In FateGO it is used against a single enemy, but originally it is a Noble Phantasm used against enemy’s troop.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Lines from ingame menu has this:
本来であれば光の斬撃となる魔力をあえて放出せず、対象を斬りつけた際に解放する剣技に寄った 宝具。
膨大な魔力は切断面から溢れ、その青い光はまさに湖のようだと称された。
So with Arondight Overload having max 50 range and 500 target, practically identical with Balmung sword beam, presumably the original use is still bestowing an overloading on Arondight but doesnt intentionally reining it in, which is the anti-army part, while the anti-unit part is releasing it when the slash hits the target)
