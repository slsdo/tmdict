Wu Xing Shan – Shijia Rulai Zhang.
Borrows a small portion of the power of Shakyamuni, who serves as the venerable Buddha and as her teacher (of a previous existence) in the heavens. The “edge of the world” that Sun Wukong once reached————that is, the very palm of a gigantic Shakyamuni, falls down from the skies and chastises the antagonists that shows contempt for Buddhism. An Anti-Army~Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm. The heel of the Enlightened One’s palm.

Jibie – Zhantan Gongde.
It is “Xuanzang Sanzang as a kind of Buddha in the future” as prophesized in the final stage of “Journey to the West”; in other words, a Noble Phantasm derived from the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit. The whole body of Xuanzang is wrapped in an aureole, and she temporarily attains a limited Buddha Mode. She can repel most attacks in this mode, and although her offensive power is not even that much, she has high resilience by further being able to repel mental interferences and push aside abnormal status attacks in addition to keeping up a large recovery ability continuously around her own position. However, after using this, her entire Saint Graph will be destroyed and Xuanzang will disappear.
