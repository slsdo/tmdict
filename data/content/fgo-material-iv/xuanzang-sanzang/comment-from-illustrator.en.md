Concerning the feminization of Xuanzang Sanzang, there is a drama masterpiece where Xuanzang was performed by Miss Natsume Masako, so it was difficult producing a character image and it resulted in us arguing back and forth, making me think up of 3 or 4 draft plans. Although there are some divine articles as well as even more young Chinese characters, the finish is as you see, and it was also when I drew this that I at last understood why this pattern was chosen when playing the scenario. Although I aimed to draw a character that wanted to be preaching, I certainly did not know that she would be preaching (physically). (Okazaki Takeshi)
