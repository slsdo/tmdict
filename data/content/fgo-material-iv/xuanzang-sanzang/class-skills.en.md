### Territory Creation: A+

Creates a “Workshop” that is an advantageous position to oneself as a magus. Because she possesses Rank A in this, it is possible to create a “Temple”, which is superior to a “Workshop”.

(Strictly speaking, because the orientation of her school of magecraft is different, the territory created by Xuanzang Sanzang is not designated as a “Workshop”. Also, it excels in timeliness in regards to its creation, so the practicability of creating a territory on the spot = a powerful Bounded Field.)

### Item Creation: —

Xuanzang Sanzang does not own an Item Creation Skill.

### Divinity: D

Xuanzang Sanzang, who is destined to eventually reach the Buddahood of the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit, is endowed with the Divinity Skill.
