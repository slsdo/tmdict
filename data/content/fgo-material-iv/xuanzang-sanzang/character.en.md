### Personality

A bundle of curiosity. Xuanzang loves adventure! A figure brimming with the spirit of inquiry towards the unknown with an unwavering self-confidence. Although gracefully silent as a beautiful and faithful monk, her spirit overflowing with a desire to challenge herself is decorating her facial expressions, and it truly does not conceal her nature of having an unyielding spirit. “As long as there are the chirpings of the adorable songbirds that signals the morning’s rise and the divine protection, compassion and guidance of the honorable Buddha, my journey won’t be hindered by anybody and everybody!”

Xuanzang is confident in herself————or so it looks like with an open glance of her. As a matter of fact, the reason she is confident is in regards to the sacred Buddhism religion, so she does not believe even the slightest in her very own self as such a magnificient person. She is also not self-aware of herself as a talented student. Although she remembers only a faint bit concerning her experience of being kicked out of the heavens for having deceived Master Tathagata in the spur of the moment in the heavens, the root of her is humble given that it is permeated with the depths of her memories.

Xuanzang appears strict, but her nature is gentle. Especially to the weak, she is earnestly kind, and if a person is troubled, she will not forsake them. Because she is not thoughtless, she is extremely positive thinking oriented since she has a belief that is unshakable, called “being rewarded for persevering three times the hardship.” Taking into consideration that she is never mistaken regarding the “Way of Man”, she often becomes lost during her travels. And because she gets lonely when she becomes lost, she cries before long.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Xuanzang recognizes her Master as a “disciple”. Frankly, she is strict to her companion that she deemed as a “disciple”. Although, given that she expects a growth from them that progresses down the tough path of a “Buddhist disciple” sufficient to the point that they will receive the same reward like other Buddhist disciples, when it comes to the crunch, she will be gentle either way. A Miss Tsundere Master.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m Xuanzang Sanzang! I came into this world so I can guide you to the honorable Buddha. Ummm, my Class is Caster!”
“You have the honorable Buddha’s divine protection. Everything’s certainly alright!”
“Evvverything is as Buddha has foreseen!”
“Good thing. Listen. I’m not mistaken. When I make a mistake, it’s because I’m a moron who can’t be helped. But the honorable Buddha, he doesn’t make mistakes. Because weak people, foolish people, people who changed their ways, they equally all guide us the way.”
“… Uuu, if only Wukong was here, something like this…”
“Gone…”{{n1}}

### Character Image

A Buddhist priest of the Tang Dynasty in 7th Century AD. Travelling through the Silk Road in search of the original Buddhist scriptures, it resulted in Xuanzang heading to India from Central Asia, before bringing back to China from there sutras amounting up to 657 items and becoming the founder of the Chinese Faxiang Buddhist sect.

Xuanzang is also known as a key character in the Chinese novel “Journey to the West”. Receiving a command from Guanyin, this beautiful monk, while riding Bai Long (Yulong) – the son of the Dragon King of the West Sea that transformed into a white horse – had Qitiang Dasheng (Great Sage Equal to Heaven) Sun Wukong (Sun Xingzhe), Tianpeng Yuanshuai (Marshal Canopy) Zhu Bajie (Zhu Wuneng) and Juanlian Dajiang (Curtain-Lifting General) Sha Wujing (Sha Heshang) as her disciples, and she headed for India without ever losing heart in the face of the many monsters obstructing her path.

In “Journey to the West”, it is said that Xuanzang lived in the heavens originally as Jin Chanzi (Golden Cicada), a disciple of Shakyamuni, but she fell into secular life because of a “certain incident” being the impetus. In other words, Xuanzang Sanzang is the reincarnation of Jin Chanzi. (It is because of this that the Demon King and the monsters are enticed by and tried to eat Xuanzang’s flesh again and again during the story of “Journey to the West”. If one eats Xuanzang, one gets to acquire a tremendous power associated with eternal youth.)

Xuanzang Sanzang had a Prophecy of Future Enlightenment and became the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit, so she is originally not a being that can respond to a person’s summoning, even with the one done by Chaldea’s system. Materializing and being successfully summoned at this time is only because of these exceptional circumstances. That alone, the phenomenon called the Incineration of the Human Order, must be perceived as an extremely serious threat.

### General Armaments

She makes use of mainly bare-handed techniques that appears to be taught by her teacher in the heavens. Also, she uses the weapons and techniques associated with Sun Wukong and her disciples, although Xuanzang herself is not aware of this situation. Dr. Roman expressed jokingly that it may not be known that the fragmented thoughts of her disciples’ worries for their great master lurks within her Saint Graph.
