### Personality

A blond haired girl with the scarlet blood eyes.
An oni with inhuman appearance, born in this world.
In her childhood she was strictly disclipined by her mother, who descended from a noble bloodline, to learn how to hold pride as an oni.
Then again, seen from the perspective of a third party, one cannot really see that oni mama (母鬼)’s training as something filled with love. Though it’s pretty close to harassment.

To summarize it, she is self aware of her responsibility as the child of her noble mother, to have the last of onis, eradicated by humans, act as a group.
On order to do that, Ibaraki established a standard rule, and any of the onis that break said rules, she would spank with iron staff. (Of course, Shuten is the sole exception.)
She is a demon, so from the human viewpoints she is unmistakably a wicked beast. But at her root, she is a belle who respects order and ponders over the fate of her brethren.

While her appearance exudes innocence, that very state of being is that of an oni. Hurting humans, devouring humans, loving blood.
However, she does not have much disposition in the way of selfishly enjoying slaughter and massacre. Her nature is not that of an oni that bring disorder to the world; in the end, she devours humans as an oni, as a living being. One can say that she is close to that of a wild animal.
For example, even if she appears to be fascinated with sweets, her nature is indeed not that of a young human girl. Depending on the circumstances, she just might devour even the human who enticed her with sweets.
Never ever take a lion for a cat.
Never. Ever. Yet…
If one actually succeeds on feeding her, she just might display a lovely smile.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Her wish upon the Holy Grail is “to see the smiling face of Shuten.”
The smile of her stepsibling, one without worry, without sorrow, without hesitation, is the source of Ibaraki’s everything.
Be it the famed in Kyoto Abe no Seimei, or Minamoto no Raikou, or her powerful Four Heavenly Kings. Ibaraki is unperturbed in her opposition against all of them, wishing only for that smile even until her death.

### Dialogue Examples

“My name be Ibaraki Douji. Ringleader of the onis from Mount Ooe.”
“I am oni, and you are human. Fear me.”
“Understand this; an oni left in boredom is the most dangerous of them all.”
“I dislike poisoned drinks. Too, the cowardly warriors who used of such things in their hunts for oni.”
“So you toppled down an oni…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

An oni that appeared in Kyoto during the Heian Era, performing all manners of atrocity.
It is said that Ibaraki Douji is the subordinate of Shuten Douji that inhabits the Mount of Ooe, who crossed swords with Watanabe no Tsuna of the Four Heavenly Kings during Minamoto no Raikou and the Four Heavenly Kings’ “Mount Ooe’s oni extermination”.
Ibaraki Douji appeared as a “beautiful woman” during the anecdote of Rashoumon.

The sole survivor of Mount Ooe’s onis. At Rashoumon (or perhaps at the bridge of Ichijo Modoribashi) Ibaraki Douji assaulted Watanabe no Tsuna, who severed Ibaraki Douji’s hand . It was then was taken as a spoil of war temporarily, but Ibaraki Douji managed to take it back and then disappeared somewhere.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In this work, Ibaraki Douji is not the subordinate of Shuten Douji, but the ringleader of the onis of Mount Ooe instead.

Ibuki Douji, who was born of the great god of Ibuki that is the Yamata no Orochi and a human. In other words, Shuten Douji. Indeed, it was only appropriate for the Abe no Seimei, the authority of ancient Kyoto, to pay attention to such a being. However, the one who in reality lead over the onis of Mount Ooe is no other than Ibaraki Douji.
The strong but excessively pleasure-seeking Shuten had not a even a bit of interest of leading over the swarm of onis. As far as she is concerned, the only one who could lead the bunch of onis being drawn by Shuten’s position as the “"master who controls the mouintain” is her equal, Ibaraki Douji, and no other.

Ibaraki Douji had been the one who built a solemnly majestic palace in Mount Ooe. She had loved her stepsibling, the one brought up together with her, the pleasure seeking Shuten Douji. She had led the thousand strong mass of oni, and had performed many atrocities in ancient Kyoto. The savage demon who had led the people to fall into fear and dread.

Her status as an oni is high ranked; a sharp-witted fierce commander whose strong point is guerilla warfare.
If you think about it, together with her army of onis, she should have crushed any kind of human’s strength, even it it is Raikou and the Four Heavenly Kings. (Or at least that’s what she thought.)

The one thing that tore down Ibaraki Douji’s stronghold, is no other than the pleasure of Shuten Douji, her stepsibling who she should love more than anything.
For the sake of speaking with Sakata Kintoki, she had guided Raikou and the Four Heavenly Kings, and even while knowing it was poison, she had drank the Shinpenkidoku (Providential Oni Poison). It was the height of pleasure for Shuten Douji.
And Ibaraki Douji failed to stop her.

### General Armaments

A slash by means of a large war sword.
The kotsutou (bone blade). Not made by metal, but thoroughly tempered using the bones of oni kin, a first rate sword with ominous aura wafting around it.
Unsigned.

### Connections with Characters

#### Shuten Douji

Her beloved stepsibling.
She feels happiness when Shuten is besides her, but on the other hand, Ibaraki does understand that it was being with Shuten that brought ruin to Mount Ooe. She had abandoned her oni subordinates for her love for Shuten, completely running counter to her mother’s precept.
Due to that, Ibaraki Douji conceals her feelings of friendship and affection for Shuten Douji. (Or so she thought anyway.)

#### Minamoto no Raikou

Hate her. Just once, I want to kill her just once, but there’s just no way against that one.

#### Minamoto on the whole

Hate them. I will kill them all if they dare show their face.

#### Sakata Kintoki (Berserker)

Hate him. Even killing him twice won’t be enough. If you go to the point of almost killing someone, it would be as if you’ve already committed the act anyway, no? (一度は殺す手前までいったら、一度は殺しているようなものだろう。not really sure on this one, somebody help?)

#### Sakata Kintoki (Rider)

Hate him. But at least his steel horse is not half bad.
I heard that it is a dreadful steel bear known as the GOLDEN HUGE BEAR mk.I. With that kind of name of course I will feel curious.

#### Abe no Seimei

Hate him. Even killing him thrice won’t be enough.

#### Watanabe no Tsuna

Hatehatehatehatehatekillkillkillkillburnkillshredk illeatkill.
But, occasionally I would like to exchange words instead of swords. Raging intention to kill and sheer curiosity. I am a bit bewildered that two such conflicting thoughts resides within me, but why… when telling Shuten this, she smiles and whispered “Finally Ibaraki too acts prim and demon-like”. Why….?

#### Tamamo no Mae

Hard to deal. One of the Great Monster, yet blending in within the human world. Just reminisching about it is scary enough already. (thanks mizukume)

#### Robin Hood

Sage of the forest. He was ostracized out by his village. Maybe I shall keep this forest dwelling sage company.
