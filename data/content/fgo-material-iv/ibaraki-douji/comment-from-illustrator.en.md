Ibaraki Douji’s start is keeping her cuteness as much as I can while still keeping her unique part as an oni, I think… The beginning concept was a deformed sort of gross-but-cute. Eventually what’s left is only her hands and feet, her nonexistent eyebrow, and her long horns; but in the initial concept she even doesn’t have exactly 5 fingers. Her other body parts were finetuned and then it reaches her current concept. The complete version is her second form, and from there I made it simpler for her first form and add stuffs in for her last one. It was such a showy and luxurious design, so I had lots of fun drawing her. (Hidari)
