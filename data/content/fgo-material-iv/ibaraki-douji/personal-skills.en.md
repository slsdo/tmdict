### Oni Kin Demon: A

A skill representing the demonic nature and the superpower of an oni.
Only pure and mixed-blood oni kin can acquire this skill.
It is a composite skill combining skills such as Innate Demon, Monstrous Strength, Charisma, Magic Energy Burst, but in this work the effect is adjusted.
In the case of Ibaraki Douji, her Magic Energy Burst becomes “flame”.
One blow from and oni combining a high rank STR, rank A Monstrous Strength, and rank A Magic Energy Burst would result in an astounding amount of destructive force, devastating the target.

### Disengage: A

The ability to withdraw from battle.
Returning disadvantageous battle to its initial state.
From an anecdote where she managed to splendidly wtihdrew from battle when Watanabe fought her and had her hand severed with his famed sword “Higekiri”.

### Shapeshift: A

Free transformation of her form.
It’s possible for her to shapeshift to other form such as a child or even giant.
Due to her basic physique frame no longer growing anymore, Ibaraki Douji uses this skill to the extreme, zealously striving everyday to become the great oni anyone and everyone would fear.
