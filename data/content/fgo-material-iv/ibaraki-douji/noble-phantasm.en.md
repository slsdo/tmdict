Her right hand, severed by one of Minamoto no Raikou’s Four Heavenly Kings, Watanabe no Tsuna. Normally it is properly attached, but she can freely detach and manipulate it, making it fluttering about in the sky or even having it acs as an offensive weapon. Her fist, clad in the dreadful, sweltering heat of the oni kin enlarge in size, just like that of a great oni. Reminiscent of an Onibi, it then revolves around the enemies’ line and destroys them.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Specialization of the Sougenbi for anti-unit usage in battle.
Ten consecutive attack of scorching heat that completely, thoroughly crushes and burns up to 3 attack targets.
Scorching the enemy to cinders, leaving only their bones charred to black coals.
Ibaraki herself speak of it passionately, “This truly is the bone extrication technique of Hazan! (破山抜骨, hazan pakkotsu)” but the handed down bone extrication part is Shuten’s influence.
(In FateGO, it is fundamentally not being used.)

(flame and grudge can be read the same, “en”, which is why both of her NPs are Engi. Strictly speaking it shouldve been Great Rising Resentment of Rashoumon annd Great Rising Flame of Mount Ooe but thats too mouthful for my taste. Also, Sougenbi (叢原火, lit flames of the plains) is an Onibi or a type of one (lit flame oni, something like will o wisp oni version) from Kyoto, and what Ibaraki said during her NP line. Also, the counting parts on Ibaraki’s second NP is done in a shinto, ritualistic way in Japanese)
