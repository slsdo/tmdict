### Personality

Extolled as the “Knight of the Sun”, he is a very serious character; but not overbearingly so. That attitude of his is truly the definition of integrity and uprightness. A handsome man with a tall body and tenacious body, wearing a calm and lenient mask. With a refreshing expression, he refrains on making light of his enemy or insulting them. Even if his enemy is lacking in capacity, Gawain will surmise that fighting spirit and resolution, behave as decorum demand him and face his enemy.
However, due to reasons that will be mentioned later, he deliberately checks in and suppresses his own personal feeling. Due to that, his natural integrity and uprightness is emphasized much more strongly. To put it in a good way, he is inflexible; to put it badly, he becomes the kind of person who cannot read the mood.
Known as a loyal knight, and as he is summoned as a Servant he still holds his regret of being unable to help the king. His loyalty towards the king is as that of an iron, his faith unshakable; he strongly wish to simply swing of his sword once more for the sake of the king.

One can say it is a sort of blind devotion; during the Holy Grail War of the moon, Nero (Saber) asked this of him: “Then say you are ordered to decapitate a friend; will you simply do so?”
To that, he answered thus: “But of course. If it be the king’s desire, then I shall involve myself even with the most disgraceful of conducts. That is what it means to put oneself as a sword. The king is never mistaken; were there any mistakes, then I should think that those are not of the king, but of a friend’s. One who had been sentenced to death.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

During his life, he had divided apart Britain from his personal grudge. Due to that regret, he now places selfless devotion as first and foremost. One can say that he is the most ideal Servant for a Master.
He is truly a Servant embodying a knight serving his king. However, should he judge the Master as someone unworthy as a king, hit is unknown whether or not the Master can accept his loyalty to its fullest. It’s best if they are both compatible with each other; one can say that he is a Servant hard to handle otherwise.

Due to making devotion towards his king his absolute mission, he will dedicate himself as the sword of his Master, whom he had approved as his king; he will never put himself out as the Master is conversing, and he himself will speak only as a proxy of his Master. Such is the attitude he takes, one that understands his stand point as a knight and retainer.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am Gawain, your servant. I do hope we can acquaint each other well hereafter. I pray that I am worthy of you, my lord.”
(どうか、我が主の良き好敵手であらんことを。lit. i pray that (i) become worthy rival? somebody should double check)
“By your will. My sword is the embodiment of the sun itself. Under the king’s order shall I burn to cinders everything in this world.”
“This sword is the vessel that reflects the sun itself. With one swing of the holy sword of the planet…… Excalibur Galatine!”
“The night shall be banished in front of this radiance, and emptiness shall be swept away by this holy sword of the planet! Excalibur Galatine!”
“Meals prefers quantity over quality, no? A large heaping of breads, potatoes, and vinegar. Add some ale to that, and I am satisfied plenty enough. Of course, one must not forget the vegetables. Simple carrots are enough. The king and the others had once eaten such meals without even a single complaints.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

In the legend of King Arthur, he makes an appearance as a Knight of the Round Table, one who is equal or superior to “Lancelot of the Lake”.
The eldest son of King Lot of Orkney. He was a relative of Arthur, and there had even been an event where he was entrusted with the holy sword Excalibur.
He is known as a noble one, with various military exploits extolled in numerous tales. If he had even a single weak point, that would be his strong love towards his blood relatives. It started with King Pellinore, who had shoot down Gawain’s father in battle; he then began to oppose one by one every knight who had injured any of his relatives, sometimes even ended up murdering them.
When Lancelot took Queen Guinevere and ran away to Gallia, he had refused King Arthur’s pardon for Lancelot and had brought about war with him, for Lancelot had killed Gawain’s sibling as he absconded.
While carrying the serious wound left from his one-on-one fight against Lancelot, Gawain had fought the army of Mordred, who had raised a rebellion. In the verge of his death, he persuaded the king to request reinforcement to Lancelot, then passed away. All the while deeply regretting his personal grudge that had brought about the fracturing of the Knights of the Round Table…

### Role in Past Works

He appeared in Fate/EXTRA. He deeply regretted that he had been unable to throw away his hatred towards Lancelot during his live which had brought about the death of King Arthur.
Gawain. With the absolute mission to devote himself completely in aiding his king, Gawain then served selflessly under the young Master he had approved to be of a king’s calibre, one who possesses sacredness as a king as he was born.
However, he then understood that the one thing his Master lacked to be a true king is “defeat”; Gawain then had chosen to continue on being his Master’s sword with all of his might, until such time comes.
