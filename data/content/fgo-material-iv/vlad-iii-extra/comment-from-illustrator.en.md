I thought of him as a bit of a troublesome old man because Lun Lu isn’t around in FGO, and I drew him with a straight, low angle composition so as to be more intense and more troubling compared in EXTRA. But then when he was implemented and raise, I feel like a lot of super cute aspect is seen, and I genuinely thought that it would’ve been better if I drew him with a much tender expression.
