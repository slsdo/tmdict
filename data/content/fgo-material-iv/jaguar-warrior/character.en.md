### Personality

Do you like a Jaguar elder sister? Whether you like her or not, Jaguar is Jaguar. There is no escape.

A friendly character, one who is bright and without discrimination. It likely seems to be a strong reflection of the possessed human’s personality. Once Jaguar Man’s mind becomes completely set on something, the target will be certainly teased with for weeks. That means there is no escape.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The Jaguar Warrior is proud. One should not expect to earn her trust in a brief period of time, even if one is called her Master. However, if Jaguar Man notices one’s daily endeavours, what one will be able to receive is a Jaguar Stamp, stamped with her paw. If one collects a lot of stamps, someday, it will probably appear to result in one being able to receive an acknowledgement of being her close friend. One cannot help doing their best in order to aim for being her Jaguar-mate (Tezcatlipoca-mate).

### Dialogue Examples

“The Jaguar Warrior has arrived at this place! I am no tiger, so regarding that point, you better get that through your head!”
“Offer up a sacrifice to the cat. Reconcile with the cat.”
“Nyah!”
“The Jaguar knows all.”
“Now. Jaguar Stamps, how many have you accumeowulated?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

One of the olden Divine Spirits transmitted in Central and South America. The Jaguar, namely, a symbol of “war” and “death”, is an existence revered for a long time in the Central and South American civilizations of all eras, and it is said that, in the bygone days, it would often show its form to the world. In the Olmec Civilization of the Preclassic period, the Jaguar deity was a being possessing the mixed-blood of a jaguar and a human being and was deified in the shape of a “Jaguar-Human (Jaguar Man/Werejaguar)” figure and the like.

In Central and South American mythologies, the Jaguar is frequently spoken of as a spiritual existence called a Nagual, a shadow and a supernatural Guardian Spirit. It is said that Tezcatlipoca, one of the chief gods worshipped in Aztec Civilization, is also endowed with a Nagual, and this Nagual is a fearsome Jaguar Nagual.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In “Fate/Grand Order”, while Jaguar Man owns a nature as a Divine Spirit of old, it is simultaneously syncretizing its aspects as a Nagual of Tezcatlipoca, drawing them from its own genealogy.

Heroic Spirit possession. The Jaguar Nagual achieved its materialization as a bunrei, done by possessing a particular human as its vessel. From time immemorial, it is said that humans who obtained the Nagual of a Jaguar were endowed with supernatural powers. The Nagual tales are narrated even in the modern times. Furthermore, concerning the criteria for possession, among the humans that has a tie to the Holy Grail, the person who carries the fate of the wildness and the wildest force is elected.

It is unknown why the Jaguar attempted to materialize in this world. Maybe it came along while being attracted to Quetzalcoatl, or maybe it came along while in a playful mood. Perhaps it stole a march on Tezcatlipoca when he was about to appear, and so on; the curiosity about this matter is endless.

Because the Jaguar belongs to the lower grade among the Divine Spirit Servants, its selling point is that it does not cost a lot to cover in terms of magical energy.

No matter how one looks at it, the personality of the possessed body is composed of the main host, but that should not be pointed out.

### General Armaments

A frightening club. Used for close-range attacks.

### Others

The alignment belongs to Jaguar Man, not the possessed human. The gender belongs to the possessed human.

The possessed human is endowed with an astounding Luck rank, but it was ranked down for some reason at the time of possession.
