It is said that there was no choice but to have that Jaguar Man get on a motorcycle! What do I do! And it is this outcome that troubled my mind. Is it ok for me to make a completely different pose for her final Ascension stage!? I am thankful! And one thing! I am happy that it can be accepted and used. There was certainly a great pressure on me to draw her. (Aotsuki Takao)
