The base is the visual that came out last in Fate/stay night’s Saber route. The ribbon tie and the coattail was added and arranged from the image of a butler. The cloth on his right shoulder was attached originally for hiding his lost arm, as he doesnt have a silver arm in the beginning. But i was happy that it was used nicely in the CM and Stage version all fluttering! (Tenkū Sphere)
