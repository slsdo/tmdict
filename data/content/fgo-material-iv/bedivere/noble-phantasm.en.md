### Switch On · Argetlam: Take the Sword, Silver Arm

Switch On・Argetlam.
A silver arm given by the magus Merlin to compensate for having only one arm.
Not the “silver arm” divine forged armament that was utilized by the Celtic war god Nuadha, but a transient Noble Phantasm which existence was backed by granting it the same name with the one in the myth. Its true identity is the “unreturned holy sword” existing only in a “if” history-----
(The one used by Bedivere summoned in Chaldea is not the holy sword itself, but an imaginary holy sword.)

A continuously active type of Noble Phantasm. Usually his output is that of an average human, but when performing activation for combat, the STR, CON, and AGI parameter rises, and he gained bonus for his sword attack. (His written status already takes parameter rise into account)

In FateGO, it is continously being activated during battle.

Dead End・Argetlam.
A slash special move utilizing the silver arm that concealed a colossal amount of magic energy.
Only possible to be activated during the time of Switch On・Argetlam’s combat activation.
A flashing anti-unit, anti-army annihilation attack that blazes on the enemy line by means of “hand swing”.
