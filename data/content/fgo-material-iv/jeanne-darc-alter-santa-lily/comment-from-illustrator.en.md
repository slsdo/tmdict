Actually originally the design is for Jeanne Alter Santa, and I had already finished up to rough design and all, but then Nasu said “Hmm, we need more twist.” I took that into mind and wandered off on reworking her, and thus she is born.
Personally, I think that Amakusa being her teacher is her greatest charm (moe?) point. Isn’t this like, how the protagonist’s old rival takes care of the protagonist’s child and like, teachs her everything he knows sort of development!? (Takeuchi Takashi)
