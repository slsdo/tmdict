La Grace Fille Noel.
An anti-unit Noble Phantasm that forms a pair with Howl, Mine Rage.
It doesnt invalidate enemy’s buffs, but instead strengthen one’s own encampment.
On top of that, it also drives an attack to the enemy.

As if heaps of present falling down from the sky, it truly can be said as blessing itself.
