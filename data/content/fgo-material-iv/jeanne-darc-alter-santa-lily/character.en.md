### Personality

She acts like a grown up, but when she got confused she goes into panic and ends up crying. She herself insists that “I’m not crying!”, but no matter how you look at her she is definitely half in tears.

She wants the Master to spoil her, but due to have never done anything of the sort, she becomes at loss on what to do and then cries again.

She is comparatively indifferent towards the other Servants, with the exception of those saint-type Servants and especially the childish, children Servants. Her favorite phrases are “Are you and idiot!?” and “Refutation!” and such.

### Attitude towards Master

She puts in great effort to come across as a “Servant who puts her act together”, but since she is still a child she still wants to be spoiled.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Lancer. Jeanne d’ArcAlterShantaLily! N-No I didnt bite my tongue!”
“Everybody, please pull yourselves together! It’s really troubling when you all act so slovenly. You are making it hard for the others!”
“Sob……sob… uuu! I-I’m not crying! I’m not!”
“Now, time to work as a santa! I am going to do as much as I can!”
“Now it has been proven that you are a slovenly adult. A perfect refutation!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

…Jeanne d’Arc enters the pages of history at the age of 17. Consequently, before that she is a girl of a countryside farmer family working hard, and there is no other record of her besides that.
Although no one would deny her faith and piety, she did not display any sort of wondrous miracle until she was 17 years of age.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The current Jeanne d’Arc Alter Santa Lily is born as the result of filling the nonexistent past of of Jeanne d’Arc (Alter).

However, because a saint takes part in it, the attribute of “person of firm character” is put in, and because she is a child the attribute of “crybaby” and “spoiled child” is also put in, resulting into “a kid who overstretch herself as a spendid adult”.

### General Armaments

A spear.

She is not going to become that sort of adult.
She so swear. To be more specific, the sort of adult that flip the table out of anger from losing at a party game!
“Ah, also, because I becoming Santa is partially your fault I want to make clear your liability in the matter as well”
“Don’t remember. My secretary (Gilles) did it.”

#### Jeanne d’Arc

The aspiration as her true self. She calls her “original me”, pulls on the sleeve and has her spoil her.
Jeanne fawns over her, Jeanne d’Arc (Alter)’s stress piles up, while Tamamo Cat curls up in the kotatsu.

The mysterious Santa Island Mask. “True, there’s a smidge part where he is absolutely suspicious looking, but he is my teacher nonetheless. Kind of like a father!” “Suspicious looking huh… suspicious looking indeed (consent)”
