Swimsuit, lines, are few. Wonderful! Though I was not sure whether I thought about that or not since swimsuits have a splendour for a summer event, so I enjoyed drawing this. Healed at a white beach…
A point I figured out is that, because the event moves forward from its initial state, there’s the matter of keeping from the start the circumstances of wearing a straight swimsuit. Fortunately, I felt like opening up a new side of Sir Mordred. Hey, although I’m saying this in the confusion of the moment, that being the case, I’m also waiting for a request to draw a swimsuit for a male Servant! Because!
