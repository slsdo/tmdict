### Personality

Her spirits is overwhelmingly higher than the usual Mordred, so it is easy to catch sight of her riding.

### Attitude towards Master

Given that she removed both her armour and sword now, she is not being a slave to the restraints of being a knight. As for Mordred herself, she intends to enjoy this one summer to her heart’s content.

### Dialogue Examples

“Howdy, Master! Heeh, I came to play! Ah, do keep this a secret from father! This board, I took it out secretly!”
“Alrighty then! I can tell you that the feeling of ignoring the king’s orders is the best! I’m just about to go back to the sea and even ride on the waves again!”
“Master, the south wind is blowing. This is the sea’s once in a lifetime rampage. So, let’s go surfing together. Yeah, even if this body vanishes someday, this is unforgettable, since it’s something I don’t want to forget.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

It is no different from the original Mordred’s.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Since it’s the summer, the cute Miss Mo possesses an excitement on the high side! She’s sort of getting into the mood. Well, it’s nice that a childhood friend randomly turned up and jumped into the verandah near your personal space while being all friendly, right?! Isn’t that right?!

… Because half of Mordred’s life was mostly in relation to Britain and the Knight King, it is like Mordred as an individual does not exist, so to speak. Concerning her who was born, raised and fought for the sake of killing the Knight King, it is even possible to say that this situation happens to be the first vacation in her life. As the Master is patient, they want to show off to her what a vacation can be.

Mordred will not get tired of it. Just by seeing her rich facial expressions, it seems summer and the like will pass by in the blink of an eye.

### General Armaments

A surfboard (Prydwen).
