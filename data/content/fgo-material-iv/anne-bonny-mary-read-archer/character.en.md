### Personality

They begin their approach in the same way as the original Anne & Mary whom attained Bond 5. Since it is summer, they feel a little bolder in approaching their Master.

“It’s completely OKAY if you see them to that extent; it’s even OKAY to touch them. Will you proceed with this up to the very end?”

### Attitude towards Master

They are a rare pair of female pirates, but this time, they visit the Master in swimsuits carefreely. With a ‘Bonny!’ feeling, Anne attacks the Master in a swimsuit with a high degree of exposure, while Mary pouts in dere towards the Master with a physique that has a ‘Read!’ feeling to it, turning into a pincer attack.

### Dialogue Examples

Anne: “Come on Master… Making us fight with such an appearance! You’re such a brute, hahah.”
Mary: “I really protested this to Master, but…”

Mary: “Hey Master. Listen, Anne might come to compel you excessively, but that person is so going to arouse you persistently instead. So you shouldn’t go along with her ride, okay? If you get on board with that, I’ll scorn you, really scorn you! REALLY!”
Anne: “Master… Master, Master, Master. Hehe, what a wonderful sound. Even if they’re passions that will only last for a single summer, I’m happy right now. Yes, awfully so.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

As a matter of course, it is the same with them as a Rider.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Due to getting into swimsuits, the duo decided to notify to others more and more of their dere frequencies. Furthermore, they truly do not want the Master to feel something along the likes of them wanting him or her to choose either one of the two; rather, they intend for the Master to choose them as a set.

### General Armaments

A musket.

### Connections with Characters

#### Other Swimsuit Characters

“What are you afraid of? Here is The Great Duo that combined the set of large and small. It doesn’t matter how alluring the others are, for there’s no one out there that will surpass our charm!”… or so they think.

#### Blackbeard

“For the summer period, shouldn’t we gouge out his eyes?”
“Acknowledged.”
