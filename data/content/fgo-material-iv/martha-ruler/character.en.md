### Personality

It should be as usual, but… as a matter of fact, Martha’s state of being has become somewhat anxious given that she does not carry her cross. Because of that, it is possible to catch glimpses of the signs of “those times” from before she held the holy staff appearing and disappearing. When compared to her materialization as a Rider, the frequency is somewhat higher. For Martha herself, who has manners like this, the way she loses her bearings is unconcealable, even though she has a feeling where she is not sure if this is the Lord’s trial.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Judging from appearances, Martha is her usual self. However, it is also a matter of time before she becomes serious in accepting everything from the Master as it cannot be helped that, since now that it has come to this, the Master begins to appear as her “younger brother”.

Even if things turn for the worse, Martha will not be wishing on the Holy Grail to return to her original Saint Graph. There is only one Holy Grail as far as Saint Martha is concerned, and even if her Saint Graph is altered, she will not be misled by a fake Holy Grail too. That is her foregoing thought.

### Dialogue Examples

“————Martha. I have come once again. No matter which form I take, I am still me. Without hesitation, I shall save the world together with you.”
“Surely, we will save the world, ok? Hey! Answer me!”
“Let’s do this heavily.”
“Let’s do this sharply.”
“Let’s do this violently.”
“Repent! Reform now I say!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

It is completely the same as the time when she materialized as a Rider.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Brandishing an Iron Fist, she breaks steel. With a single attack of her Strong Fist, she pierces even a dragon. With the words of the Messiah (that person) carried in her heart, even now, her vow as a Saint has not been forgotten.

————“This body surely exists for the sake of the people.”

“Apart from that, I won’t allow a slacken lifestyle just because it’s summer!”

Even if her form has changed, and even if there are some changes in her words, Martha is still herself. Nothing but a perfect Saint who intends to save the world and mankind. However, in any event, it is a special materialization. As she says, this is the Lord’s trial, or is it————

### General Armaments

Hand-to-hand combat attacks. Basically unarmed. If anything, Martha has the Holy Knuckles armaments equipped on her third stage Ascension. “Even though I wanted to be a Saint, why!?” She says as Martha herself seemingly complains.

### Connections with Characters

#### Moses / Jacob

“Moses, Jacob, please forgive me for swinging my fist. I believe this is also undoubtedly a step to take for the sake of saving the Human Order.”

#### Beowulf / Li Shuwen / Assassin of Shinjuku

“I did not say something like, “A barehanded brawl, that’s just fine!” I did not say that. Since I did not say that, please do not send your looks of anticipation for such a behaviour from me. Haaa…”

#### Mary

“Younger sister. I can’t show such an appearance to you!”
