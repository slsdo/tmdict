### Saint of the Waterside: B+

Having drifted on board a boat and reined in the Tarasque by the Rhône’s riverbank, Martha has deep connections to water. That disposition was strengthened by changing into a swimsuit at this occasion. Upon perceiving a waterside, Martha’s offensive power rises. She gets on board.

### Natural Body (Sea): A+

Martha’s body, which was undressed from holy garments, is perfect as a living being. It is amazing when undressed. It is a Skill that denotes the absoluteness of the body, but it also functions as a charm Skill towards others.

### Jacob’s Limbs: B

An old method of hand-to-hand combat that was continuously inherited from Jacob, to Moses, and finally to Martha. If reached to its limits, one can triumph even over an archangel. According to legends, a Saint who mastered this can surely beat an “angel of destruction” that leads 12,000 angels to death. In addition, the reason why Martha can bring out “that sort of behaviour” when releasing the True Name of her Noble Phantasm is surely because of this Skill.

### True Name Discernment: C

Automatically grasps a Servant’s True Name as well as their entire status information during a direct encounter. However, in regards to Servants who possess concealment abilities, a success of a Luck Check becomes a requirement to bypass those abilities.

“It is expected that I have it. It is a Skill one should be endowed with as a Ruler.”

### Divine Ruling: A

The supreme privilege of a Ruler. One can exercise two Command Spells for each Servant participating in a “Holy Grail War”, but in “Fate/Grand Order”, this consists of different Skill effects. However, Martha fundamentally does not use this Skill in “Fate/Grand Order”.

“It is expected that I have it but… seeing that it is not a Holy Grail War, what I know is that even the role of a Ruler has come to be altered in due course, do you not think so?”
