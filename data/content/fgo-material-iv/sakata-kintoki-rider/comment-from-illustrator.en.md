Kintoki is dyed by the culture of the present and so his Noble Phantasm is a motorcycle. I went with an easy to understand design by making him wear riders jacket. His signature sunglasses are left as is, his hairstyle is wild, and his figure is slimmed down a bit. In a sense, I’d like to think that this is probably the fashion that came about from Kintoki’s own misinterpretation of the word “rider”. His last ascension is my favorite. I had fun drawing it.
