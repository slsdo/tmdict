Golden Drive.
A large motorcycle imbued with Raijin’s power.
According to Kintoki, it is a monster machine possessing 2 million horse powers. Its maximum speed is 2500 kilometer (around Mach 2). Its name that has been given by Kintoki is “Golden Bear Mk. 1”.
The cherished mount bound to Kintoki when he is summoned as a Rider. It possesses the ability to transform by its nature. But on this occasion, Bear Mk. 1 has been configured to perform a super charging dash during its True Name Release.

(It only appears in FateGO during the usage of Yoroshiku)

Golden Drive Good Night.
A charging dash on Golden Bear in its Super Accel Assault Mode.
At maximum speed, it can reach hundreds of times its normal speed.
Wreathed in lightning, Bear Mk. 1 flattens its targets. Its tires are actually Raijin’s transformed drums, and their lightning grows more powerful as they rotate. In short, this attack becomes more powerful the further Golden Bear travels.

“During my life, I was once plagued by dreadful nightmares when I lay down to sleep. These dreams, this… whirl of grudges by the many abominations, demons, and inhuman mysteries I slew, must have been sent by the curse of a Tsuchigumo. I was terribly weakened, and resigned to die.
But, one night… Kintoki stood by my bedside beating Raijin’s drums. He became brilliant lightning, and gently chased my nightmares away. Then, those cursed dreams, which had morphed into other-realms, were all incinerated by lightning.”

“Yes, thus he saved me. During my entire life, I never forgot the joy I felt that evening. Even now, I still remember it.”
“Hm? You ask what this has to do with Bear Mk. 1? Ah yes, well. The wheels of that iron horse are the very drums of Raijin which Kintoki used to save me that night.”

Above, a recorded conversation during Minamoto no Raikou’s stay at Chaldea.
This event is described in the Tsuchigumo illustrations of Utagawa Kuniyoshi, but their veracity is unknown.
