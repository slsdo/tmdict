In exchange for Buddha’s providence which makes Kintoki inseparable from his cherished mount upon being summoned as a Rider he no longer has a need for this Skill.
As a matter of fact, his Riding Skill has been sealed.

### Divinity: C

His disposition as Raijin’s child has been emphasized upon being summoned as a Rider. At the same time, the aspect of him being the child of Yamauba has also been emphasized.
