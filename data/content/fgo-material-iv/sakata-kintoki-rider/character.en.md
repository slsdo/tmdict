### Personality

To uphold justice, and to crush the wicked!
A special move to the rotten lot!
However, that is also only when he feels like it. At times, he will disregard all the troublesome things and drives his beloved mount, becoming one with the wind---

---that said, it is the world’s cruelty that things seldom go as one would hope. Only individuals whom he shares various deep histories with would close in on him. Such as, Raikou who, like a mother and a big sister, gave him unconditional love, Shuten-Douji who had once fought him to the death while being attracted to one another, Ibaraki-Douji who would bare her fangs at him every time due to her excessive feelings for Shuten.

Still, it is not like Kintoki dislikes them entirely. For both Raikou and Shuten are fellows whom he had shared deep ties and feeling with. Without a doubt, they occupy a large portion of his heart. He simply can’t grasp the distance between them well when they have manifested in this world.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Meanwhile, surely Kintoki’s peace of mind lies in the Master who confronted him as an individual unrelated to his past, for whom he’s been dying to tell “For now, let’s just empty our head and go drive with this guy (Bear Mk. 1)!”
Be sure to wear your helmet.

### Dialogue Examples

“Yo, Chief, so we meet again! Rider Kintoki has arrived at high speed! Ya wanna attack the mountain? Or ya wanna try breaking the sound barrier on the highway?”
“Rock’n roll!”
“Ain’t it obvious, boys?”
“I’m not gonna say I’ll become the wind, but let’s decide this with a drive that is even faster than the wind!”{{n2}}
“Ya can tell me anything. Be it now or the past, I’ll be by your side, Chief.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Sakata Kintoki. A member of Raikou’s Shitennou.
He is the exact same person as the Kintoki who is summoned as a Berserker.
It has often been confirmed that in cases where a Heroic Sprit is summoned into another Class there would occur a change not limited to their abilities, but also to their disposition, personality, Saint Graph, and so on. However…for Kintoki’s case, the extent of his close resemblance to his Berseker counterpart has resulted to a joke going around perpetuated among Chaldea staff: “He probably just changed his hairstyle and outfit.”

In reality, this has become a summoning in which his disposition as Raijin’s child is emphasized.
At the same time, because the aspect of him being the child of Yamauba is also emphasized, there is a possibility that he may become an even more “dangerous man” than his Berserker counterpart.
One could also see him as the Kintoki who is riding in excitement from riding his monster machine.
Yes, he is much groovier than the usual Kintoki.
In a way, his current condition can be likened as to having received the best toy; the condition of peak happiness.
As a result of having obtained knowledge of the modern world from here and there, he seems to have mixed up multiple meanings of “Rider”, and built a contemporary “Rider Belt” of his original design.

### General Armaments

Coming from his apparent misunderstanding of something, he now fights with his bare hand according to the honest and straightforward Rider Action{{n3}}.
They are strong attacks weaved with lightning.

### Golden Huge Bear Mk. I

The motorcycle Bear Mk. I is an abnormal Devil Monster Machine.
Apparently, it is a mobile machine, but not actually a motorcycle.
Kintoki says it can transform into a giant robot.
Kintoki says it is impossible to use it in town.
Kintoki says it is modeled after a giant prayer weapon blessed by Hachiman-jin, which was used in battle against the giant “Tsuchigumo of Rendaino, in Kitayama” that has the size of Shinchuu (a heteromorphic giant creature that expunges calamity).
The authenticity behind those claims is not known.
In any case, it is fundamentally not used in FateGO
