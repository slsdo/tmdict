Bathory Brave Erzsebet.
Bloody Demoness, Saber version.
A forbidden sword technique that affix the enemy with the hero power like that of a storm, clash into that space a full power, high gear rotating thrust and made the enemy explode.

Of course, the hero power is by means of Elizabeth’s sonic breath.
The super thunder screw slash unleashed to the enemy whose mind and body have been stunned by Elizabeth’s super sonic waves pulverizes even the Slave Beast{{n2}}.
