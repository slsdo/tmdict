### Hero Grand Code: EX

First, that a hero must be invincible.
Second, that a hero must always be in high spirit.
Third, that a hero freely makes use of lost properties.
……and so on and so on. Ten code in total.
As a Skill, think of it as a leading up towards the protagonist grand turn around, just like in action manga.
During that turn only, she is invincible and simultaneously has her willpower raised.
A hero shall accumulate NP as she endures multiple Noble Phantasm.

### Magic Energy Burst (Brave): D

A Magic Energy Burst, but of an extremely rare internal type.
Defense power is raised. Subtly unpleasant.

### Legend of the Crimson Hero: EX

The supreme privilege, the hero’s greatest of esoterica usable only in the movie version.
A super power up by expending 100% NP. A super buff of a similar type to Tamamo-chan Summer’s Goddess Transformation.
Randomly bestows miraculous effects such as super increase to offensive power, invincibility and recovery to entire party, and an acquisition of a large amount of stars. Unmistakably a gambler skill.
However, perhaps because it is a skill that displays each effects against formidable enemies, but during the occasion that such an enemy that does not depend on the system shows in front of her can a miracle happens only with this skill.
