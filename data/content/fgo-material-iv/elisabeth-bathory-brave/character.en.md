### Personality

The Elizabeth (Caster) who make Halloween merry and festive, turned into Saber at the end of elegant fate.
Her mood swing and wickedness took a dip, and although selfishness remains her personality becomes one that help the weak and outwit the strong.
Saber = Ally of Justice. Maybe that’s what she think of it, but anyway she misunderstand herself as one positioned as a hero, and just like that she is giving it her all the Elizabeth way. Ish.
However, she is not used to be a character on the side of justice, so she messes up a lot as usual.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She is a hero, so she is brimming with the spirit to fight alongside the Master.
She personally feels she is bound by a tight friendship with the Master.
Her awareness as a Servant is low.

### Dialogue Examples

“See here, I’m like, a hero right? And a hero must have a variety of party members, right? Just like when I was an idol, suppoerted by drums and instruments.”
“No worries, puppy/deerlet! Because I, the hero, and this darkish no good trio will protect you!”
“Yes. I am the new me, emerging from humiliation and conflict, dispossessed of evertyhing to you. Class Saber type idol, Elizabeth Brave Bathory!”

### Role within the Game

Appearing as the main character of Halloween 2016.
With the power of dragon and music, as well as the second Halloween, it feels like nobody can stop her anymore.
With pure white mantle, deep crimson armor, and a simple sword without any decoration on her hand, today too shall the Hero Elizabeth conquer.
Well, she doesn’t really practice any sort of sword skill, so she just blows it away with full power.
Bound with tight friendship with the Master, not even the sword of civilization destruction or theater of lasers or foxy curses can cut it apart. Is what she believes. (Due to that she has no awareness as a Servant.)

“Maybe I’m not actually a hero, just a sexy female knight, and the true hero is the puppy/deerlet…”

Is what going on her head sometimes, but that in itself is not bad, huh! is her positive thinking, following her own path. Truly a hero.

By the way the name of the sword is the famed sword Eighteen, and the name of the shield is the famed shield Retronia.

### Connections with Characters

#### Cleopatra

I must admit she is a genius. It’s a bit unthinkable to put a castle on top of other’s castle. It’s like an ice cream, so cute! But spare me a third one.

#### Robin Hood

That Greeny. I had thought that he was simply a rat who would bite back at the feudal lord no matter what, but seems like depending on the situation he would help too. Maybe he has some kind of knightly groundings…? This time, I will show him how to Brave!

#### Gawain

Such a dreamy, prince charming of a Saber…! He must have only about 1 Buster Card. Unmistakably a magnificent Saber!

#### Jeanne d’Arc Alter Santa Lily

Christmas is a rival. I’m envious of box gacha and such, yes, but no thank you. Really, aren’t you embarassed for picking up such a greedy atmosphere?

#### Tamamo-chan Summer

We are both anti-heroes, but I just can’t win against that fox’s free spirit… Actually, just when did she ended up getting the demon king role…
