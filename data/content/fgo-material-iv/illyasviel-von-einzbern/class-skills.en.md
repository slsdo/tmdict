### Magic Resistance: B

A powerful magic boundary granted to the transforming Illya.
Invalidates magic with chant 3 verses or less.
Unable to defend against large scale magic such as great thaumaturgy and ritual spells. (ok this line is weird because this is description for MR C, not B, so i assume misprint. for MR B peeps, it is hard to injure them even if you use great thaumaturgy of ritual spells)
Furthermore, during her transformed status her physical protection, healing acceleration, and physical ability and such are strengthened, exerting an effect to each of her status.

### Infinite Magic Energy Supply: C

A literally infinite supply of magic energy from the Kaleidostick.
But due to the output being restrained by the user’s own Magic Circuit’s ability, Illya still yet to be able to show the stick’s original power.
