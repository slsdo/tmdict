Quintett Feuer.
In the 5th volume of the original works Zwei! it was fired at the deformed giant Gilgamesh and defeated him. A super output of magic energy bombardment that surpasses Ilya’s own limit.
When invoked, she accept magic energy simultaneously from Kaleidosapphire in addition from Kaleidoruby as the foundation, the premise for “Kaleidoliner - Zwei Form”. In this form, due to it falsely taking her own nervous system and blood vessel system and others as Magic Circuit, she must prepares herself for the giant toll on her body as a compensation. Truly an attack that risks one’s own life.
