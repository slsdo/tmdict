### Pleasant-Type Mystic Code: A

The self-proclaimed Ruby-chan. Formal name “Magical Ruby.”
It is made by the old geezer sorcerer of the jewel. Within the sorcery stick dwells a natural man-made spirit.
Unnaturally obsessed with magical girls; although it supports its user, it stubbornly refuses to accept things other than magical girls.
As long as it’s having fun, everything’s fine. So, cheerful-type.

### Child of Nature: B

A miracle born of her father, Emiya Kiritsugu and her mother, Irisviel, hoped to to live a normal life.
THose miracle and love is bundled within the pure Illya, granting a blessing unto her.

### Suspicious Drug: A
