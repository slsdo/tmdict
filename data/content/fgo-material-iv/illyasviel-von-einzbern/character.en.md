### Personality

A very docile, friendly heart. An exceedingly normal girl for her age. She has a sort of bad habit where, when it comes to her bestfriend Miyu and her stepbrother Shirou, she would get worked up and a weird switch is flipped on. As she drives herself to the wall, the chaotic condition reaches its peak and she ends up throwing away everything and just runs away.

### Attitude towards Master

Revealing her confusion in Chaldea’s current situation, she is continuously surprised by the environment with Servants surrounding her. But it it is for the sake of her friend and for the sake of those in trouble, she shall wield her power as a magical girl to her heart’s content.
In regards to the Master, she takes to him/her as that of a reliable big sister/brother, and as long as it doesnt contradict her feelings she will diligently cooperate on her duty.

### Dialogue Examples

Illya: “Ruby, if you please!”
Ruby: “Alrigh~ty! Compact, full open! Illya! If you’ll excuse me!”

“Fullpower firing (Fire)!”
“Rapidfire (Shoot)!”
“Slash (Schneiden!)”
“Of course magical girls can fly, right?”
“But, it’s because this counts as a medical treatment, alright!? No feelings or interest involved whatsoever! …Okay?”

### Character Image

An elementary schooler of Homurahara Academy year 5, class 1.
In the world of “Magical Girl Prisma☆Illya” she resides in Fuyuki City.
She made a contract with the Kaleidostick Magical Ruby and became Magical Girl Prisma☆Illya.
Due to her experiencing a division of Chloe, who is an offshoot of herself, from then on the surface of her magic energy had been weakened. But by means of detailed planning and an amount of good luck, she still carries her duty as a magical girl.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She made an appearance in the collaboration event of “Magical Girl Diary \~Prisma Corps\~”.
Although she separate her ways afterwards, following the bond between her and the protagonist she is summoned as a Servant of Chaldea.
But if that’s the case, then is Ruby-chan existing simultaneously in the world of “Magical Girl Prisma☆Illya”? Also, if Miyu the Magical Sapphire isn’t there then how does she able to go to Zwei Form? Also, the heck is a Servant to begin with….?
Such and such questions infinitely arises, but don’t think too hard about it. Said MAHIRO⭐. Seriously, just don’t.

### Connections with Characters

#### Chloe von Einzbern

I must! Give my all! As the OLDER sister! But she is really reliable. But I have to say, she’s also really cheeky! (last sentence is a bit confusing, might need a recheck)

#### Kogil

I think he is a bit scarier than the Gil-kun that I know? But still, Gil-kun is Gil-kun.

#### Emiya

Although you’re being so cold, and although I and the “I” that you know are different persons, but I do know that you’re watching over me. But I never thought you’d cry from eating a mapo eggplant… even though it doesn’t taste any different.

#### Emiya (Assassin)

Uh, Mr. slightly-dark-skinned-professional-killer-who-looks-like-Papa-but-isn’t-actually-Papa? U-Um, I think k-killing people is a bad thing to do!

#### Irisviel

Mmm, a goddess-like…. something… that looks like Mama but isn’t actually Mama? Huh? There aren’t really any change at all!?
