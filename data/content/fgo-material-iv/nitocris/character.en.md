### Personality

Fundamentally, Nitocris is a wise and graceful woman, always being calm towards crises and dangers, and she possesses the emotional strength and intelligence to make it possible for her to deduce the very best move… or that is expected of her, but there is a reason why she repeatedly jumps to the wrong conclusion and why she is often short-tempered. It is because she has a fierce will burning brightly inside of her heart.

Even if she was a queen who was pushed up as a puppet, Nitocris is still a child of god, and she properly possesses the self-awareness of being a Pharaoh, a ruler who reaches for godhood. Therefore, she massacred the influential people who tried to turn the Pharaoh into an influential tool. The reason why she killed them is not only because she wanted vengeance for her brothers, but because the splendour that is the Pharaoh should not be defiled by the lower classes, and that is surely no doubt for the sake of further continuing the existence of the Pharaoh for a millennia and beyond————

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Nitocris comes into contact with the protagonist as an “allied partner”.

The wish Nitocris wants to make on the Holy Grail is “for my brothers to live peacefully in the Eternal Paradise.” For Nitocris, who became a Heroic Spirit, she does not know if her assassinated brothers had made their entry onto the road that leads into the “Eternal Paradise” in the afterlife of ancient Egypt without any problems and as should be expected; therefore, she has no choice but to wish.

### Dialogue Examples

“Lower your head. You are being disrespectful!”
“I am Horus, for I am a Pharaoh.”
“I sentence you to death, for high treason.”
“Heroic Spirit, Servant. Before all of that, I am, yes, a Pharaoh.” (Puffs out her chest)
“Perish, you unsightly people…! Your screams, your groans, your requests! There is no need to grant them to somebody like you!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A magic queen who held the throne in the Sixth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, even if only for a short time. A person who lived around the 22nd Century BC. Strangely, she has the same name with an ancient queen of Babylon.

Her throne, which became the seat for puppet Pharaohs due to the hands of influential people who made light of the gods, was smeared with blood more often than it being something to give praise to the splendour of the gods. However, Nitocris, who became a Pharaoh, cannot stop forgetting the regrets of the preceding young kings, who were her brothers, that were altogether murdered by the hands of the influential people, and the throne of the Pharaoh, worthy of splendour, was played with by the lower classes; she could not forgive that.

————“Punishment, for disrespectfully playing with even the seat of the Pharaoh, who serves as the ruler and is worthy to be god.”
————“Punishment, for committing treason in vain by putting your hands on my beloved brothers.”

Although she obediently abided with the enthronement for a short while, Nitocris advanced a “plan” in secret to kill altogether the influential people. She opened a banquet in order to gather them, the treasonous people who showed irreverence, into an enormous basement that was constructed, and in the middle of their intoxication, she filled the basement with a massive amount of water drawn in from the Nile River, killing every single person through drowning, thus having accomplished her revenge.

Afterwards, it is said that Nitocris chose to commit suicide promptly without making arrangements for her rebirth after death as a Pharaoh.

Although she was said to be the last Pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, there is no discovery of a positive proof that Nitocris clearly existed, even up to the present day, so she is also viewed as a “queen in legends”. However, the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th Century BC wrote down her existence in the “Histories”, written as the world’s first history book.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A magic queen who held the throne in an ancient Egyptian dynasty, even if only for a short time. Beyond her gentle smile, Nitocris possesses absolute confidence as a Pharaoh. The “Was” sceptre wielded in her hand is a symbol of royal authority, while simultaneously, it is the same sceptre held by the ancient Egyptian gods; it is also a magical Mystic Code that possesses a powerful Mystery. The gods blessed her to have a strong will and pride. Gifted the power of the skies, and gifted the power of the underworld, she was bestowed enough power to conduct her revenge. Was it a section of the Nile River, as written down by Herodotus, that she really used to kill her bitter enemies that she invited to the basement, or was it a torrent of evil spirits overflowing from her bronze mirror of darkness, given to her by the gods, that killed them? After death, Nitocris did not proceed towards the “Eternal Paradise” that is in the afterlife of ancient Egypt. Consequently, she committed suicide without even making arrangements of her rebirth.

Was it the blessings of the gods, or was it because of the people’s thoughts?————For later on, Nitocris would be etched onto the Throne of Heroes.

Nitocris materialized as a Servant, or so she thinks. The previous Pharaohs who died some time ago before herself, her beloved brothers, did they really make their entry onto the road that leads into the “Eternal Paradise”? She at least does not know since she herself did not arrive there. If it is the case that, at least, they are Pharaohs, let that thought be true. Visibly like the Pharaoh Ozymandias, the dazzlingly beautiful Pharaoh; wherever his brilliance that reaches the gods is————

If they live on as eternal existences, undoubtedly, the souls of her brothers will be rescued by that power.

### General Armaments

She can perform summonings by means of Egyptian magic. Scarabs, mummies, some small beings that has the appearance of the god Medjed, etc., are summoned one after another to do battle.
