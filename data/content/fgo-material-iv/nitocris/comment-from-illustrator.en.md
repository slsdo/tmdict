There was a beautiful tanned Egyptian Pharaoh girl in the design plot, so I accepted to design her as soon as I knew this and crammed a bunch of Egyptian-ish symbols on her. Hey, I personally thought I completed the design in a simple and well-coherent manner. As a matter of fact, in the middle of this work, there was a revision to the design of her third stage Ascension as her rarity was changed from a 3☆ into a 4☆, and at that time, I received a draft plan of her design from the director, so between you and me, it resulted in her third stage design as you see now. (The original design has little skin exposure.) However, she was blessed with a role in Chapter 6 of the story, and there was also the influence from “Chaldea Radio” who Miss Minami Tanaka, the voice actress in charge of Nitocris, is responsible for, so she grew into a character loved by everyone, more than what I had thought; every time it becomes this topic, I believe that it is “nice to be able to receive a design you can do.” (Shimaudon)
