A mirror that projects things that do not exist in reality. It does not function as an optical mirror. What is reflected is nothing but a grotesque and dreadful darkness that is constantly repulsive. Nitocris describes this as a mirror that reflects the netherworld, or maybe, the figure of a spiritual world of darkness, but the details are unknown. Whether it is indeed the extension of the dark abyss of the underworld, or a demonic prison manufactured by the ancient Egyptian gods, or nothing more than something forming due to the magical power welling up inside of her, what spectacle really exists on the opposite side of the mirror?
