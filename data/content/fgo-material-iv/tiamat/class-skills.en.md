### Authority of the Beast: A

A Skill that is also referred to as Anti-Humanity.
Demonstrates a special attack performance towards beings born from the “womb”, whether it is Heroic Spirits, Divine Spirits, or whatever it may be. This is conferred not only on Beast II’s main body, but also on all Magical Beasts born from her.

### Independent Manifestation: B

A Skill to materialize into the present world as an autonomous existence.
Once she has finished manifesting, the Indian Ocean will be repainted over a period of seven days. From the moment of her manifestation, she gives birth to Magical Beasts without rest, consuming humanity. On the other hand, because Beast II’s main body is the sea itself, she is not able to come ashore. Cleaning up humanity becomes the work for her Magical Beasts instead, of whom they are her children. Also, because this Skill exemplifies the way of being of “already existing anywhere even in the spacetime continuum”, it will not only cancel time paradox attacks that utilizes time travel, but it will also cancel all instant death attacks.

### Self-Modification: EX

She can remake her Saint Graph by utilizing the black Sea of Life. From her usual Saint Graph status (Femme Fatale), she can grow into a draconic body that exceeds a height of 60 meters. Tiamat, who grew into a draconic body, can cancel attacks that are A++ ranked and below.
