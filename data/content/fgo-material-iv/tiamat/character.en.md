Pronouns: Because she cannot conversate, Tiamat’s pronouns are unknown.

### Personality

Something like a personality cannot be confirmed from Tiamat. Whether she has lost her ideals, or whether she has no reason since the beginning, one cannot surmise the reason. Although she simply birthed, raised and loved her children, which was viewed as her only meaning in life, she has set out to fight against humanity, of whom they decided that for the sake of denying this meaning, they have declared “You are not needed.” Her behavioural ideology when becoming a Beast is extremely simple. “If I do not kill humanity, I will be killed.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

One of seven billion. Naturally a target for obliteration. As far as human beings are concerned, Beast II is a repulsive aggressor (invader), but concerning Beast II too, human beings are terrifying extraterrestrials (aliens).

### Dialogue Examples

“A————Aaaaaa, aaaaaaa————”

### Historical Image · Character Image

One of the primordial deities in Sumerian Mythology. In Sumerian Mythology, the gods were given birth from the pairing of Tiamat, who is the salt water, and Abzu, who is the fresh water. Afterwards, the gods, whom are their children, waved their banner of revolution against the primeval father Abzu and acquired supremacy over the world. At this moment, Tiamat gently approved the deeds of her children. It is proof that her love for her children has won over her love for her husband.

However, the gods pointed their blades even at Tiamat, their mother. Tiamat, in her grief and disorder, gave birth to 11 Magical Beasts as her new children, and they altogether had a showdown with the gods. At the end of the conflict, Tiamat and her 11 Magical Beasts were torn apart. It is said that the gods tore up her corpse into two, forming heaven and earth from it, and thus, had established the ritual for the creation of the World of Man.

### Role within the Game

Beast II was “a womb discarded after the Genesis”, becoming the origin of Sumerian Mythology. She was turned into a “Mother Sea” and was put to use as a breeding ground to produce life, but once the earth’s environment stabilized and after the ecosystems were established, she was banished to the World of Imaginary Numbers (a world on the Reverse Side; an imaginary space that has no life and is not even a Parallel World) as something unnecessary. (Seeing that the ecosystem was already established, there is no need for her, one who designs life randomly, and it is said that regarding the course the lifeforms who acquired intelligence conforms to, she was nothing but an impediment by now.) Hereafter, Beast II has been waiting in the mirror world for a chance to return back to her original world.

Beast II, who achieved her return to this world due to the distortion of the Holy Grail, has started to clean up humanity in accordance with her primal instincts. Although there is resentment/hatred/sadness for being abandoned for having already served her purpose, there is also a conduct in indulging in the “joy” of coming back to repaint the earth’s ecosystems once again as the mother of everything.

Her Class was determined by her real nature mentioned above. The Primordial Goddess and the like are but false titles. Deserted by the humans, that being is one of the great disasters most rejected by human history. That name is Beast II. One of the seven Evils of Humanity, the beast that carries the principle of “Regression”.

Also, the title called Femme Fatale was something given by Beast I (Goetia). Goetia successfully saw the true nature of Beast II’s core, so he bestowed a title meant for a Woman of Destiny rather than one meant for a Mother of the Gods (Magna Mater). At the bottom of her hatred towards humanity, there is also joy towards humanity for becoming a mother, as well as love towards humanity, them being the children of her first-generation children. For this reason, Beast II binds herself. A mother’s love is something necessary for growth, but it is something unnecessary for adults. In order for humanity to advance to the next stage, they must overcome the “original woman”.

It is a digression, but Tiamat was taken into consideration as a boss of a raid event when planning “Fate/Grand Order” in 2014. She is an anthropomorphism of the sea, someone similar to a generator that produces powerful Magical Beasts, and she was depicted as an unequalled beautiful woman that dissolves into the chaotic mud. During the moment Beast II appears, “Fate/Grand Order’s” image… becomes a fun Starship Troopers. It is also a service character that makes a homage to Dark Sakura of “Fate/stay night”. Revising that design is for some reason, two times more appealing, as long as you can see “Ah, it is a genealogy of that Dark Sakura.”
