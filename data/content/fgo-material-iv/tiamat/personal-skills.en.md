### Sea of Life: EX
Beast II is the very sea that produces life. Because it is circulating the True Ether that existed from the Genesis of the Earth, magical energy is infinitely supplied while within this sea. Beings submerged in this sea has Skills such as Self-Modification, Environmental Modification, Environmental Fusion and Unit Mitosis added to them at random. At the time of emerging from the sea to the surface, they must perform a Geas-based contract on the cellular level (Amino-Geas) with Beast II, and they automatically and completely become enemies of humanity.

### Self-Sealing: C+++

A chain of self-mutilation that ties down Beast II. Although Beast II hated her grief of being banished for “not being needed anymore” by the collective unconsciousness of humanity, the depths of her consciousness accepted that as something inevitable. Beast II, who has the role “mother” as her foundation, possesses a desire to function as a patron of humanity to the very end. This Self-Sealing is something that has become that form.

Beast II constantly seals herself. This self-inflicted pain is equivalent to giving herself a damage that deals 50% of Beast II’s current HP every turn. In the rare cases where Beast II emerges from the sea while losing her self-control, the seal admonishes her for this and the damage is raised to 90% of her HP instead for a moment. This is why she has +++ in this Skill.

### Nega-Genesis: A

A Skill of the same kind as “Nega-Messiah” that Beast VI possesses. A conceptual Bounded Field that entirely disproves the predictions of how the earth was created, the current evolutionary theory. By carrying this, Beast II nullifies Noble Phantasms of Servants born from the proper human history. Specifically speaking, a barrier takes root against the Noble Phantasms of Servants with the attributes “Man” and “Star”.

### Monstrous Strength: A++

An ability one has as a monster. Raises one’s Strength.
This is almost of the highest grade. Having the black mud as her body and materializing with a draconic body, Tiamat’s Strength is like that of a giant’s.
