### Riding: A

Talent for riding. It is natural for the Lancer class, but it feels like the rank is very high.

### Divinity: A++

Wakemitama (bunrei) of a divine spirit…or avatar, or incognito…that is what supposed to be. But this is the result of summer. Shining like the sun on the beach! As if that sexy pose is the normally suppressed Divinity. What is going on, good wife fox?

### Territory Creation: A

What “trauma from the past”? Summer beach is my hunting ground, needless to say it’s the power to create territory. Be elegant at any time and any place, the beach parasol is not just for show.
