### Personality

Even when she wears a swimsuit, as expected, she’s still the usual Tamamo-no-Mae. But thanks to being in a vacation, she has completely exhausted her magical energy, turning into the beast of summer. That is the reason for her abnormally high physical ability. Perhaps due to having full flexibility and leeway, she seems to be more refined and high society than the usual Tamamo. She’s under the assumption of being an elegant mannequin herself. But a true elegant lady wouldn’t cheerfully carry a swim ring with intention of playing around.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

While she appeals her beauty as a woman, this doesn’t mean she’s making love-traps whenever she has the chance. When it comes to summer・beach・parasol, it’s about the chance to showcase her refinement. A strategy of putting up more charms than usual, so that the other party is already madly in love by the time they return to their ordinary days. “Instead of a lady, isn’t she a hunter?” “Yup, exactly, Master. Despite being the Original, she is the Tamamo-no-Mae who stuck one foot into the Tamamo-Nine… hunter of the sea, aka Tamamo Shark.”{{n1}}

### Dialogue Examples

“SUNSHINNNNE!” (“Hottt!” nuance) *When got hit with enemy Noble Phantasm*
“Beneath the umbrella, a beauty gazing wistfully at the far horizon… Aah, what ennui! This is the sunset summer beach seen in dreams. Now, there are no more regrets… …No, I’ve still got a lot.”
“Ah… Summer will be over… Though there’s still things I really want…but it might be good to leave it at that. Thank you for playing along with my selfishness, Master. …These memories will always… Forever… Will be recorded in the Tamamo-chan Album. If you forget… It’s going to be scary☆!”

### Role within the Game

When talking about summer, it is the beach.
When talking about beach, it is the parasol.
When talking about parasol, it is yours dependable miko-fox.
This is, surely, the common sense of the Ashihara no Kuni…! A solar explosion.
With wet T-shirt and a swim ring as her weapons, Lancer Tamamo-chan, shining like the sun on southern countries!
…To understand her enthusiasm, let me explain. Tamamo-no-Mae is good-wife aspirant miko shaman. She was a peerless beauty who served Emperor Toba as his most favored court lady at the end of the Heian period. She was also said to be the Golden Fur White Face Nine Tailed Fox and the bunrei of the great goddess Amaterasu in the Throne of Heroes. Having that much of a career, it might be fine to live a life of enjoying a vacation in the southern countries…is what Tamamo-chan thought.

### Connections with Characters

#### Kiyohime (swimsuit)

Kiyohime-san has a naginata…! Though originally she was someone with a Chinese flavour, now totally has the taste of a luxury Chinese cuisine takeout huh…Ah! Naginata, doesn’t it overlap with my parasol?

#### Martha (swimsuit)

A fist-fighting cleric with long black hair… Ugh, my head… Oh well, that’s Martha-san for you. Tarasque-san, try your best to survive, okay?

#### Kiara Sessyoin

Just thinking about her already gives me headache, Nope!
Eh, principal deity{{n2}} or not, I don’t hate selling style argument. But it’s better that she should have some self-restraint. No, it’s not like that’s a problem in my perspective. Once she shows her true nature, the amount of sharp and wicked language will also increase, right?

#### Nero (swimsuit)

Wh…why are there homing lasers shooting out of your theater!?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Tamamo Cat talking.
2. {{note2}} Shingon Buddhism reference. Kiara’s sex cult is a branch of Shingon so Tamamo is the principal deity of her cult.
