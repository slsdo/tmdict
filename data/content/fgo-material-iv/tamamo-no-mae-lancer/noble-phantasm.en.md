Tokonatsu Nikkou - Hiyokegasa Chouai Isshin.
“Sunshade” is something drawn as a “charm against evils spirits”. It is filled with a prayer of eradicating the bad bugs that stick to the master. In a certain other world, it is also called “Polygamist Castration Fist”. Of course, it is a special attack against males. For detailed story, Robin Hood is (probably) well-informed. During the Noble Phantasm animation, there is an exclusive bust portrait, and Tamamo-chan is happy “Such gorgeous Noble Phantasm, yay me!”. But a year later, a surprise situation arrived. “Of course it’s me! ☆”{{n1}}
