### Beach Flower: EX

Is she really the incarnation of a sunflower? Attack power of allies are raised and additional effects are granted for male Servants. Her figure is just like a goddess of summer. “No no, I am an actual deity right?”

### Midsummer Witchcraft: A

Powerful charm ability. Although the enemy suffers from various debuffs, at the same time charge gauge increases due to their mood being lifted. A skill that requires getting used to, but a very powerful and convenient skill when used right{{n1}}. Turning demerit into merit!

### Goddess Metamorphosis: B

Highest form of Shapeshifting skill. User transforms into a goddess, gaining a feast of buffs. But then she is stunned afterwards. Apparently there was a holy woman in a certain cyberspace who acquired this Skill{{n2}}. Incidentally, Tamamo’s Divinity has casually became A++, but that is because her aspects as Amaterasu leaking out under the summer sun modifiers, or something like that.
