### Personality

A gentle intellectual.
Level and calm, although he as human emotions, since he is an educator, he fundamentally doesn’t deem acceptable letting the negative emotions come to the surface.

It is said that he makes the presence of a quiet forest waft, but that’s an indication of his gentle attitude.

The Centaurs he belongs to are generally treated as a violent and irrational barbarian tribe, but Chiron is an exception and he was treated in Greece as a wise man.

If it had to be explained in a few words, 『a teacher by nature』.
That is no exception even after having become a Servant.

### Attitude towards Master

He fundamentally behaves reverently like a butler, but if the Master is immature (and if they request his teachings), he’ll gladly instruct them.

However, Chiron, who is aware that he is a guest, always gives guidance to his Master while considering what will happen after he leaves.

### Dialogue Examples

「I see. If this is a Holy Grail War even though provisional,
this possibility wasn’t unlikely.
…Destiny sometimes bares its fangs even to us the dead」

「No, there’s only one thing that I want to tell you. You are wonderful.
No matter what kind of hardship you find in your life hereafter,
you will be able to walk facing forwards without being disheartened.
I’m convinced that you’re that kind of pupil」

「Has my star pierced the spot that it had to pierce?
…… At the end of the end, it seems I finally managed to fulfill my duty as a Servant」

### Historical Image · Character Image

The great wise man in Greek mythology.
Because of him being well versed in all sorts of knowledge and the dexterity of his way of teaching there are countless heroes in Greece who received his teachings.
Heracles, Achilles, Jason, Asclepios, Castor… Though the periods are different, they all are pupils of Chiron.

Chiron is the child born from the union of Zeus’ father, Cronos, and the fairy Philyra, but since Cronos copulated with her while transformed as a horse, Chiron, who was birthed, was born as a half-man, half-horse Centaur.

Without upbringing Chiron, Philyra changed her form into a linden tree.

In any case, a grown Chiron was endowed with all types of knowledge as a sage by the gods, and began upbringing a 「future hero」 before long.
He had a friendship with Achilles’ father, Peleus, and Peleus trusted Chiron so much he entrusted Achilles to him when he realized he couldn’t raise Achilles.

One day, the Centaurs and Heracles quarreled carried away by being drunk, and Chiron, who tried to stop them, received an arrow with poison of the Hydra.
Chiron had acquired immortality as a god, but even though he was immortal he couldn’t escape from the pain of the poison, and continued tasting an infernal suffering.

There, he begged to the gods, and chose to die by giving up his immortality.
And it is told that because the gods regretted his death, he was sublimated as the stars of Sagittarius.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Even if it’s a normal Holy Grail War, or a special format ———— a situation of seven vs. seven, Chiron is a candidate for victory, and a sage that occupies an important position.

That doesn’t change in Chaldea, and there is no end to the Servants requesting his teachings.

The opposite is affirmative as well, for Chiron Chaldea, where owners of super-first class techniques and knowledge surpassing first class are striding, is an ideal workplace, and he’s impressed to have a new experience every day.

### General Armaments

Bow and arrows, empty-handed (pankration)

### Connections with Characters

#### Achilles

I once fought you bare-handed.
The outcome was uncertain, but…
What do you think, how about we try it once here?

#### Former students

Oh, did everyone come too?
My assistance may have been small, but even so it makes me quite proud and happy that all of you have become heroes.
That said, there are still some parts that lack teaching.
Come on, let us learn enthusiastically! Let’s work hard!

#### Zhuge Kongming

I see. That style of teaching is the power of the individual that became the vessel.
Wonderful. If you don’t mind, could you teach me as well?

#### Sieg

Oh… It seems I fought together with you in the past.
On that occasion, there wasn’t much of a temporal extension, but it’s different here.
Now, let us study the course slow and carefully.
