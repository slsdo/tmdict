### Magic Resistance: B

Invalidates anything regarding invocation of magecraft with a chant of three verses or lower.
Even with High-Thaumaturgy/Greater Rituals, wounding him is difficult.

### Independent Action: A

Can act even in absence of a Master.
However, in the case of requiring vast amounts of mana such as for the usage of his Noble Phantasm, back-up from his Master is necessary.

### Divinity: C

A being born from the union between the god of the earth and a fairy, but in order to make his body decline into that of a human just before his death, it is reduced in a large scale.
