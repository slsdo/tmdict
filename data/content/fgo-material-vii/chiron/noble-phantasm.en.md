Antares{{n1}} Snipe.
The embodiment of the episode in which Chiron, turned into Sagittarius, is always aiming at the celestial scorpion.
The ultimate strike a bowman can reach, piercing the stars.
A meteoric strike that can be launched at the point the True Name is released, and that is fired not from his bow, but from the stars.
Even Achilles, renowned for being a fast runner, couldn’t dodge this Noble Phantasm.
There is the demerit of only being usable once a night, but it won’t miss the target unless the timing is wrong.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Antares is the brightest star of Scorpio. It’s in the middle of the constellation and Arabs called it “the heart of the scorpion”. The NP’s name is literally “sniping the heart of the scorpion”.
