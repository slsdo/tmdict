### Territory Creation: EX

As a queen, she’s able to reproduce her castle anywhere she goes.
To modern magecraft, this extraordinary ability would be equal to Temple-level, but Skadi herself claims that she’s “not very good” at creating territory. If so, one must wonder how incredible the God of Magic Odin’s abilities would be.

### Item Creation: A

As a queen, she’s able to create many things with her mana.
She can create anything from miraculous medicines to equipment to tree seeds, but they all seem to be created with a low temperature. Her items will be cold to the touch.

### Goddess Essence: A

A skill that symbolizes her status as goddess.
A composite skill that includes Divinity.
Due to Scathach-Skadi possessing both god and giant attributes, she has been classified as A-rank instead of EX.
