When I first heard “Queen Scathach”, I thought “Queen of the Land of Shadows”? But it turns out it was something completely different and she ended up being the frivolous queen of the land of ice. Her first stage was designed thinking of a queen who would likely live in a castle of ice. Her second stage has her changing to something closer to combat attire. Her third stage was designed as something more like a battle dress. It seems her third stage got used to allude to her legend as the bride of the gods. I designed her to be younger and of a smaller build compared to Scathach. I drew her with the intention of them being completely different characters despite looking similar. (Koyama Hirokazu)
