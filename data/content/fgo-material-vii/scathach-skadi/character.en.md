### Personality

The bride of the gods, and queen of the Norse lostbelt.
She doesn’t possess any traits of the mentor of heroes, nor is she a master in the art of combat.
It would be correct to think of her as an entirely different entity from the panhuman Scathach who can be summoned as Lancer or Assassin.

Unlike the Lancer Scathach who was easy to approach while acting detached, Skadi possesses a natural detachment and fickleness befitting of a goddess, and will sometimes say things like “Did I step on something?”, “Hello, little one” or “Should I love you, or kill you”.
She lets out a breath, which becomes a blizzard that extinguishes life.
She puts on a smile, which becomes spring and allows life to bloom.
To her, these are the same thing.

However…
There’s a feeling she kept hidden during her time as queen of the lostbelt. The sorrow of being one who “was left behind”.
There was a time when she was loved and proposed to by many gods, but before she realized, ragnarok has passed, and she was left alone as the last god in the world of the lostbelt.

If one were to deepen their bonds with her, they’d eventually come to see another side of her…Not her as a queen, but rather her own character.
Once her mask as a goddess, ruler and mother of the north comes off, one will come to see her true self.

### Attitude towards Master

The Scathach-Skadi that comes from the lostbelt recognizes Lancer Scathach as a different person. Even if one had created a deep relationship with her Lancer self, there would be no choice but start over from scratch with Skadi.
Queen Scathach doesn’t have much interest in humans, but maybe she would eventually start to feel something after observing her Master as they try to save the world.

### Dialogue Examples

“Did I step on something?”
“Hello, little one. So you’ve called upon me, who reigns over the blizzards of death.”
“Struggle all you want. I won’t allow you to give up until you’ve shivered, frozen and broken down.”
“Should I love you, or kill you”.
“I’ve made up my mind. You must dissolve into the shadow of my castle.”
“Stop, stop, do not get so close to me like that. I am not very fond of humans’ heat.”
“It’s so hot…Huh, w-what? Stop. Pretend you did not hear that. Die. Freeze and die. Become ice and cool me down.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Skadi’s name means “the one who creates wounds” in the old Norse language. According to the poem of Grímnismál from the ancient Edda, she’s the daughter of the evil giant Thiazi, and they live in an old home on the tumultuous country of Thrymheim.
Later she married the norse gods and became known as the “beautiful bride of the gods”.
Skadi was also known as Öndurguð (Ski God) and Öndurdís (Ski Goddess). She was a master of hunting in the mountains and skiing.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A Servant coming from the Norse lostbelt.
A completely different entity from the panhuman Scathach, and an existence that can only materialize in the lostbelt. She has inclined more heavily towards her attributes as goddess and queen.
She displays many of the traits of the goddess Skadi, who shares her origin with the celt hero Scathach.
Rather than “a Scathach who is very much like Skadi”, it’d be more accurate to call her “a Skadi who possesses some of Scathach’s traits”.

The Scathach and Skadi presented in the game aren’t completely equal, and it could be interpreted like the two influenced each other and melded together. The fact the Lancer Scathach possesses Odin’s primordial runes, could be due to this melding.

According to the Heimskringla, Skadi left her first husband, the sea god Njörðr, and re-married to Odin.
The Skadi in the game is unmarried, but it seems she was wanted enough for it to be written that way into posterity…or so she was supposed to be.

The “Scathach-Skadi” who appeared in the lostbelt has her Skadi side being especially dominant, and so she displayed many of her attributes as bride of the gods.

She appears cool-headed, but is actually quite careless.
She appears calculating, but is actually quite oblivious.
She appears to be like cold ice, but is actually quite warm.
She was loved and treated dearly by the gods as their beautiful bride, and thus she doesn’t possess the strictness of Scathach. She possesses very few aspects of the Scathach from Celt myth, including having almost no knowledge about the Land of Shadows, but still possesses a Noble Phantasm belonging to it. Skadi doesn’t seem to find this strange.

She is a being who lived through the lostbelt, and in a way, could be said to be the existence that best represents them.
Usually, Scathach-Skadi is a being who only exists in the lostbelts. If a similar being were to exist in panhuman history, it would likely be an avatar of Skadi as a full goddess.

By the way, she may have been called the bride of the gods, but in the midst of all the fighting over her, nobody managed to actually marry her and then Ragnarok came and they all died protecting her. It’s likely that Odin’s the one she had affection for, but she’ll never say it. When talking about details of the age of gods, especially early Ragnarok, she simply puts on a desolate smile.

When summoned into Chaldea, she’s still summoned as the Scathach-Skadi of the lostbelts. She was quite surprised when she saw the panhuman Scathach. “That other me seems much more mature…Not only that, she’s also much more dependable…!?”

### Others

The “Chaotic” part of her attribute is something she sees herself as. This is due to the fact that she realizes that during her time as ruler of the lostbelt, her will was the law of society, but having died and been summoned as a Servant things are now different.

It would appear that there exists a saint graph for a “Queen Scathach-Skadi” that has the panhuman Scathach as its “main” persona.

### General Armaments

Frost magecraft.
Sometimes a number of spears similar to Gae Bolg will materialize from the shadows, but she doesn’t seem to understand why she can use these.

### Connections with Characters

#### Scathach (Lancer)

No way…That other me, isn’t she too imposing…?

#### Scathach (Swimsuit)

Awawa, that’s so embarassing.

#### Cu Chulainn(s)

They make me feel strange.
Somehow I can’t seem to face them and talk.

#### Queen Medb

There are many ways to go about being a Queen. I have to say her methods aren’t bad.
…Or so I thought to myself coolly, but Medb won’t stop talking to me.

#### Brynhildr

Poor girl…
Or so I thought, but recently I’ve been changing my way of thinking.

#### Valkyries

Will those girls walk the same path as their older sister?
So I wondered, but…

#### Sigurd

I finally managed to get used to him after being summoned.
At first I couldn’t help but scream “Surtr!” every time we met.
