### Primordial Runes

The ability to freely control norse runes.
Unlike the runes commonly used by modern magi, these are the original runes created by the great god Odin. Their power transcends human understanding.

### Freezing Blizzard: B

A skill that represents her attribute as the goddess of the icy mountains, Skadi.
The manifestation of the cold winds of the north that freeze all of creation.
Normally this ability is part of her goddess authority, so if she uses it at A rank or above, Queen Scathach’s spiritual core will completely shatter. Due to this, the use of this skill is limited to B rank.

### Wisdom of the Great God: B+

Due to being known as “the beautiful bride of the gods”, Skadi’s body possesses the blessings and protection of the Norse gods.
A skill based on the wisdom obtained by the Great Odin when he gave up one of his eyes. It’s similar but differs from Scathach’s “Wisdom of Dún Scáith” skill.
