Gate of Skye.

This Noble Phantasm temporarily opens a gate to the demonic realm of The Land of Shadows, that exists separate from our world. During activation, the Castle of Shadows can be seen. This castle is part of the domain controlled by Scathach, not Skadi.

Within the area of effect affected by this Noble Phantasm, only those approved by her will receive various blessings and fortune. Even those who are weak and powerless gain the strength to defeat great enemies if they are loved by the Castle of Shadows.

If this Noble Phantasm were to be used effectively in a normal Grail War, there is a possibility that it could bring incredibly unexpected results.

Scathach-Skadi doesn’t completely understand why she’s able to use this Noble Phantasm. She seems to think of it as the blessings she received from the gods being used through the power of her other self (Scathach).
