An Ainu-y Illya-san. Or rather Ainu outfits are approximately like this. I lasciviously reduced the ornaments, and given she’s SN Illya I increased the elder sister facial expressions. I change the characters I’m responsible for again and again many times, but Sitonai was like that as well. If I thought she was going to be a techniques character she was a fighter-type, Shirō was a dog a the beginning, and there was even a plan to make the bear speak. Now it’s a charming bear but initially it was realistic. It was unpopular because it was 「Scary! (lol)」 so I made it in a fantastic style. Also, if there is a chance I’d like to add many Costume Dresses. (BLACK)
