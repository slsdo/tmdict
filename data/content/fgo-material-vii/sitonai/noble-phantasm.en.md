Oputateshike Okimumpe{{n1}}.
The hound that is the comrade of arms of the Ainu little girl hero Sitonai has turned into a species of familiar.
It has been strengthened many times by magecraft from the Age of Gods by Freyja and Louhi.
At this point its shape isn’t that of a hound but looks more like a bear, and its way of being has become closer to an Elemental.
If it’s the familiar of a goddess, a huge frame is befitting, and its attribute being not a Demonic Beast or a Phantasmal Beast but an Elemental is befitting as well ———— It seems that, as a result of Freyja accepting such claim from Louhi, a bearification was done with the agreements of two out of three parts.

A constantly active-type Noble Phantasm.
At the time of releasing the True Name, a continuous attack like a landslide consisting on 「a charge by the hound (bear)」, 「a bow strike accompanied by mana of ice」, 「a slash by Sitonai」 is performed.
Due to Sitonai’s nature, it displays a special effect against dragons.

### Freeze, Forces of Heaven: Pohjola Fimbul

Pohjola Fimbul.{{n2}}
Manipulates the power of freezing coldness, snow, and congealing.
Once the cursed words are released, day and night are lost from heaven, and the whole nation above the ground becomes an immobile world of silence.
Its exact classification is an Anti-Country Noble Phantasm, but in 『FateGO』 is represented as an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm.
A Noble Phantasm formed by combining the tradition of the witch Louhi who sealed the sun and the moon in a cave, and a part of the imagined landscape of Illya. The Noble Phantasm of Louhi herself has a different effect and name.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Oputateshike is the name of a mountain in Hokkaido. Okimmumpe means “flood”, though I remember having read somewhere that it’s also “landslide”.
2. {{note2}} Pohjola, as explained later, is the kingdom ruled by Louhi. Fimbul is an Old Norse preffix meaning “great”. I’m not sure about it, but this could be a reference to Fimbulvetr, the three consecutive winters before Ragnarök, since Illya’s landscape of snow and ice affect the original NP.
