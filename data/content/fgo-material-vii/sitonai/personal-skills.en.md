### Snow Fairy: A

A unique skill as an Alter Ego, defined as an id_es.
The evolution of the 『Child of Nature』 skill.
Once she comes to the clear decision of treating them as a target of attack, even the loved ones can be frozen. The ability to arbitrarily freeze the targets of the surroundings.
She mostly doesn’t use this power for attack, and mainly uses it as a defensive ability. Against beings with hostile intent or harmful beings, it operates automatically. Auto-guard.

### Emotional Freezing: B

Emotional freezing. Emotionlessness.
While she is a girl that smiles innocently, her thoughts and mentality that sometimes act like those of a ruthless demon, have become a weapon.
The heart of ice sometimes becomes a sword, and sometimes becomes armor.

### Kamuy Yukara: A

An anthem in first person that speaks of oneself as a Kamuy.
She as an Alter Ego can borrow the power of several Kamuy from Ainu mythology by reciting the Kamuy Yukara.
It’s even possible to make use of the power revolving around the top Kamuy of mountains, villages, and the open seas, Pase-kamuy{{n1}}.

### Red Gold: B++

A skill revolving around the Norse goddess Freyja.
For Freyja, who attracted not only many gods but even hostile giants, there was only one to love. When she was concerned about him who was journeying, Freyja shed red gold as tears.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)
