Tengu no Hauchiwa · Akarashima Kaze.
The esoterica of the play techniques developed at Mt. Kurama, one of Shana-ō’s Playful Tales.
It’s a reproduction of the memories of the games Shana-ō played during her training period, and there are some other techniques like with Shana-ō’s Wandering Tales.

This is a reproduction of the game in which she stealthily used the feathered fan her teacher had.
The main effect is obviously causing a windstorm, but the feathered fan is said to have a wide range of abilities like multiplication, flight, shukuchi, flame manipulation, exorcism of demons…
