### Animal Communication: D

Mutual understanding of intention with animals that don’t use words is possible.
It’s something that happens because of the youthful senses of when she ran around the mountain, so it was lost when she got down from the mountain (when she’s a Rider).
It’s not like she properly speaks the language of animals, it’s purely feeling.
Normally, leaking tanuki-like words may be a remnant of the training days of the past.

Also, when asked about why the Assassin class,
「In order to get a wooden sword from my teacher while he was asleep, I earnestly practiced invisibility with the animals of the forest as my training partners, so there it is」
「No way, an Assassin just because of that?」
「Yes. I mean, I’m a genius」

### Game Method of the Tengu (Summer): EX

The style of playing at the mountain taught by the tengu.
But to Ushiwakamaru that holds the same meaning as training.
Due to her teacher teaching her that the way of living at the mountain, the way of playing and everything is training.
Skipping about the trees like a monkey, setting foot and crossing over rocks like a deer, swimming across the river like a charr.
Super-high speed mountain style parkour… or something like that.
Of course, even if she goes to the sea that way of using her body is greatly useful. (Being able to apply it)
surely was useful for the Eight-Boat Leap.

### Heaven-Sent Child of Kurama: A+

Protection granted by 『something』 existing in the mountains of Kurama.
Ushiwakamaru likely trusts it’s 「the protection of the tengu of the mount」, but details are unknown.

Ms. H: 「…The etymology of “Kurama” is a dark mountain, and its former name was Kurabuyama. But what if it was called “Kumara” a long time ago…?」
