### Personality

She’s the same person as Ushiwakamaru when she’s a Rider, but she mentally has a rather youthful and mischievous side.
But what is at the foundation of the existence known as Ushiwakamaru, the 『ability to fin a clear solution』 that tends to not feel human kindness isn’t lost.
Rather, since she has become an existence close to a tengu, sometimes privileged awareness (without sarcasm, very naturally) like 『I’m a tengu so I’m stronger than humans』 comes out.
The above-mentioned Ushiwakamaru as a mischievous girl usually has the pattern of 「giving a punishment (lesson) to the humans who don’t realize their own foolishness and laugh loudly」.

「That human is a really helpless fellow. Alright, I’ll mock and punish them!」

However against ones who performed true evil such as murder, 「There is no need for a punishment. I’ll just cut them to death」

### Attitude towards Master

Although she’s obviously conscious of the master-servant relationship as the Master, it’s thinner than usual.
Instead, recognition as a 「playmate · training partner」has increased.
Due to her values of playing with all her strength = training with all her strength, there is no hesitation in inviting Master to play.
Like a dog that follows you and wraps around your feet because it wants to play.
If you continue neglecting her because you’re busy she’ll sulk.
But because she has a personality with absolute self-confidence she won’t think 「I’m in the wrong」.
Thinking 「If it comes to this I’ll invite you to a more amusing game」, she doesn’t reconsider that 「maybe I invited them too much and they think I’m annoying」 at all.

At the same time, when you extend your hand and say 「I’ve finished my business! Let’s play!」 she’ll jump while wagging her tail so much that it could come off.
As a negative and positive aspect, the expression of her feelings is more straightforwards and less moderated than usual.

### Dialogue Examples

「It’s my first time training at the sea! My lord, let us play together with all our might!」
「The tengu of Kurama has come here! ……Just kidding」
「Pon poko rin? Hmm I see, ponpokopokori… Ah excuse me, I was talking a bit with this dog. It’s just feeling, but unexpectedly I can manage somehow or other」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Ushiwakamaru, who, touched by Hawaii’s nature in a swimsuit, for some reason approached the training period at Mount Kurama in which she ran around as she wished in the middle of nature.

What is firmly carved in her head is the teachings of her teacher at the mountain that are 「Playing is training」. That’s why while properly fulfilling her own duty as a Servant, she awaits the chance to play (train) together with her lord if there’s free time.
A loyal dog in the hustle of summer that patiently and obediently waits while wagging its tail and thinks, when will we play?
Let’s play when there’s time.

### Role within the Game

Appears in 2018’s swimsuit event 「Servant Summer Festival!」.
While fulfilling the duty of escorting the lord and Master that is the protagonist, she also helped as a member of Master and company’s circle 「Gespenst Ketzer」{{n1}} with the production of dōjinshis and being the salesgirl.
And she played.

### General Armaments

Feathered fan of the tengu, Japanese blade

### Connections with Characters

#### Musashibō Benkei

She’s playing with all her power while poking fun at the troubled former retainer.

### Ibaraki Dōji (Swimsuit)

Oh, so there are oni at the sea as well. This will be a worthwhile game (worthwhile training)… (Chaki){{n2}}

### Queen Medb (Swimsuit)

I don’t really understand the games that woman likes. Shouldn’t games be something healthier?

### Helena Blavatsky

For some reason she often stares at me with interested eyes.
Eh, seriously what on earth is 「mahatoma」?

### Animal-type · Wild child-type{{n3}} Servants

I’m close to being a wild child so it makes me want to run around together in the middle of nature (including the beach).
Kintoki-dono, how about we have one match even if it’s at sumo? …Why are you averting your eyes, Kintoki-dono?!

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Literally “Ghost Heretic” in German.
2. {{note2}} The sound of unsheathing a katana. I don’t even know how to translate that.
3. {{note3}} 自然の児. I couldn’t find a proper translation, but since Kintoki is mentioned, I guess “ild Child” will do.
