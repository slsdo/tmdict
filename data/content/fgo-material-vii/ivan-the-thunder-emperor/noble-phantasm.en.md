Chyornyj Oprichniki
The royal guards Ivan used along with his Almighty Supreme Authority.
These troops had the authority to steal land and property from the nobles, and they could be considered Ivan’s arms and legs.
They wore black, rode black horses with black gear, and hung dogs’ heads on the necks of their horses.
At the same time they carried brooms made with animal hair which had the meaning of “attacking traitors like dogs, and cleaning them out with a broom”.
This is a passive NP, but its activation is peculiar, as it requires Ivan to be unconscious.
Once he falls asleep, his troops with torturing tools in hand will start appearing everywhere to eliminate the enemies of the tsar.
They are similar to vengeful ghosts, and as the tsar’s coercive power grows, their morale and fighting ability will also grow.
They may have great strength in numbers, but they are weak individually.

The cross procession of a divine beast. The march towards the kingdom of heaven that the tsar will eventually reach (or so he believes).
This means standing in the tsar’s way is treason and blasphemy against God.
Ivan temporarily returns to his old form as a giant beast and mercilessly destroys his opponents.
