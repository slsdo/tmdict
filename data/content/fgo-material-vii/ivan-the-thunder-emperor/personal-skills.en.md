### Contradictive Mind: A

During his reign as the tsar of Russia, Ivan established a centrally controlled government which he ruled by fear.
In the mornings he’d lock himself up in a temple to repent for his sins, and in the evening he’d joyfully torture those who rebelled against him.
His mentality is something similar to that of a saint and a villain combined, and it randomly changes his alignment between the two.
That is, between lawful or chaotic.

### Innocent Monster: A

Even as a human he named himself an existence equal to god, and by driving off the nobles who boasted about their political influence, his authority managed to reach its peak.
Russia respected him as an absolute tsar, but the people of western Europe feared him and called him “the terrible”.
Now that he’s fused with a giant mythical beast from Siberia, he has now become a being completely different from what he was in life.

### Almighty Supreme Authority: A

Supreme submission and obedience through fear that Ivan sought in order to control the nobles.
The intimidating aura he puts against everyone in his surroundings creates a heavy pressure that reduces all their stats by one rank.
A regular person would find it difficult to keep their eyes open under this.
This skill can be negated by Charisma with rank B or higher.
