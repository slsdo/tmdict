At first I just drew him as a human with his eyes hidden under a crown. But then I was told “it’s ok if you go crazy enough that people might think it’s too far”, so I was able to create something very close to what I envisioned. I keep getting asked where his eyes are, to which all I can answer is that he’s looking at you from the deep darkness. (danciao)
