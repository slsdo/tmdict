Hey, please notice the exposed triangular area just under the nape of his neck from his initial~2nd Ascension stages! And then there’s the super-problematic issue about the golden armour. I started from the place of ‘How can he not overlap with the Servants who have characters that already stand out?’

“Trans–form! Are you waiting for the issue of a moveable Chogokin{{n1}} toy? Either way, its leg guards are somewhat loose as they’re a hindrance even when I’m sprinting, but it seems it’s not a problem if they aren’t attached in the first place, yeah?” That’s what one who’s full of themselves because of their youth would say. But that’s fine. (Konoe Ototsugu)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Chogokin is Japanese for “Superalloy”, which is a fictional metal in the Mazinger Z series, and it later became the name for a series of die-cast metal robots and character toys. What’s being mentioned here is two-fold in its meaning: Achilles wanted to remove the leg guards for practical reasons when he’s actually running, as well as for his Chogokin toy version in order to make it more mobile.
