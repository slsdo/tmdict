Troias Tragoidia (Troy’s Tragedy). A three-horse chariot. Two of the horses are immortal and divine horses that were bestowed to Achilles by the Sea God Poseidon, while the other one horse is a fine horse that was plundered from a city. The chariot tramples down the battleground by means of extreme speed. It can cause increased damage proportional to the rise of the chariot’s velocity. At its maximum speed, it is just like a gigantic lawnmower dashing through the fields.

Dromos Kometes (Running Comet). A Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type that Achilles activates by getting off from “The Immortal Chariot of Swift Winds and Surging Waves” to stand on his feet. It is something that embodies the legend that he is the swiftest among all heroes of all eras. He can run through a vast battlefield in a single breath, and even if there are obstacles on the field, they will not reduce his speed. He must expose his weak point, his Achilles tendon, while running, but there are few Heroic Spirits who can catch hold of him while he is running at this speed.

Andreios Amarantos (The Brave and Everlasting One). A blessing of immortality given to Achilles by his mother – the goddess Thetis – that covers his entire body except one of his heels. It also invalidates any kind of attack done to him, but this ability can be negated by those who possess the personal Skill “Divinity”.

### Diatrekhon Aster Lonkhe: Spearhead of the Star Dashing Through the Skies

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>B+</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Range</td><td>2~10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>1 person</td></tr>

Diatrekhon Aster Lonkhe (Shooting Star Spear). A Noble Phantasm that becomes available by having Achilles getting off from “The Immortal Chariot of Swift Winds and Surging Waves”. A long spear given to Achilles’ parents during the occasion of their marriage by Chiron. A Great Magecraft that is comparable to a Reality Marble, it builds up an area that has the purpose of conducting duels with fellow heroes, but only in the case that Achilles’ opponent has consented to the duel.

Because Achilles was not summoned as a Lancer, the spear has lost some of its abilities, such as a curse of incurability on the wounds it inflicts.

### Akhilleus Kosmos: The Miniature World Enclosed by the Azure Sky

  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>A+</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Barrier Noble Phantasm</td></tr>

Akhilleus Kosmos (Achilles’ World). A defensive Barrier Noble Phantasm that is comparable to “The Seven Rings that Cover the Fiery Heavens”. A shield constructed by Hephaestus, the God of Blacksmiths. The very world seen by Achilles is projected, and the ocean currents whirling at some parts of the outer circumference are due to the Sea God. To oppose this shield is, in other words, to take on the world, and if it is invoked, it can defend even against Anti-Fortress and Anti-Country Noble Phantasms.
