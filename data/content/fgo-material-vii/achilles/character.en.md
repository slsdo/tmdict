### Personality

A man with a character that is broadminded and indeed hero-like. Naivety remains somewhere within this good-natured older brother. Achilles has a flaw where he is lenient towards those who he has particularly recognized as his friends and allies, and on occasions where they return to him as enemies, he will not even attack them initially.

In other Holy Grail Wars, this flaw can be exploited, and Achilles can be cornered into a disadvantage as a result. (Generally in those cases, he will try to strike back with all his might.)

Furthermore, it is a matter of grave concern that Achilles can suffer an unexpected defeat because of that naivety. He is perfect as a hero, but he has many flaws as a human being, so for those reasons, he is a hero that is loved and can befriended by anybody.

### Attitude towards Master

Achilles basically recognizes his Master as an equal. When speaking of this conversely, he will also not approve of being seen by his Master as someone lower them. He will not change his attitude and would try to be easygoing, and if his Master is a good person, he would drink alcohol together with them and with pleasure, but if his Master is a bad person, he would try to draw a line in socializing with them.

In any event, Achilles will not go against his way as a hero————and would absolutely not follow orders such as killing unfortunate people for example.

Achilles extremely hates conducts that are uncharacteristic of a hero. With that sort of implication, it can be said that his compatibility with a so-called ‘normal mage’ is remarkably bad.

### Dialogue Examples

“You, I can tell you drew a nice Servant! With that being said, I’m Achilles, a Rider Servant… Yeah, yeah, I’m a well-known hero whose heel is his weak point. But come on, it’s not like there’s anyone that can catch hold of my heel! I can tell you that it’s not just for show that these are humanity’s fastest pair of feet, yeah?”
“————Come! Let me etch into you what it means to be a true hero, a true warrior!”
“Xanthus! Balius! Pedasos! Let’s go!! I’ll put my life on the line and run swiftly! My life’s like a shooting star! Troias Tragodia! Hahahahahaha!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A hero who boasts one of the most outstanding popularity in Greek mythology. That life ran through everything like a gale, while simultaneously, it is tinged with a brilliance that is appropriate for one who is called a hero.

It is said that when he was asked by his mother whether he desired an ordinary and peaceful life or a life where he dies as a relentless hero, Achilles chose the latter without hesitating.

According to the remaining pieces of his legend, the name of the human body part, the Achilles tendon, was the sole weak point of Achilles, who possesses an immortal body.

Achilles, who was born between the hero Peleus and the goddess Thetis, was roasted by the flames of immortality that were meant for the benefit of the gods by Thetis’ hands, but Peleus opposed that, saying that half of him is human, so she should leave that portion of him as a human.

Peleus and Thetis parted ways after this dispute, and the portion of Achilles that was left behind as those of a human’s was only the part of one of his ankles that was gripped by Thetis during the immortality process. (There is also another view where he acquired the power of immortality by being submerged underneath one of the rivers of the Underworld.)

Peleus was unable to raise Achilles, so he entrusted him to Chiron, the Sage of the Centaurs. Chiron, having raised Heracles, Jason, and many others, trained Achilles, and before long, Achilles grew up into a masculine young man.

When Achilles was asked by his mother, Thetis, whether he desired to live as an ordinary human but with a long life, or whether he desired to live as a hero – even though it would be short lived, he chose the latter without hesitating.

Participating in the Trojan War as part of the Achaean army, Achilles violently killed the heroes of the Trojan army one by one, before eventually challenging their supreme commander, Hector, to a duel, and triumphing in it.

However, Paris, Hector’s younger brother, borrowed the power of the Sun God Apollo, who was Troy’s ally, to shoot through Achilles’ heel, his sole weak point, thus stripping him of his immortality.

Furthermore, Achilles, whose heart was pierced, died after he rampaged until he was no longer able to. After his death, his once fellow allies competed for his armour he left behind.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A wild hero who tends to be bright and spontaneous. Perhaps because Achilles desires to live and die as a hero, the part of his heroic manner that is being emphasized is the part of him being majestic in his heroism rather than how unprecedented he would be.

Because of that nature, one cannot also deny the part of him that is lacking in delicacy to some extent, thus Achilles also often loses sight of the important things.

But still, Achilles’ way of life of always trying to be a proper hero is dazzlingly noble. Perhaps it is the makings of a hero that he possessed since birth, but just being next to him is heartening.

### General Armaments

His spear, and his bare hands when empty-handed.

### Connections with Characters

#### Atalanta

They were on a common front in another Holy Grail War. A woman that his father Peleus admired, and Achilles also adores Atalanta like she was family to him.

#### Semiramis

“Heeey, hanging out around you while you’re getting irritated is a somewhat pleasant atmosphere!” (Achilles was then tragically attacked by the Hanging Gardens.)

#### Heracles

“I wanted to try to have a bare-handed brawl with him just once since it sounds nice, but I was held back by everybody.”

#### Chiron

“Uwa, Teacher! No, because I’m already a graduate! Pardon me for a moment on the hard course! Ah, hey! Since Jason’s here now, I’ll go over there!”

#### Odysseus

“The dandy with the steel suit came! Soooo, do you also have your wooden horse with you!?”

#### Paris

“… The Paris I know of was a youngster who only grew up a little bit and was a little hateful, but…”

#### Hector

Achilles has complicated feelings about Hector, but he does not intend to bring those with him while in Chaldea. If he leaves out the emotional things, he sees him as… a person who can be respected as a warrior. Unfortunately, it is impossible for Achilles to leave out the emotional things in the first place.

In this connection, Hector can completely separate his emotions during battle. For example, even if he is an enemy to his parents and siblings, it seems he can suppress his emotions and carry through with the battle.

#### Penthesilea

Achilles feels some responsibility as one would expect, the kind of responsibility where he will fight Penthesilea while she is screaming out his name, but————just because he feels some responsibility, it is not like he can pick a fight with her for that reason. He was merely driven by an unbearable feeling to say that word.

#### Iskandar

“Reverence for me!? An autograph!? Mine’s!? While you’re at it, you also want my armour!? No, well, but it’s fine! Hey, no, that’s not fine!”
