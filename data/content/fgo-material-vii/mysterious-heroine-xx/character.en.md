### Personality · Setting

『Mysterious Heroine X』is, in a few words, the protagonist of a comedy drama.
X, who subtracted the serious elements from Artoria-san, acts in the shortest · fastest · simplest way for everything.
Contrary to her cheerful and polite conduit, she’s a very sore loser (since she’s not aware of it, her sense to read the mood is horrible) and will challenge you to anything, and she has a troublesome character that won’t give up until winning.
But since she “works for the sake of the surroundings in the end” due to her good nature, it worked well.

But.
The Servant Universe came to a standstill too, and the hero-villain ratio collapsed due to the reckless firing of extra classes. When the heavenly scales of the Universe leaned towards the villains, X renewed her feelings.
Being specific, the program entered a new series.
X, who was in trouble for being unemployed, found a job at the secret society: the Galactic Police with the introduction of a certain Archer, and caught by accident the oldest artifact of the Universe: Rhongomyniad, which was sleeping at its center. Her talent was acknowledged, and she was appointed as a Universe defender{{n1}} (Galaxian).

X thought 「This is a good chance」, and changed her name · family register to XX.
Having turned into a different person she trampled down all her debts until now,
and established the Special investigation Division 0 to enforce Foreigners, invaders from the Outer Universe.
The birth of the Evil God Hunter: XX.
Her instinct as a Saber Hunter has faded, and her instinct as a Foreigner Hunter stands out. That said it’s not as if she gave up the Saber elimination movement, so her special attack against Sabers is unchanged.

### Attitude towards Master

A partner at Earth. A reliable wallet.
XX’s love skills are nearly zero so there’s a sensation of friendship, but she realizes before long that they’re an important person, she makes mistakes like 「This throbbing in my chest… Could the evil god of Sabers be in this planet?!」 and misses her chance.

### Dialogue Examples

She’s basically the same as X, but since she’s self-conscious (highly aware) of being a detective she behaves more like an older sister than X. Since it’s a series a few years after X, there’s the sensation of an OL tired of her life.

「Code-name XX, reporting for work! Yes!」

「Crush… Sabafes!」

「I mean… My identity was already found out… I didn’t prattle as I wanted… Secret talk during missions is strictly prohibited, so I used that low IQ speech」

「What with horror, that’s creepy! It’s decided that the best genre is sci-fi! I’ll prove it!
O’ spear of the farthest ends, your light here! Now seal the evil god, and bring the righteous [order]{Big Bang} in this sector!」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Appears in 2018’s summer event 『Servant Summer Festival!』.
In the early scenario, she descends as a Foreigner of unknown identity in Waikiki Street, and destroys as much as possible.
She seemed to be 『a new Foreigner observed by Chaldea』due to her outer appearance, machine voice, and her battle style in which conversation couldn’t be established at all, which made her only be seen as a mecha, but her identity was a special detective from the Galactic Police that had been dispatched to hunt Foreigner BB (Swimsuit), who tried to separate the Hawaiian archipelago from ordinary space and put it 『outside the Universe』, where nobody could intervene.
She is Heroin X from after some years, and XX alone knows that.
X washes XX away with a 「For some reason or another there’s a sense of familiarity but she’s unrelated to me」, and doesn’t realize she’s her future form.

### General Armaments

Rhongomyniad spear style, a deed that doesn’t fear even God.
It’s a twin lancer style in which, when using the spear of light, the spear of darkness in the opposite side generates a backfire, and the opposite when using the spear of darkness.

### Connections with Characters

#### Mysterious Heroine X

A Saber hiding infinite possibilities! There are some subtle differences with the me that is in my memories, but that’s a Universe-like plot hole{{n2}}. With the remake and different narrator (director), the episodes subtly change… As they please?!

#### Mysterious Heroine X-A

…The resurrection flag is subtly rising… May there not be Mysterious Heroines A to Z…

#### BB (Swimsuit)

The first on the list of illegal Servants. Certainly, no matter how dangerous the event in the end she’s an ally of humanity, but… Everyone from Earth, aren’t you a bit too big hearted?

#### Odysseus

Eh… What’s with that wooden horse. Are you really a Servant from Pan-Human History?

#### Space Ishtar

And thus, the goddess of revenge became a normal Divine Spirit-type Servant. Happily ever after. Ah, but the story of the goddess isn’t over, it has to continue just a bit more.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} 防人. It’s a specific term to refer to soldiers stationed in Kyūshū in the past, or in remote regions of China during Tang dynasty, but I’m just leaving it as “defender”.
2. {{note2}} 設定齟齬. Literally “inconsistency in the setting”.
