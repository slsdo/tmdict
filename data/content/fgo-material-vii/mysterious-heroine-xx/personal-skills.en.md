### Boarding: EX{{n1}}

The protection of the Holy Spear Armor Arvalon. The armor always exists around XX’s surroundings as Spiritrons.
To the quick work that materializes · arms this in minus 1 second (even if she receives a surprise attack, she goes back in time to one second before that and equips it), she has given the name of 『Boarding』. Almost automatic.
A fearsome skill that XX, who despite being a cosmic detective tends to oversleep in the mornings and is a recidivist of being late, has learned. Just a change of clothes skill.
Actually it’s not really necessary to materialize it, it displays its function as an armor even in Spiritron shape.
The BGM changes when using it… It has a sad anecdote in which she made that specification but it was rejected because that luxury wasn’t allowed for XX alone.
「You’re a swordsman Don’t pull an Assassin Put down That unruly hair on your head」

### Instinct of the Detective: E

Revelation to determine the culprit. At a level that it’s better not to use it in case resolutions.
It generates a load of critical stars, but at the same time XX herself deals with a star concentration minus.
In some cases the demerit becomes a merit, it’s actually an excellent skill.
… She guesses the truth of the case with an 「I’ve got some insight!」, but it’s rank E so it becomes an incoherent conclusion. But that incoherent conclusion gives a revelation to the surrounding humans, and reveals the culprit after circling around. Generating a load of stars but not giving them to herself is because of this image.{{n2}}

### Justice of the Farthest Ends: A

Power from the 『boundary』 that is the forefront and farthest end of the Universe.
It’s the power to bite a hole in 『void』, and the truth that expands the Universe itself.
Adds invincibility penetration to herself, gains NP, and acquires 『special attack against Threats to Humanity』, truly a skill for the sake of a protagonist. Evil God Special Attack Artoria.
