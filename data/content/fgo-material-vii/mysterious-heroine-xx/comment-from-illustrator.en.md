XX has big changes with Ascension, and since there are almost no common parts between each Ascension design, I drew each Ascension separately. While thinking that all of the transformations are striking, so I hope everyone likes any of themâ€¦ in the end, she become a somewhat awesome character. During the work her last Ascension is the one who covers the least, but seeing her popularity the smile is the best! (BUNBUN)
