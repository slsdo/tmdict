### Riding: A

Not only can she do Cosmo-Surfing by riding the Holy Spear Armor Arvalon{{n1}} that has turned into flight form, but she can also steer the spaceship Stallion II.

### Independent Action: A

It’s unthinkable that she was a former Saber class, but she has inherited the skill she had in the class from before becoming a Foreigner without change.
「That’s because, in severe missions, cool-headed self-assessment is required at times」, she herself is convinced with a triumphant look.

### Existence Outside the Domain: D

Protection from the Farthest Ends, the extreme point at the exact opposite position of the Outer Universe.
As a result she became a Foreigner, but a Foreigner’s weakness is Foreigner so there’s no helping it. 「You throw a monster against a monster」

### Cosmo Reactor: B

The protection of the great Universe (plot armor{{n2}}) that draws towards herself victory’s principle of causality, but it has been ranked-down for being in the position of serving an organization.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} アーヴァロン, different from Avalon (アヴァロン).
2. {{note2}} 主人公補正. Literally “protagonist modifiers”, but that sounds awkward.
