### Personality

Due to the method of birth (manufacture), he was only given innocent emotions like those of a baby, but based on the abundant knowledge he was blessed with by birth, he was formed as one living being in one way or another.
He, who was motivated by one of the main objectives of living beings that is 『to survive』, gains humanity by encountering several incidents.
That was in a certain sense, an attempt to make a being that was a lifeform from a higher order be degraded into something vulgar.
Eventually he harbored anger unnecessary for a living being due to the death of a Holy Maiden, and contended for the decisive battle.
His current state was copied in a state close to the final stage, expresses emotions as it is, and shows a glimpse of a side brimming with curiosity.

### Attitude towards Master

Serving a common Master, or being summoned is rare, so there is no problem in thinking that his attitude regarding the Master is just like his attitude towards the protagonist.
He respects the Master that is fighting to protect Human Order, and will fight risking his life for his/her sake.
He, who was destined from the beginning to disappear once everything is over, doesn’t have a bit of hesitation in his disappearance.
If he was to hesitate, it would just be a separation from a partner who he deepened his bonds with.

### Dialogue Examples

「Servant… Sieg. I apologize, I’m just a homunculus.
I think you can’t expect much of me as military strength, but it seems that if it’s with my registered Noble Phantasm I can somehow fight. Use me as you deem fit.」
「Transformation start.
My body is the evil dragon that flies embracing the Chalice of Heaven.
Melt everything… Ákafiloga Allgríðr!」
「… Master. Er, it would make me happy if you became my friend.
I don’t know if this is a way to invite you or not but
… No, forget it.
It’s awkward」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

What if someone extended their hand towards an unreachable star while gritting their teeth.
He was in the side that shot down that star.
He is just a homunculus, just a human.
Formerly a homunculus of the Musik family ———— He who was cast for the use of mana supply, was chosen by Avicebron as a candidate for the nucleus of his Noble Phantasm, but he escaped in fear of that fact.
After many twists and turns, the homunculus that went by the name of Sieg obtained the omnipotent wish-granting device, and flew away to the Reverse Side of the World in the form of Fafnir.
……Now, the Sieg summoned in Chaldea is a terminal distributed from there.
The main body has almost the same thoughts and performance, but only the accumulated experience is different.
That said, that’s a life allowed only in the circumstances in which Human Order is trembling.
While finding out the meaning of living a different life from the main body separated far away, he will someday disappear as if he was dreaming.

### Connections with Characters

#### Jeanne D’arc

I see. Ruler being here is a natural logic.
It’s not like she will remember me, but I can’t help but carelessly call out to her.

#### Jeanne D’arc (Alter)

Another aspect of that Ruler…?
It’s hard to believe, but there are many things with this situation.
And the outside may be different, but her being too serious at the core feels like Ruler.
No, the class is Avenger, though.

Servants that participated in the Great Holy Grail War
Everyone is a splendid hero.
Though only a little, I’m proud of having been able to fight.

#### Astolfo

Rider is Rider anywhere.
Um, I’m glad.

#### Sitonai

Summarizing you’re a homunculus, Sitonai, Freyja, and Louhi.
I see, how complicated.
…Me too in general?
I’m a homunculus, temporarily borrow Siegfried’s power, can transform into Fafnir,
and I’m a fragment of a former Master?
…How complicated…

#### Jeanne D’arc (Swimsuit)

(Doubts his own eyes, rubs them)

#### Jeanne D’arc (Alter) (Swimsuit)

Japanese swords, three-sword style…
(Nods with satisfaction)
