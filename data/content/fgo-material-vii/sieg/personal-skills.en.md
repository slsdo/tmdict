### Man-Made Hero (Fake): B+
A man-made pseudo-hero created by receiving the heart of the hero Siegfried and having Frankenstein’s Noble Phantasm electric current flowing inside his body. Though it’s only for a short time, by combining it with a Dragon Revelation Command Spell he can act as a hero ———— a Servant.

### Magecraft: C

Natural talent that homunculi, cast from Magic Circuits, have.
Makes use of a technique style that understands the structure of the target and destroys any solid material by striking with the completely opposite composition. However, Sieg can’t use any magecraft at all besides that.

### Dragon Revelation Command Spells: EX

Dead Count Shapeshifter.
By using the Command Spells he owns, he makes use of the inserted heart of Siegfried although temporarily, and can transform into Siegfried.
A super-unique skill that is impossible to be possessed by others that aren’t the homunculus Sieg.
