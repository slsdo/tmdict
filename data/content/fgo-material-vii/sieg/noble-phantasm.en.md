Ákafiloga Allgríðr.{{n1}}
A Noble Phantasm that brings a temporary figure transformation into the Dragn Kind “Fafnir”.
By emitting a powerful Breath of the Dragon (dragon breath), it deals immense damage.
Fundamentally he returns to normal once he finishes breathing, but if it’s for a short time things such as flight in the shape of a dragon are possible too.
