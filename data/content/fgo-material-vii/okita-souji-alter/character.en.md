### Personality

A Decisive Battle Heroic Spirit tailored to shine only one time.
Majin – Okita Souji, aka Demon God – Okita Souji Alternative.

A separate aspect of Okita Souji. She is an extremely special Heroic Spirit with a Saint Graph changed and tailored to exercise the Counter Force’s might.
Since she was tailored under goal of manifesting only once, everything besides the Saint Graph’s essentials was altered to a level where she became so different from her base (Okita’s Saint Graph) that some can’t consider her the same. That’s also why she was summoned as an Alter Ego instead of in Okita’s most suitable Class, Saber.

A potential final state Okita Souji could have attained had her not passed away too young.

### Attitude towards Master

She was not supposed to get a Master, only to manifest as a Counter Guardian once and disappear, so she’s very emotionally attached to the one who basically enabled her connection to the world.
It’s unknown whether or not she understands or not what exactly this means.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am the slasher of demons, the piercer of gods, the ensemble of human prayer.”
“Through the light of infinity which pierces the myriad ksetra, I sever your karma. Zekken! Mukyuu Sandan!”
“I love oden. The chikuwabu is the most delicious part. Yummy yummy.”
“Great victory for Majin-san! Was that it?”
“Majin-san Beam!”
“…Thank you.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The swordmaster group Shinsengumi became legendary in the Bakumatsu period, and Okita Souji was said to be strongest among them. And she is an alter ego of Okita Souji.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A being that earned its Saint Graph because during Okita Souji’s childhood, when she was at the verge of death, Okita’s sister prayed to all deities and sealed the agreement to forfeit her to the world, once.
Since she was tailored to the purpose of manifesting only once and either annihilating her target or going down with them, she’s lacking in human emotions unnecessary for combat. That’s most likely why she often reacts to things like a child would.

Her combat style mostly takes Okita’s as its base, but she has her own unique additions, including a Magic Resistance rank high enough for someone made under the premise of fighting against the supernatural and an area-of-effect attack for annihilation purposes.
On the heat of battle, she tried throwing her sword once, but she learned not to do that because it angered Purgatory. But she still sometimes forgets and throws it. She’s the Okita Souji that can shoot beams.

“I was supposed to have been born for one single manifestation, but for unexplained reasons, I lived for what could be described as an eternity and, as you can see, I still remain here under the inwilken skies. Now my memories and Saint Graph already worn out to the point where I can’t even recognize their face, but my feelings at that moment and at that place will always remain as a warm light forever in my heart.

This is very dear to me.”

### General Armaments

### Connections with Characters

#### Okita Souji:
She is her original, but they are alter egos so terribly distant that their Saint Graph almost count as different people.

#### Oda Nobunaga

Majin is quite grateful to Nobunaga, for often giving her good sweets and for being the one to name Purgatory.

#### Lady Chacha

Because Chacha was always taking taking care of Majin, she loves her as a mother. Chacha doesn’t really gets why Majin always makes a point to add the “Lady” to her name, but she doesn’t mind.

#### Hijikata Toshizou

She actually doesn’t remember Hijikata all that well, but she sees “Hijimi” as a gentle guy.

#### Sakamoto Ryouma

They could be considered coworkers, but their employment status is supposedly quite different.

#### Okada Izou

Due to her inability to sense his “Get’off me” aura, she’s occasionally approaching him for conversation. They hit off better than you’d expect.

#### Nagao Kagetora

Often seen together in that odd state where you can’t tell if they are having a conversation or not.

#### Mori Nagayoshi

They occasionally go catch rhinoceros beetles together before breakfast. They also occasionally go together to farm Hearts.
