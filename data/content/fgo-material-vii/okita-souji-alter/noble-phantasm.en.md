Zekken · Mukyuu Sandan.
Incalculable, indisturbable, infinite. These three traits combined form the trait of inwelkin.
The Demon God Okita Souji’s finisher “magic sword”, releasing a radiant dark light.
It’s able to annihilate or remove from the world what was not supposed to exist, or even what cannot be allowed to exist.
It is shot using a special oodachi, the Purgatory Sword.

The oodachi is actually a nameless armament we don’t have a clue what’s supposed to be, and Purgatory is just a random name assigned to it just because. For whatever reason, it seems to have something akin to autonomous thought and its effectiveness varies greatly according to how it’s feeling about the user. When in a good mood, the center of the blade glows red. It’s implied to be relative fond of its name Purgatory.
