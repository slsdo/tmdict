Who would have thought she was such an airhead characterâ€¦
The concept for the first Ascension is a dark, Gundam MK-2-like Okita. The second Ascension is a what-if scenario for where she fought on the Goryoukaku. And the third Ascension is her final battle mode as a Counter Guardian. Purgatory, her sword taller than herself, was designed by Shimaudon. (Takeuchi Takashi)
