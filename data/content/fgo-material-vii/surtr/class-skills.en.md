### Magic Resistance: EX

He completely nullifies most harmful magecraft effects.

### Riding: -

It’s something he has when he gained the Saint Graph of a Saber by interfering with the contract with Opheliea, but he discarded the Riding Skill, as it is “unnecessary” for him.

### Independent Action: EX

He’s able to accomplish incinerating all land on Earth without receiving a mana supply.

### Territory Creation: EX

He expands his own territory by heating the ground with each step.

### Beast of the War Dead: A+

A Skill that uses the power he absorbed from Fenrir. The performance of Surtr’s original super effectiveness against gods is increased even further. (Only in his second form)
