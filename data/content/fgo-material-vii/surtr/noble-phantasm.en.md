Lævateinn​.
A syncretism between the sword of flames regarded as Surtr’s armament, the sword of the sun owned by Goddess Freyr and the arms forged by the Scandinavian God Loki. Surtr’s wife Sinmara safeguarded sword Lævateinn in legend​ by applying nine seals upon it. It is armament for giants, an armament for gods, and invitation to destruction. Super effective against gods and life.
