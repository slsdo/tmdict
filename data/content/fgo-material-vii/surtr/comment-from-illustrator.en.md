A Flaming Titan with a black shell. I put emphasis on him being good-looking by making him slimmer than the rest of the Ancient Giants, given that he’s Norse Mythology’s final boss. In the initial drafts, I designed him all the way down to his legs, but, tragically, everything from the waist down was cut to fit the screen. But he deserved it because he was cruel to his Master y’know. Learn your lesson. I like how putting him next to an Ifrit makes them look like father and daughter. Kehe. (Shaka P/DELiGHTWORKS)
