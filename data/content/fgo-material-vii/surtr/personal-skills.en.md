### Monstrous Strength: B+++

It’s a skill that represents his destructive nature as a world-ending giant. The 「+++」is some kind of bug that shouldn’t fall within the framework of his Saint Graph.

### Giant’s Shell: A

The hardened shell that composes the Ancient Giants’ bodies. As he has an extremely special composition, he absorbs offensive energy and converts it to mana. He can’t do the mana conversion for attacks that exceed the absorption limit (normal attacks and Noble Phantasm attacks over a certain rank), leading him to take full damage.

### Branch Destruction: A++

Surtr’s flames described in the「Prophecy of the Priestess」. It is the highest ranked Mana Burst while in the form of his flames, while at the same time it is an armor that deals with physical attacks and all temperature changes, and also an armament that cleanses any abnormal effect surrounding him. A kind of Noble Phantasm, but It’s presented as a Skill in the game.

### Niflheimr’s Wind: B

A blizzard of absolute zero that comes from the world of ice and frost that Fenrir once ate. This is not used within FGO.
