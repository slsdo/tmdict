A blazing giant appearing in Norse Mythology. A dark being.
A representative of the giants living in Muspelheim, a world of flame. In Ragnarok, Scandinavia’s endgame war, he is the one to burn in flames. It can be said that his character was inspired by a volcano and its eruptions.

The doomsday device was born to provide the extinction of all life. The Primordial Titan (Ymir)’s destructive nature is not recorded in the Pan-Human History’s legends. The person that mostly inherited it all is Surtr.

A being from Lost History.
Establishing disaster at the core of the Scandinavian Lostbelt’s world. In the Age of Gods, he ate Fenrir, the giant wolf who beared the same destruction as himself, and he decided to deviate from the pre-established Ragnarok (the one identical with Pan-Human History), so he attempted to burn the entire planet instead of only Scandinavia. It’s possible to say that deed was the first step to a pruning phenomenon without a future. However, when he was about to start the planet’s incineration, he was met with opposition from the gods ,starting with the Almighty Odin. The battle ended with no winner, as Surtr managed to annihilate them all but his body was sealed inside a 「false sun」. That world was supposed to have been pruned right there, but…

Surtr plans the「planet’s incineration」once again with the world existing as a Lostbelt. In the beginning he concealed his true form inside of the Heroic Spirit Sigurd; replaced his personality, accept Ophelia as his master; behaving as Scandinavia’s strongest knights wielding the demonic sword Gram, but--------- In the end he reveals his true self, he merges with the 「fake sun」floating in the skies of Scandinavia. He takes the form as the enormous flaming titan and plans the greater doomsday that surpasses the past doomsday… the incineration of all landmass on Earth.

### Feelings towards Ophelia

Surtr was slowly torturing Ophelia emotionally while he was behaving as the knight Sigurd. He grilled her inside. However, he would never destroy her. In decisive situations------situations were Ophelia would be broken if he tormented her---------, Surtr respected Ophelia’s orders. That is because he seriously loves Ophelia in his own way.

Surtr has only one reason clinging onto Ophelia. When he failed his role as a doomsday device and got secluded in the grey world, she was the woman who 「found」 him. Although he fears this was mere coincidence, that encounter was the first element of unpredictability in Surtr’s entire life--------the「love」known as surprise. While Surtr tried to achieve the role of destroying the world, he clings to Ophelia to the very end, to show the end of the world to the 「foolish woman」(to make her survive it). Harboring gratitude, getting emotional, wanting to repay a favor. That’s called「love」, but Surtr didn’t know that.
