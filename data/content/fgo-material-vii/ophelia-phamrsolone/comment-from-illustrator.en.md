Since she was a tragedy heroine, I tried to imagine a character that would look more beautiful than ever on the moment she died. From the character profile I received, I wondered if her character would be in a constant mental breakdown, but in the actual story she was written as quite calm. Well done, Ophelia. One of the suggestions in the commission was “gothic clothes” and I still kinda want to draw that. (La-na)
