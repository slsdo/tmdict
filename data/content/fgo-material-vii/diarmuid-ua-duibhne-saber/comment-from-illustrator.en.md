As he was said to be a Saber with paired swords, I at least did his image and design with a nimble look to them. In addition, I added to him armour, which plays a role in his appearance so that he appears like a swordsman. Even though I was nervous in being able to take and be entrusted with a handsome character like Diarmuid, I remembered that I drew him while silently praying to myself, “Become a handsome man~~ Become a handsome man~~!” However, although I assuredly drew him in advance by myself, the impression that Diarmuid and his Saint Graph is slightly at a distance from me is indeed there, and I even slowly came to ridicule myself for that.
