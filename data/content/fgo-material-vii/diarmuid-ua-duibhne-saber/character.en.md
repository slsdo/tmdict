### Personality

A noble Heroic Spirit who is fervent with loyalty and endowed with faithfulness. Although Diarmuid is basically the same person as when he was a Lancer, his self-awareness as a “knight” has particularly gotten stronger when he was summoned as a Saber. He enjoys battling formidable enemies and is not afraid of what others may think of himself in pursuing such things. Whether he is aware of it or not, his self-esteem is somewhat stronger when compared to the times where he was a Lancer.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Basically the same as when Diarmuid was a Lancer.

Even regarding the Holy Grail, Diarmuid does not intend to use it for himself from the way it seems. In the case that he obtained the Holy Grail in battle, he would have the intention of presenting it to his master as his supreme goal.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Saber. Knight of the Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. Allow me to serve you as a knight.”
“It’s disappointing, but whether I’m equipped with swords or with spears, I’m a hero who will surely be serviceable to you. The likes of a field I’m not very good at doesn’t exist for me.”
“Master. I shall devote this battle to you.”
“Let’s depart now, in accordance with chivalry.”
“Ah… O’ Knight King. I want to be a witness to you once more…”

### Character Image

A robust knight who makes free use of two magic spears and two magic swords. A peerless handsome man who was raised by the Fairy King and God of Love Aengus and the Sea God Manannán. Diarmuid Ua Duibhne was the best knight among the Knights of the Fianna whom were led by Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is said that he greatly played an active role in the united front between the knight order and the Fairy King Abarta. The tale of the blighted love between him and Princess Gráinne was even said to have become the model for the later tale of Lancelot and Guinevere.

On this occasion, Diarmuid has further materialized with the Saint Graph of a Saber. This is because he considers not only spears but also swords as his strong points, and yet… in this Saint Graph, his aspect as a “mythological/legendary hero” has been strongly emphasized, so perhaps since he possesses several Noble Phantasms that were owned by the gods, the cost/difficulty level regarding his summoning is higher when compared to the case where he is summoned as a Lancer. (Still, if specific conditions are not satisfied for his Saint Graph, it would not be established and will end up vanishing like mist.)

Diarmuid’s Noble Phantasms are the twin magic swords Móralltach and Beagalltach. During the times he was a Lancer, he also possessed Skills that were apparently sealed. In legends, it is said that Diarmuid chose to equip himself with one magic spear and one magic sword at a time, but just like how he was equipped with “paired spears” as a Lancer, he got “paired swords” with him as a Saber. Once he is summoned, there is no doubt that he will flourish as a powerful knight of the “two-sword style”.

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria (Especially Saber Artoria)

Saber Diarmuid is delighted to meet with the Knight King again. Seeing that there are no legends in Pan-Human History where the Knight King and Diarmuid – the Chief Knight of the Fianna – encountered each other, one can conjecture that they have met in some Holy Grail War. Although they do not speak of the details… Saber Diarmuid dreams and smiles of the day where they can cross swords once more.

#### Miyamoto Musashi

Diarmuid is quite aware of Musashi’s existence. That is to say, is the reason because they are both dual blade wielders as one would expect?… Or perhaps… Is it because Diarmuid is experiencing over again the fate of a man being picked up by a woman?…

#### Cú Chulainn

A companion Diarmuid reveres. For the best master of swordsmanship among the Knights of the Fianna, it seems the existence of the great Celtic hero from a different Cycle is about to be on his mind.

#### Fionn mac Cumhaill

A companion Diarmuid once served. Since he is strongly self-aware that he, as of now, is a Servant who serves the Master, Saber Diarmuid does not call Fionn “My Master”.

#### Yagyuu Tajima-no-Kami

A friend Diarmuid took up at Chaldea.

According to Tajima-no-Kami, he recalls his seven sons from his early years whenever he looks at Diarmuid.
