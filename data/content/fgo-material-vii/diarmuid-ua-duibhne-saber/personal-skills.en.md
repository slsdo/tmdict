### Magical Burst (Jump): A

Having been raised by the gods, Diarmuid acquired superhuman jumping power. Having materialized as a Saber, he possesses this Skill in exchange for his Agility Parameter being lower when compared to the case where he is a Lancer. By emitting magical energy, his mobility explosively rises, raising his overall offensive power as a result.

### Honour of the Knight of the Fianna: B

Diarmuid’s incomparable resolve. The unwavering mentality of a chief knight given shape.

### Rippling Waves of Passion：B+

Beagalltach.
A skill from the second Noble Phantasm.

### Love Spot: B

Seduces those of the user’s opposite sex by means of a beauty spot tinged with magical energy.

A female who confronts Diarmuid will bear a strong feeling of love for him. Evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.

(His control over this Skill is effective under this Saint Graph in “Fate/Grand Order”.)
