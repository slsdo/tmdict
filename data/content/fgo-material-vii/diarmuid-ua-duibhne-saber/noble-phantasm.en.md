If one were to nominate the most powerful armament among the many armaments Diarmuid Ua Duibhne handles, it could be none other than this fearsome magic sword. Bringing certain death in one blow, and bringing certain victory on the first strike. This unsheathed magic sword bestows certain victory to Diarmuid and brings about defeat and death to his opponent.

This sword, as if it can manipulate even fate, was gifted to Diarmuid by Manannán{{n1}}, who was to the Celts the God of the Sea and the Otherworld. Manannán was surely the deity who bestowed Noble Phantasms such as Fragarach to the Sun God Lugh and an existence who owned and offered Noble Phantasms in great numbers.

After making use of a super jump that goes beyond human understanding, which became apparent due to his materialization in the Saber Class, Diarmuid executes a falling attack at the moment of its True Name Release. At this occasion, Móralltach becomes three blades – resembling even the “legs of the god Manannán” that were spoken of in legends – and cuts the opponent to pieces.

According to anecdotes, it is said that Diarmuid would carry the magic sword Móralltach and the magic spear Gáe Dearg when betaking himself to adventures where life and death truly hung in the balance, and in cases where he judged the danger of the trip to be little, he would take the magic sword Beagalltach and the magic spear Gáe Buidhe.

————When Diarmuid died, the equipment he had been carrying was the latter set.
If Diarmuid went into the mountains with the former set of equipment, the demon boar would have been killed, and he might have lived a long life.

A defensive Noble Phantasm. One of the armaments gifted to Diarmuid by the Sea God Manannán. It takes the form of a short sword. Diarmuid uses this sword not as his main weapon, but as his sub-weapon. It is a defensive Noble Phantasm that increases Diarmuid’s own defensive power, while simultaneously, it raises his overall combat performance when he handles it alongside his First Noble Phantasm – the magic sword Móralltach.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} According to the common versions of the myth, Manannán actually gave Móralltach and Beagalltach to Aengus, who then gave them to Diarmuid.
