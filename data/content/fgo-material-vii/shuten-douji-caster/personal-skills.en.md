### Oni of Dharmapāla{{n1}} · Heart Clutch Kill: A+

Heart Break.
Together with the class change, her Noble Phantasm that pulls out the bones of the target 『Profuse Blooming · My Intimacy (Bone Collector)』{{n2}} has been turned into a skill.
A fearsome special move in which she shoves her hand into the body of the target that fails a resistance check, and mercilessly crushes the important organs starting from the heart.
The skill granted to Dharmapāla Girl in order to control oni… is how it’s professed to be, but won’t most creatures be silent{{n3}} if you crush their heart? It is said to the question of the dubious Chaldea personnel, Shuten Dōji just laughed pleasantly and didn’t answer.

### Oni of Dharmapāla · Strike Kill Rod: B

Break Rod.
「The princess in that tee-vee box, y’know. She was swinging around a queer stick, all sparkly~. I want that too」
「Leave it to me」
She had this conversation with the familiar Haku or something like that.

### Oni-Kind Demon (Rescue): A

The base skill that represents the unusual power of the oni and represents the Phantasmal Species has been altered for this time.
A composite skill comprising the skills Natural Demon, Monstrous Strength, Charisma, Mana Burst, etc., but its effects have been regulated in this work.
A skill that gives a special attack and special defense against the Oni Kind and its analogues.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} A type of wrathful god in Buddhism. Its name literally means “defender of Dharma (the Law)”. In Japanese it’s written [護法]{gohō} to make a pun with [魔法少女]{mahō shōjo} (magical girl).
2. {{note2}} 百花繚乱・我愛称. 百花繚乱 can refer to either flowers blooming or a gathering of many beautiful women. At the same time, 愛称 can be “nickname” or “intimacy”. I suppose that the message the NP’s name tries to convey is something like a private harem, but the result is a bit awkward.
3. {{note3}} 沈黙 usually refers to simply being silent, but here it’s more like being silent because you’re dead.
