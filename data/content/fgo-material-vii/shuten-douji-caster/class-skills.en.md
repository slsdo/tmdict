### Item Construction: B

Can create new outfits or tools in order to rise her ability depending on the season.
Seems so, but it isn’t used much.

### Territory Creation: B

「Appearing in high places」
「Hearing her voice but not seeing her」
There are rumors about such stagings actually being done by putting her Territory Creation skill to use.

### Divinity: C

The child of Yamata no Orochi = Kuzuryū.{{n1}}
Because she’s fallen as an oni, the rank has dropped.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Kuzuryū was an evil dragon who was offered human sacrifices to be appeased, similar to the Yamata no Orochi. But rather than being killed, it was tied to an underwater rock formation by a priest called Mankan, and ended up being worshiped as Kuzuryū Daimyōjin. The legend also includes Mankan witnessing the dragon turn into a Dragon King and building a shrine for it.
