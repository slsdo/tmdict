At the beginning the design had long pigtails but thinking that would be too much, it turned into now’s hairstyle. Oni and magical girls and Japanese style and Halloween, there were many various elements and I have memory of how hard it was to put them together. The result, I think she’s hot with lots of exposure as it’s typical of Shuten-chan and she became the Onicure{{n1}} Ibaraki-chan admires, but how is it? Looking really closely I drew hearts in many places, and the eyebrows in particular may be difficult to understand… (Honjō Raita)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Written as 鬼救阿 (Oni Rescue Shade). It reads the same as オニキューア (Onicure). Obvious reference to Precure, one of the most known magical girl anime. Speaking of that, Yūki Aoi (besides vocing Madoka) will also have a leading role in ​the latest season of Precure that will start airing on February.
