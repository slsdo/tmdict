Gohō Shōjo · Kuzuryū Ōsatsu.
A phantasmagorical battering unleashed by combining the strong body and physical performance as an oni with her natural elegance and cruelty.
Specifically, she hits and kicks through super-high speed movement that could be mistaken by teleportation.
It has a short range, but evasion is nearly impossible. Punching and kicking that defeats even the protections of Divinity.
Opponents usually die here.
After the beating, she fires the poisoned sake of her Noble Phantasm 『Multitude of Colors · Providential Oni Poison』 from her large gourd, but ——— this is 「an extra」, 「something to cheer things up」 for Shuten, so in the end the attack’s core is the bashing.
