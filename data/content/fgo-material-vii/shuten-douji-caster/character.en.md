### Personality

Exactly the same as the Shuten Dōji with an Assassin Saint Graph, but ————
She… at least seems to be careful not to destroy Ibaraki Dōji’s dreamed image of 「Dharmapāla Girl」 …?
It may be accurate that it represents how ‘Tis somehow like dancing a kagura so it’s fun{{n2}}, and that she continues because it feels good.
For the time being, it seems she will stay in this outfit until she gets bored.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Exactly the same as when she’s an Assassin.

### Character Image

Ibaraki 「In Hinomoto’s{{n3}} TV, look, there’s that on Sundays on TV. Couldn’t that by any chance be derived from Shuten? Beautiful, strong… Just like an oni!」
Hah, right.
…Well, there was something similar among oni.

<>

It’s uncertain whether that existed in the world of the Heian era.
It’s also unknown if it’s something whose word was sent among the oni living in the interval to the modern era of the 21st century.
But even so she speaks.
The heroes that save the world of humans become Heroic Spirits,
those who save the world of oni become Dharmapāla.
Admonishing oni, ascertaining oni, killing oni ——— The one who saves oni by doing so is the oni of Dharmapāla.

<>

Ibaraki 「Whyat?!」
My.
If you believe it, well, can’t be helped.
…Well, since it’s a dream-like story, why not leave it as such?

It looked fun so while acting as Dharmapāla Girl, the oni of Dharmapāla Ibaraki believes in, Shuten is active at Chitose, which has been turned into Oniland with the power of the Oni King (to be exact, with the power of 『The Gold of The Kamuy』{{n4}}), in order to thrust 『If you want to entertain someone it must be humans, not oni』 at the Oni King (Elisábeth JAPAN), who is too human to be an oni.{{n5}}

At the beginning she intended it to be just a disguise/masquerade, but since she’s accompanied by the small Demonic Beast「Haku」 that she caught in the vicinity of Chitose, the Saint Graph seems to have changed temporarily.
Her methods are just like those of a hero, but don’t be mistaken.
In the end what she’s acting as is the one who 『admonishes oni, kills oni, and by that saves oni』.

### Familiar

Note that the familiar 「Haku」’s true nature was the evil dragon originating from 『The Gold of Kamuy』{{n6}}, but…
The current 「Haku」is, just like the old Haku, a familiar composed by Shuten separating her own mana.
Haku won’t speak ———
Although that’s what Shuten says, there are testimonies about it saying something when nobody’s around.

### Others

She doesn’t intend to hide herself that much, but strangely enough there aren’t many people that realize 「she’s Shuten Dōji」.

### Connections with Characters

#### Ibaraki Dōji

When will she realize…?

#### Oni-type Servants

Where are the oni that pretend to be humans?
Should I knock you with my rod to discipline you?

#### Minamoto no Raikō / Sakata Kintoki / Mochidzuki Chiyome, etc.

Ne~ither, no matter how long, won’t realize it’s me.
Hah. What a let-down.
But, right. With things as they are I may play a lot.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} 旦那 can be “husband” or “master”, as many of you know.
2. {{note2}} The parts in italic are said by Shuten. Wish there was a way to put the Kansai dialect in English.
3. {{note3}} An old way of calling Japan.
4. {{note4}} I guess they’re simply referring to the gold offered to the kamuy?
5. {{note5}} This type of paragraphs full of commas are always difficult. I apologize if it’s difficult to understand what it says.
6. {{note6}} They probably mentioned it in FGO (I’m a NA pleb), but it’s probably the dragon Sitonai killed.
