### Primeval Rune

They possess Runes, a Norse Magic Crest. It differs from those used by modern mages; it’s unique as it conceals astounding power because it was from by the Almighty God. While this skill is Lancer’s skill, Valkyrie uses the mana of various combat supporters. While it might be possible to use offensive magecraft with it, they don’t use it very much because they think that the merit of combat isn’t with magecraft but with flesh and armaments.

### Swan-white Mystic Code: A

They were rewarded with swan-white clothes from the Great God Odin. (This was originally a Noble Phantasm but it was turned into a skill in Fate/Grand Order)

### Fateweaver: B

As per the 「Njals Saga」, the Valkyries are occasionally depicted weaving with terrifying looms. The girls determined the victory or defeat of the battlefield by ripping up weaved cloth.
