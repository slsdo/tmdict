Gungnir.

Weapons bestowed from the Great God Odin. A downgraded copied variant of the Declaration of the Great God (Gungnir). If its true name is released while thrown then its function will activate. (In FateGO, the true name is never released, thus it’s normally used as an ordinary weapon.)

Ragnarök Lífþrasir

Multiple Valkyries (all of them add up to 10 Valkyries) meetup in one spot perfectly synched in tandem among themselves to perform their duty of leading souls of heroes towards Valhalla, throwing their Noble Phantasm 「Declaration of the Great God ・False」in unison. While they deal damage by throwing their spears towards the target, some kind of barrier develops as an area of effect. Pure souls are met with kindness, while the existence of anything that falls short of a righteous life is outright rejected. They’ll create a space for separating beings such as Servants and familiars that have magical, demonic powers such as the existences of Phantasmal species, Vampire species, etc. (Units that fail a resist check are dispelled.)

Svanhvít.

They were rewarded with swan-white clothes from the Almighty God Odin. When the Valkyries put this on, they possess the ability to fly; it’s possible for them to maneuver at high speeds. When pegasi aren’t available, it’s not an overstatement that this Noble Phantasm is the primary contributor to Valkyrie’s mobility. However, the true value of this Noble Phantasm goes beyond enabling aviation. Its true ability is the divine protection of the Almighty God Odin - Norse Mythology’s greatest existence. Because of this, it preserves the absolute nature of Valkyrie’s mind and soul. Magecraft and abilities that could potentially affect the mind are completely repelled, and on top of deflecting physical attacks of Rank B of below, their bodies do not change even after massive intake of calories. There have been multiple anecdotes wherein their removed garments are hidden while bathing, resulting in situations like「I have to get married now….」; be careful.
