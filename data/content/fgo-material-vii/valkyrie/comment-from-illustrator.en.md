### Valkyrie

I really liked the concept of “Goddess of War” in Valkyries. Having drawn stories of Valkyries as far back as my doujin days, it’s a role that I spent a lot of effort on. As if representing the groups of Valkyries, Ortlinde who has minimal sense of self and personality; Hildr who is brimming with curiousity and vitality; Thrud as the Goddess of War with her amazing design. Being able to represent their group characteristic by utilize different voice actress at difference stages of ascension also makes me very happy. (Takeuchi Takashi)

### Valkyries that Show Up in the Noble Phantasm

These are the Valkyries that show up in the Noble Phantasm. I designed the Valkyries for a different project, but I got permission to include them here, so I had them cameo. (Takeuchi Takashi)
