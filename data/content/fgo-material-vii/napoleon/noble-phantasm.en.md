Arc de Triomphe de l’Étoile.
A bombardment type Noble Phantasm crowned with the same French name as the Triumphal Arch.
The potential of mankind (the apex) is transformed into a cannonball, flying through the sky almost like a rainbow.
Based on Heroic Spirit Napoleon’s existence itself, the Noble Phantasm sublimated the tale of the Great Sphinx of Giza’s bombardment.
Its outward appearance is that of a transforming, one-handed cannon.
Due to the story of the bombardment that “destroyed the Sphinx”, it is especially effective against Mystery.
 
Hope, humans.
Do not lose heart. Do not cast your eyes down. Do not give up.
For you, nothing is impossible.
