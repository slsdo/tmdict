I have been contacted about a dandy and coolly heroic Napoleon. At first, the cannon’s size was less than half of the current one’s, but, saying “Let’s make the cannon transform, to emphasize the silhouette even more!”, it turned into this. By the way, it was Takeuchi-san who removed the buttons on his chest in the first ascension, but seeing everyone’s reactions, I think it was a wonderful decision after all. Not showing off his muscles would be a waste, right! (Ryota-H)
