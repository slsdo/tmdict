Salieri’s eyes were originally supposed to be gold, but the color of red flames conceptually reflected upon his being and changed their color. Conversely, Amadeus’ were originally silver, but then changed to sky blue or green, something like that? In regards to the Wailing Facade, the original plan was that Amadeus had created his very own grim reaper from things he was scared of, so the broader origin of the design were the black armor that the knight captain’s ghost (who was presented as a father figure) wore in the movie, as well as the neck part of archbishop Colloredo’s clothes. I guess Salieri’s build in his third stage is closer to a bird or a dinosaur, huh. There was also a plan for Salieri to use his wings as speakers or sound amplifiers when he spread them. (PFALZ)

Salieri and the Man in Grey show up as sort of relatives or acquaintances of Amadeus, but actually the reason why Amadeus’ design is so gaudy is because his design was based on the idea of the Man in Grey. “There is a legend that Amadeus was killed by a grey reaper”, starting from that I started thinking about other things, like “grey days”, “rationalism”, “melancholy”, “not partaking in pleasure and simply living is the best choice”…all those “colorless” concepts that Amadeus would appear to oppose pretty much ended up making me design him to be flashy and needlessly gaudy. The request I got for Salieri’s human form was “a sophisticated dandy man”. So while I was at it I remember having a lot of fun designing my own unique brands for him. (PFALZ)
