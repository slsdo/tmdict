### Innocent Monster: EX

Salieri didn’t kill anyone in his past life.
But due to the rumors and legends spread all over the world about Mozart’s assassination, Antonio Salieri was bound to become an innocent monster.
The effects of this skill are somewhat different from the usual “Innocent Monster”, since it has fused with the Self-Denial skill (which is usually separate), and has become a composite skill.

### Wailing Facade: A

The shell or armor that Salieri wears as an anti-hero.
He obtained this skill from the fact that Salieri’s existence has mixed with that of the Man in Grey, the mysterious grim reaper-like figure that sometimes appears in stories about Mozart, as the one who requested him to make his Requiem in D Minor in July of 1791
During battle, Salieri will wear this armor and act as a weapon for slaughter.

### Wildfire: B

The rumors about Mozart’s assassination spread just like a curse, just like a wildfire.
The Avenger Salieri, uses the disdain, ill will, slander and demagoguery that gave birth to him, and turns it into power for himself.
Aside from weakening the psyche of the target group, it can also double as a powerful attack to the mind.
If the targets do not possess magic means of defense, it is even possible for Salieri to make them commit suicide.
