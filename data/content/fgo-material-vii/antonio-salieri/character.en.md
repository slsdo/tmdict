### Personality

An excellent Servant that obeys his Master’s every command and swiftly eliminates his targets.
No trace of human emotion or thought will interfere with his tasks.

Usually, he’s a thoughtful and cool-headed person.
But after having turned into an Innocent Monster, his mind was in shambles. Fusing with the grim reaper-like figure of the “Man in Grey” didn’t help either.
If he were to ever see Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it is likely that he would ignore any of his Master’s commands and turn into a murderous, rampaging machine.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Salieri takes the orders from his Master with the obedience of a machine.
Thought it is important to understand that there may be some troubles with communication.
Basically…
If he can recognize something as an order, he will obey it, but there’s the possibility that Salieri may not understand what his Master says. (Not that he cannot understand anything, but rather that his understanding of certain specific things seems to be hindered.)

### Dialogue Examples

“Who, am I? Who am I…!?”
“I am death. I have come to kill the one who is loved by god.”
“Gottlieb Mozart. I will…Kill you…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Antonio Salieri.
Antonio Salieri was a composer in Vienna in the same period as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It appears that there was a time when Mozart firmly believed that Salieri was sabotaging his career (based on correspondence between Mozart and his father). However, there is no independent document from that time that mentions a direct conflict between the two.
In the last years of Mozart’s life, the death of their mutual patron, Joseph II (Marie Antoinette’s brother) served as a common topic for them to bemoan, and they shifted away from being “competitors” and gradually formed a friendship.

Leopold II, wishing to rid the court of Joseph II’s influence, removed Salieri from his position as conductor of the ensemble for the court theater. Salieri was relegated to the low standing position of conducting religious music in the court chapel (he was not required to compose music), and from that time on he often conducted pieces by Mozart. It is said that Salieri himself often chose Mozart’s music for his performances at official events.
In 1791, when the opera “The Magic Flute” was performed at the Theater auf der Wiener, Mozart invited Salieri and personally escorted him by carriage to and from the theater. After the performance, Salieri praised “The Magic Flute” and Mozart wrote to his wife Constanze in Baden about it. That letter to Constanze is the last surviving letter directly written by Amadeus Mozart.

On December 5, seven weeks after this performance, Mozart passed away.

Friedrich Lohoritz, who published a book covering various episodes in Mozart’s life, had a conversation with Salieri about Mozart, and after Salieri’s death, he transcribed the conversation.
“What about the Requiem?”
“Well, I can only say it’s indescribable. It cannot be conveyed in words. It is the manifestation of Mozart’s eternal soul, infused with the holy spirit, as he faced the reality of his impending death after a life of great indulgence.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Antonio Salieri was a friend of Mozart.

He really shouldn’t have been recorded into the throne as an anti-hero to begin with.
Even though Salieri had once lost his position as court musician, he was still a very respected musician who also took many other musicians and their children as pupils. This included Mozart’s best pupil, Süssmayr, as well as Mozart’s son Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart and even Beethoven.

However, sometime around 1820, the rumor that Salieri had killed Mozart started to spread all over the world. Even though it was untrue, people kept imagining this story where “the genius loved by god was murdered by a jealous and hateful prodigy”.
The now old Salieri told his pupil Moscheles ‘that is nothing but vile slander’, but people even took that as a confession of the crime. Later there were even rumors that a regretful Salieri had taken his own life by cutting his throat with a knife.

And now, after long time passed, Salieri’s existence has become warped by the unjustified rumors. His existence has also become fused with the mysterious man in grey, who is also related to Amadeus’ last days, and has materialized as a Servant in this way.
An anti-hero that kills people.
A pitiful man. A furious man. The man who must kill he who was loved by god.
A single innocent monster.

<>

Due to his origin, Salieri is a violent and aggressive Servant, and must be treated with care.
Usually, communication with him would also prove difficult, as Salieri’s humanity also turned into ash, but that wasn’t entirely the case within the lostbelt.
This is due to the lostbelt being a world separated from panhuman history…A world that didn’t scorch Salieri into his avenger form…It would seem that this allowed some of his humanity to remain.
