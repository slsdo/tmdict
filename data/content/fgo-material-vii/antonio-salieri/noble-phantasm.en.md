Salieri condenses and solidifies an enormous amount of murderous intent uncontrollable by any living being, and by combining this with his mana, turns it into a song of destruction that eats away at the body and mind.
A supreme technique and musical noble phantasm that Salieri could never have possessed during his life, and is only possible due to his summoning as the Innocent Monster Servant, Avenger Salieri.

…Yet it is truly a shame.
The “music” that plays is grandiose enough to rival Amadeus’, but the Salieri turned Avenger will never be able to recognize it as “sound”.
