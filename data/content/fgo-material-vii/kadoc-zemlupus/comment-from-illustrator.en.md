When I received the info about Kadoc, I got impressed with how well this character understands how high he is in the hierarchy. My feeling is that since he knows so well what doesn’t work with him, he chooses to wear only clothes and piercings that do look good on him… When he’s standing next to Anastasia, it feels like he doesn’t deserve to be there but that’s still the place that feels right for him to be… The perfect fit, don’t you agree? Doesn’t it sound a lot less bad when I put it that way? (Araya Hachino)
