Hitokiri Izō, unorthodox sword. A Noble Phantasm that was able to reproduce sword techniques he saw once as his own sword techniques.
At the time of summoning he even has the sword techniques he memorized in his past life, but it’s possible to seek a further strengthening after the summoning by seeing new sword techniques.
However, there are limits to the sword techniques that can be reproduced, things that are anything other than Anti-Unit, and things that depend on the characteristics of a Noble Phantasm can’t be reproduced.
