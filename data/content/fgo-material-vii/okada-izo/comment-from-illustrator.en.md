While the thing I was the most conscious about while designing the FGO version was following the image of Izō-san in the original work Koha-Ace, each Ascension stage respectively had great changes. Initially, I thought of an outfit with a military cap and an inverness cape for the 1st stage, but it was FGO-nized while being advised by Keikenchi-sensei, and he turned into an assassin that wears a scarf to conceal his face. (But I really like the original design, so it’d be nice if there was someday a chance for it to come out) Thereafter, feel free! It’s what they said, so the 2nd stage is the hitokiri mode that shook Kyōto, the 3rd stage has the image of Izō-san in his golden age (like when he escorted Katsu-sensei). Also, while I was looking at reference data about Izō-san, I felt a side of him that wasn’t just a thug like for example his feeling of admiration towards Niten-sama (Miyamoto Musashi). Incorporating these elements into each stage, it turned into the final design. (lack)
