### Sigurd

I received an order at the time to be appointed “a character who is a rustic military man with short hair and glasses”, so I came to “Where did giving him glasses come from…!?”. So I designed him with an image of a modernistic protective suit for military use in contrast with Brynhildr’s divine-looking armor, and the motif of a school uniform was chosen to match Brynhildr with her sailor uniform. Just like with his ascensions, it’s not exposing much skin except with the difference of the face. The scar is by being stabbed by Brynhildr in the heart, and the heart is still burning up with blue flames even now. In other words, he’s even the same as Napoleon as he’s been the 「Nice Guy of the Extinguishable Flames」. Even then he’s healed the numerous scars he received in battle initiated by Brynhildr with a recovery rune, and thus most of his body is unscathed except the heart’s scar. Servants appear as they were in their golden days during his lifetime, but I think that the moment he received her lance is in fact his ‘peak’. A man who received his lover’s love is invincible. The thorny bits were an absolute pain to draw so I cursed the designer. What an idiot. (Miwa Shirou)

### Brynhildr

I was receiving a set of orders for Sigurd and Brynhildr to have their costumes and motifs be a sailor suit and school uniform as a common image, so I designed a set for Sigurd’s modernistic and straightforward line of soldier equipment and for Brynhildr’s mystical equipment to be attached with a feathery impression of a Valkyrie. The dark blue colored armor that’s piles up each ascension is whitening, showing a Valkyrie was gaining powers back in her time like hypothesis evolution. There’s a condition that only applies to the original handle section (silver in her second ascension and a gold portion in her third ascension) for her spear and a hypothesis that she acquires a purple heart-shaped enormous blade (?) when she gets passionate for Sigurd. Since she wields it like a halberd, I was thinking, wouldn’t that be a bit too heavy… Her internal imbalance is revealed through the asymmetrical appearance of her left and right bangs and the wing tiara. I asked and they could repair the model and motion with the opportunity being Gotterdammerung’s release. That being the case, I irresponsibly made them do a new design of the lance getting bigger when using her Noble Phantasm. (Miwa Shirou)
