### Personality

A formal and extremely straight-laced person. He wears those glasses that shouldn’t have existed naturally long ago. He’s a man of logic fundamentally; he achieved in getting his father’s revenge not out of love, but because he had an inexplicable sense of duty. He’s blunt towards everyone without a trace of being「affectionate」on the outside. But if he protected someone without any regard towards his own safety, then that is a sign that he trusted that 「somebody」.

He’s a hero, but consequently, he was a strong man honing himself as a mere military man. He has a strict attitude, but he doesn’t expect the same seriousness from others; he is generally “Fumu. There’s that as well, huh.”, which him being generously understanding.

While he does not hold back against formidable opponents, he shows restraint against the weak while being fully prepared to have that decision come back to haunt him in the future. He has no problems if his opponents resort to cowardly methods, but he cannot use it by any means. This sort of principle needs to be supported by strength or else it’s just laughable, but for Sigurd, but it’s no joke when his hidden strength and mystery ranks among the top even among many Servants.

### Attitude towards Master

While remaining disinterested, his earnestness and steady outlook reveals his strength to Masters facing a Holy Grail War. While he trusts Gudrun{{n1}}, he doesn’t have any memories of dedicated love for her; Brynhildr alone is worthy of both his love and affection in the entire world as far as he is concerned when he is first summoned.

On the off chance that he is summoned by an ill-natured Master in a Holy Grail War, he sets certain limits upon himself. The likes of consuming souls or murder of innocents is rejected absolutely, demanding the use of Command Seals from the Master. In that case, he is fully prepared to be ordered to end himself.

A hero that’s「not obsessed with a second life」similarly with Cu Chulainn and others. The one thing he seeks from the Grail is a ‘reunion’ that could probably never be granted, unless Brynhildr is summoned as well -- or rather, should she ever be summoned, it would be nigh impossible to restrain him even with Command Seals. However, he’ll assist even if it means throwing his own life away if the Master approaches him with earnestness and goodwill.

### Dialogue Examples

「Servant, Saber. My True Name is Sigurd. So you’re my Master. Please, give me your orders. I’ll promise to promptly execute them.」

「Demonic Sword, ready. Let me show you the manifestation of mysteries. This is a dawn of destruction-----------------『Bölverk Gram (Heaven’s Ring of Kalpa of Destruction)』!」

「It could not be helped considering your beauty. However, you cannot obtain her love, O Emperor. For I have already attained it.」

### Historical Image · Character Image

The outstanding hero of the「Volsung Saga」is also praised as the「King of Warriors」. The tragic ending has become widely known in the world as 「Nibelungenlied」{{n2}} with several episodes modified.

Especially the famous anecdotes, which are Fafnir’s extermination and the unfortunate love story with Brynhildr. The gruesome battle unfolded with the wicked dragon Fafnir wielding his father’s broken sword that forged the demonic sword Gram. Or when he fell in love with Brynhildr, but married another person after losing his memories. Betrayed and in despair, Brynhildr murdered Sigurd and she even severed her own life in grief afterwards.

Yet, it’s uncertain whether he is the very same person as Siegfried. Sure enough, it’s unclear which one defeated the wicked dragon common in their myths, but it’s possible that both of them defeated a 「different」dragon.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

While the magnificent warrior Sigmund and his second wife Hjordis gave birth to Sigurd, his father Sigmund was killed in battle when he was still an infant, so his mother and Hjalprek{{n3}} took care of him in the country. And as for his mother’s second marriage, Sigurd was raised by the blacksmith Regin{{n4}}. However, Regin didn’t have any love for him-------------instead, he used Sigurd, destined to be a hero and loved by Odin, in his plot to obtain the wicked dragon Fafnir’s treasure.

Sigurd was well trained as a dragon killer since his birth, reforging Gram out of his father’s broken sword, and exterminated Fafnir for the sake of avenging his father, as well as fulfilling his foretold destiny.

Of course, Sigurd didn’t have any hesitation to kill Fafnir, the wicked dragon. Rather, unsophisticated or even stubborn, he was wondering if Regin his foster father would consider himself as family after he achieves the only thing Regin has ever wished for him to do. He cannot reject the possibility of such a desire, even if he was never aware of it himself.

However, the brutal truth was revealed when he had slain Fafnir and drank the dragon’s blood. Regin was planning to grab the gold, so he ambushed Sigurd. It was a hopeless reality that Sigurd faced stoically.

-------Is that so. Nobody ever really loved me.

-------But, in the end, why? That I am even existing right now------

Not having his mother’s love, not even having his father’s love and not even having God’s love. He killed Regin{{n5}}, and departed on a wandering journey, and he came across Brynhildr.

He received a prophecy in regards to his future by his uncle Girpir, a prophet. As he had already known that he’d meet Brynhildr, he decided to never fall in love with her, no matter how beautiful she might be.

However, here, his alertness was overwhelmed by prophecy. A cold young man knew love for the first time in his life as he became indulged in love with this battle maiden, as if he forgot the tragedy awaiting thereafter.

…Eventually, he met a humiliating end, being killed with his own sword as a result of a plot from a woman who loved him. But, Sigurd felt love. It’s said that she was passionately mad with love, but he remembers vaguely her flames of love that didn’t allow betrayal.

The blow of his death wasn’t out of hatred; therefore, it’s love. He knew about that so he laughed in satisfaction. This man, who has laughed fewer times than he could count on both hands, laughed heartily

### Connections with Characters

#### Brynhildr

It goes without saying. This one will absolutely use all his power to love her. As for her murderous impulse, that won’t be an issue there.

#### Siegfried

Our existence is divided from the same legend. While I am concerned in the differences between us, I am instantly relieved to hear that Brynhildr treats him as a different person. Probably since even occidental swordplay differs between styles, I would like to work with him on swordsmanship.

#### Cu Chulainn (Caster)

You’re Cu Chulainn-dono, right? ………Hmm……………?

#### Valkyries (Ortlinde・Hildr・Thrud)

They are like sisters-in-law for this one. With that said, it might be tricky since they have no way to feel any emotions. What should I do, maybe I will seek out someone who has younger sisters.

#### Jeanne D’Arc (Summer Version)

It seems that I was mistaken in choosing which person to talk to.
