### Primeval Rune (Warrior): B

He has Runes, a Norse Magic Crest. As he was taught by Brynhildr, he has the ability to possibly be summoned forth as a Caster.

### Dragonkind Modification: EX

It is the ultimate self-modification due to him swallowing a dragon’s heart. He manifests a mana reactor core as a dragonkind, allowing Sigurd to act nearly independently despite him being a Servant.

### Crystallized Wisdom: A

A magical item that shouldn’t originally exist within mythology. It crystallizes his wisdom as a hero. If another person other than him utilizes it, then the tremendous amount of information will give the person a severe headache.
