A rare Noble Phantasm that takes shape as a demonic sword while possessing the sun’s properties. It is an unparalleled sword bestowed by his ancestor Odin that brings fate, ruin, envy and glory, and at the same time, it determines the rightful King.

Bölverk Gram

Releasing the full potential of Gram, which is originally an Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm. Instead of Sigurd releasing energy from the sword, he’ll draw out the power of the sword by throwing it as an 「Anti-Fortress」Noble Phantasm. “I think that throwing it is more effective” is what he says. The sword that he threw strike a direct hit on the target while spewing flames, followed up by Sigurd slamming his fists with all his power into Gram, having the stabbed edge penetrate deeper even more. Bölverk means 「those who inflict calamity」, which is Odin’s alias, his ancestor.
