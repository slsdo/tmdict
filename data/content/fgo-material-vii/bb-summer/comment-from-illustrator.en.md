Daytime BB, night BB and Nyarly BB all differ somewhat, but she has the image of a bad girl. I wanted to attach plenty of the stars floating on the night sky to the headdress she has in her second ascension♡ Since the stars were arranged with a sparkly☆feel, I kept insisting for her to be a 5 star which I found tons of fun.
