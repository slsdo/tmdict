### Personality

The kouhai-type devil heroine who gallantly appeared on the Far Side of the Moon.
She manipulates her Senpai (Master) as a cheerful and precocious kouhai.
Although she claims to be a great devil and not a small one since originally she was a nice girl, she has a sweet side to her so she isn’t fully devoted to her devil act…however, Summer BB is a bit different.

While first ascension BB is the usual BB,

Upon becoming tan BB (that has Pele installed) in her second ascension, her devilishness skyrockets.
Having installed the divinity of the goddess Pele who is “violent, selfish and usually kills those who get involved with her” in Hawaii, she has become a “super sadistic goddess who keeps driving her beloved into a corner until they die”.
A BB who is going full throttle with the villainous acts, so to speak.
Similar to Dark Sakura who appears in the original work, “Fate/stay night”. (Although, since this is BB, she is not that glum. While delivering condescending lines, she’ll relentlessly bully her prey.)

Furthermore, in her third ascension, she emulates an evil god, and, like the Foreigners, her outward appearance transforms to that of an evil god. In addition to that devil-like form, her nature becomes inhuman too…is what was expected, but when it comes to her fundamental policy, it is the usual BB. (Her degree of seriousness as a Boss rose)
If, speechless, the Master were to go “H-how come?”, she’d reply with “No matter what, even if I am possessed by an evil god, I wouldn’t change! This desire to tease seething inside my chest and this craving to turn humanity into my toys, they are like the sense of security one feels at home!”

### Attitude towards Master

In the regular BB’s case “She will serve faithfully without breaking her wicked kouhai character. There won’t be any personal feelings of love. BB loves ‘good mankind itself’ after all.”, but in Summer BB’s case “As a wicked kouhai character, she has no intention of serving as a Servant. After all, what she likes is the kouhai character trope. (She defines herself as a “kouhai”, but she calls the protagonist ‘Senpai’ less than regular BB) The reason she is by the protagonist’s side is because she took a liking to her new toy. (She can not help but want to break them)”
BB dislikes everything “other than a senpai” so she dislikes humanity too, but in her case ‘dislike’ and ‘love’ are compatible so it’s not a contradiction. That part of her is a pain in the ass.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’ll lead you by the nose♡”

“Are you still carefreely thinking about such common sense (thing)?
There is no need for such a tedious procedure. Why, you ask…From now on, those who come to this island will not be denied, but those who leave will be never let go…
This place turning into such a free island of heaven and hell is the reason, Se・n・pa・i ♡”

“Here, any form of entertainment is exactly as you hoped it would be. Picturesque sceneries, despair, hedonism, joy, stupor, and nightmares; just as you like them.
Everyone, welcome to the Luluhawa Singularity. I welcome you as the ruler of this island.”

“You are pitiful insects who will be defeated by me here and return to the first day.
This time, let’s reset your memories of the loop as well.
There is no future for humanity anyway. In that case, if I were to stop this Summer for eternity, everyone would be happy, no?”

“Nonetheless, a promise is a promise. The Luluhawa Singularity will vanish with this.
The Hawaiian Islands should return to their former beautiful form.
Good work, Chaldea’s Master-san. I have nothing else in store. The adventure of 2018’s Summer ends here. It makes me happy if you have enjoyed it.”

### Setting (Official)

The unidentifiable cyber devil who appeared before us once again to turn the Summer of 2018 into something wonderful.
To rescue Chaldea from various peculiar precedents, she shipped a large number of mysterious slot machines and provided troublesome Alter Egos.
Surely omnipotent, lovely, and a kouhai.
Her identity is that of an ordinary, earnestly cute “sweet evil” who changed into a swimsuit to enjoy Hawaii to its fullest; she’s none other than your BB-chan!
(Evil is not a misprint. The regular BB is a devil while this one is evil.)

To enjoy Hawaii to its fullest, she remodeled herself into a High Servant and entered the extremely fierce “swimsuit market” (red ocean). Ranging from an innocent swimsuit to a provocative one, she’s showing off the power of a heroine who can change into a wide variety of clothes.

“The goddess of everlasting summer, scorching heat and romantic starry skies has been born here♡
I’ll give you an unforgettable resort as a present so keep me company properly, cute Master-san☆”

### Setting (Truth)

Appeared at 2018’s Summer Event.
The organizer of the great Summer event “Summer Servant Festival” held in Hawaii.
This time, she took the goddess of Hawaii, Pele and incorporated the state of being of an evil god from outer space into herself.
It was a setting where she should have become a Foreigner-class, but, going “That has nothing to do with BB-chan~!”, she easily canceled the Foreigner’s control and made her appearance as a SSR Moon Cancer.

Her plan to turn the Hawaiian Islands into an event sire for the Master of Chaldea stemmed from good intentions without a doubt.
Negotiating with Pele who fell into a slumber due to her fading Mystery, she copied Pele’s divinity to turn Hawaii into a festival site for the Servants. (At this point in time, she was damaged from the overload, but since it was the same as usual to BB, she did not view it as a problem.)
However. Afterwards, she carelessly added her ability to Chaldea’s latest telescope located at Mauna Kea Observatories and started stargazing, when her line of sight met with that of ‘something peeking at this universe’.
That thing accessed BB’s perception and started a cognition exchange with her.
As a result, BB became a Foreigner and even her outward appearance became that of an evil god like the other Foreigners.
In addition to that devil-like form, her nature becomes inhuman too…is what was expected, but it remained the same as the usual BB’s.
More like, other than her appearance and the abilities she gained, BB did not change much.
After finding a kindred spirit in BB, the evil god figured there was nothing he needed to do as long as she was around, left BB with the words “I leave bullying the humanity there to you”{{n1}} and disappeared.
As a result, she planned a festival to save the Master from the “despair that awaits them in the future” by locking up the Hawaiian Islands in a ‘cage of time’ with the power of the evil god, and materializing a never-ending resort.
How that ended does not need to be said.
In conclusion, no matter where she is, BB-chan will be BB-chan. Chanchan.

Still, did she really synchronize with an evil god, I wonder?
Maybe it was all just BB getting the wrong impression, a sort of placebo effect.

“Something watching this place from deep space.
The evil god that could be called a trickster that doesn’t exist on Earth, that does not originally belong to this universe, one who entices and toys with all kinds of sentient lifeform and drives them to self-destruction.”
Setting aside what kind of being that is and whether it exists, BB observed its gaze as something real and incorporated it into her self-developing program.
Evil God Emulation…the skill trees she originally accumulated as a ‘universal last boss type kouhai’ have been invested into the ‘evil god last boss type kouhai’ from 1 to 999. As a result, her nature became different from that of the regular BB (the scale of humanity’s health care has gone even more out of control), and even her function is different (time manipulation system).

### General Armaments

Unlike the other swimsuit characters, she does not use Summer-feely weapons.
In the first two ascensions, she mainly uses a “fake cute hand-to-hand fighting style” and her showy moves include things like dunking with a ball of magma and summoning a volcano geyser with a snap of her fingers.
In her third ascension, with her devil wings spread out, she mainly engages in aerial battles, and by freely transforming her tentacles, she becomes a cruel fighter who thoroughly mangles her opponent with swords, sickles, claws, and tentacles.
“Oh no\~, BB-chan is so cruel\~!”, acting like a cute child in such a manner, she tears her opponent into pieces. What a little devil.

### Connections with Characters

#### Mysterious Heroine XX

I don’t want to think about the Servant Universe, but when it comes to its theme alone, then it’s a different matter! Mm\~\~, I want to try wearing a spacesuit too\~!
 
#### Foreigners

It’s a space trope on the serious side. With a foot already in this category, I’m in no position to deny that. Yes. When humanity’s in a pinch, you use what you can!
 
#### Lambdalyrris

A pseudonym, so there was a move like that too! As expected of Mel-, no, the Mysterious Alter Ego Lambda. To be capable of such light footwork while remaining classy, BB-chan will follow your example!
But, are you fine with this? The mermaid motif is proof that at your roots, Melt-chan and that woman you hate the most are exactly the same, you know?
