Cursed・Cutting・Crater.
The hole of curses boring into the world, utilized by BB who has synchronized with the Moon Cell in “Fate/Extra CCC”.
A space of insanity that transforms surroundings into the space of imaginary numbers by enlarging its own shadow, lowers the rank of the world and the lifeforms existing in it to that of low-dimensional beings and are then toyed with by it as if it was a ruler.
The Noble Phantasm of the regular BB was surgery in a “cute, fun and cruel nurse outfit” that cause the enemy to degrade, however, this is a serious operation where BB’s ability is utilized in its full glory.
The attack of a last boss who, as the progenitor of horror-type heroines, uses “large-scale, terrifying and seriously awful” as her motto.
BB, who’s turned into a giant entity from a higher dimension, gouges out the land without breaking a sweat. Like how one would scoop out pudding with a spoon.
