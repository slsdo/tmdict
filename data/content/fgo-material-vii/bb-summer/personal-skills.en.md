### Self Modification: EX

A skill possessed by the regular BB. The skill to remodel oneself.
The AI created by the Moon Cell has been provided with the absolute command to “never upgrade their functionality”. However, BB who escaped from this restraint as a result of a bug has begun to expand her own abilities.
To enhance her computational ability, NPCs, AIs, and even Servants were preyed upon and disassembled with her Black Noise, and utilized as her own memory. Although it was a retrofit where it wouldn’t be surprising even if she broke down, in the end, BB transformed into a superior AI with a huge capacity.
At first glance, she seems like an ordinary perfect beautiful girl (her own words), but inside her, an absurd amount of functional devices and facilities have been compressed.
In “Fate/Extra CCC”, as even A-class Wizards such as Tohsaka Rin and Rani VIII have called her a “monster of giga structure”, in the cyber world, she possesses the same volume of information as a single world.
Originally, in the material world that special characteristic wouldn’t be counted…no, it wouldn’t manifest, but because she possesses the trait of “eroding reality” due to the Evil God Emulation when being observed by “those who can see”, her original information processing ability…her original form compressed into the space of imaginary numbers…can be caught a glimpse of.
This is the reason why only Swimsuit BB has the “super giant trait” and regular BB doesn’t.
 
### Grail of The Golden Pig: A

Aurea Porc Porcua.
They say that even though the goddess Pele abused the hog demi-god, Kamapua’a, she deeply loved him. This has an outstanding affinity with BB who gives her loved one the piglet treatment.
The Hawaiian version of the golden grail that BB pilfered.
The difference between it and the usual one is that this is something to be used on oneself. By swallowing this, BB-chan’s S switch was turned on.
A superior skill that lives up to the Holy Grail name with its NP charge, HP recovery, invincible and Noble Phantasm damage increase. What the heck, this is awesome. However, its recharge time is immense as well.
 
### Faceless Moon: EX

The lingering scent of the god who drives humans into their ruin in order to test them. Also called the Third Eye.
A Reality Marble that turns the boundary aspect of the space of imaginary numbers more definite, casting the surroundings into the “Far Side of the Moon (Shadow Phase)”. When the world is covered in the Moon’s shadow, time in its entirety is frozen.
It is not only the authority to stop time for 3 turns where the same cards will be dealt, but also grants one the luck (critical stars) to fight selfishly, as one pleases.
