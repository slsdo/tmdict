### Item Construction: -

She possesses an A-ranked Item Construction skill, but because of Skill Tree: Evil God Emulation, the skill itself has been frozen.
 
### Territory Creation: A

This skill does not seem to be blocked/frozen, but its orientation is different from that of the usual BB.
A repulsive Territory Creation skill that erodes into reality, cuts it out, and preserves it for eternity as a “different world”.
 
### Magic Resistance: -

She possesses a B-ranked Magic Resistance skill, but because of Skill Tree: Evil God Emulation, the skill itself has been frozen.
 
### Existence Outside the Domain: B

Observers from outer space and the abyss.
One of these beings’ and BB’s “eyes just happened to meet” and from such a form of contact this pseudo skill was born.
 
### Divine Core of the Goddess: A

The transferred divinity of Hawaii’s goddess of volcanoes, Pele.
Although limited to the Hawaiian Islands, Pele is a powerful goddess so the skill’s rank is high.
 
### The One Who Devours The Land: EX

Pele’s epithet. As a personification of volcanoes and magma, Pele was a goddess who ruled over flames and the earth.
Referred to as Pele-ai-honua (one who devours the land). Being a skill that grants a permanent burn immunity, it’s simple and handy.
