### If I Change Into My Swimsuit: A+

Her ability to enchant the masses or specific people.
At A+ its power is tremendous.
(Usually this would be a composite skill that includes Golden Rule (body), but in FGO its effect is a bit different)

### Eau De Toilette - White Honey: B

Medb’s voice and breath are endowed with a honey-like sweetness, which allows her to influence the target’s stats just by existing.
In the case of animals or humans without protection against magical power, she should be perfectly capable of bending them to her will.
For example, it’d be easy for her to turn a small boy into a brave warrior comparable with a veteran. Conversely, she could also take a hardened warrior and turn them into a child.
She can even freely mess with a Servant’s stats if they don’t have the means to resist.
A skill similar but different to “Alcoholic Fruit”.
When using this skill, she applies perfume to herself, so if one were to interrupt her, the skill could maybe be interrupted…But one must wonder how many people are out there who can actually stop Medb.

### Discipline of the Queen (Sea): A

Medb’s charisma as a queen has now reached the level of violence.
