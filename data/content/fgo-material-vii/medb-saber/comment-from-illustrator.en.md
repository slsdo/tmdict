I was instructed to make Caladbolg into a weapon that could change and turn into a whip, then I also got some really extreme Medb-like suggestions from Takeuchi, and well after I kept stacking things on her the design was obviously rejected (lmao). As for Medb’s swimsuit, her first one’s the only one suited for swimming comfortably, her second stage is for beachside photoshoots, and her third stage is for indoor studios. Her cute little penguin friend becomes about as big as a polar bear on her final ascencion, and he’s super soft to the touch too! (Takayama Kisai)
