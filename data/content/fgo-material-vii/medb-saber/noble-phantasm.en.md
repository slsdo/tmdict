Fergus My Good-Looking Brave.
Fergus was one of Medb’s lovers during her life, and now she’s taken his demonic sword Caladbolg to use as a weapon.
It is possible to use it by casting its true name, but Medb’s holding back this time. Even Medb, or rather, precisely because this is Medb, there is no way that she would ruin a beautiful resort by causing an earthquake.
Nobody knows if her having this Noble Phantasm is due to her legend of being able to make any hero hers, or if she simply borrowed it from the Fergus in Chaldea.
Its power obviously decreases compared to when Fergus uses it, but its flexibility and versatility have been upgraded in exchange.
Whenever Medb cutely swings the sword, small rainbows become visible.

One-shot My Love.
A one-time summer romance. A one-time commemorative photo (one-shot).
The normal Medb possesses the special attribute of having the Noble Phantasm of every hero who fell for her, but having changed her saint graph with a swimsuit, she also gained a new Noble Phantasm.
In other words, this is a fearsome anti-unit sure-kill Noble Phantasm that utilizes one of Medb’s greatest weapons, her “beauty”.
Medb will be walking while humming, and by simply giving her target a “Well, hello there”, they will inevitably fall for her and be trapped in a summer love. It is inevitable.
The target will then have no choice but to fall exhausted into the summer sky after being toyed with by her.

Whoever gets targeted by this Noble Phantasm should feel proud of themselves.
After all, only the few chosen good-looking braves, or rather, good-looking slaves are the ones who get approached by Medb.

This is a Noble Phantasm that works by using her charm, but surprisingly it doesn’t apply a continuous charm effect.
“Well, that’s what summer romances are like, right?”, is what Medb herself says.
