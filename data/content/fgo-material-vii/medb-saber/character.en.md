### Personality

She’s the same as always.
Pure and clean. The seductive and vicious Queen Medb.
The beautiful flower that blooms at the center of the universe.
Or rather, the grand flower with seeks to engulf the whole world with her blooming beauty.
In addition, she’s now something similar to a gravure idol. She’s aware of her nature as someone who draws other people in.
Since Medb is well aware of the power and value of her own body, it was only a matter of time before she settled into modern times and became a glamorous Servant.

### Attitude towards Master

Same as always.
She will not give them special treatment. She simply treats them as any another fan or photographer worshipping her.
There are rumors that she’ll allow you to conduct a private photo session if you get her to say something like “looks like you’re quite the good-looking brave yourself”, so please do your best.

### Character Image

Exactly the same as when she is a Rider.

### Others

It seems she’s gotten really into making her own albums.

### Connections with Characters

#### Cu Chulainn

I’m already loved and worshipped by so many people, so I don’t want you, ok?

(Or so she wants to say, but can’t. She really loves Cu. If he still won’t look at her, then there’s no choice but to resort to brainwashing. Or so she had decided, but when she finally meets Cu she just wishes he’d tell her something like “that saint graph’s not bad”.)

### Fergus

T-h-a-n-k-s❤
Let me borrow your wonderful sword for a bit, ok?
I could change my own Saint Graph if I wanted, but hey, a Saber’s gotta have a sword, right?
Yeah! Now I’m a Saber too!
I’ll go beat up Cu!

### Scathach

I finally got a swimsuit!
Now I can have a summer battle on even footing with that woman.
…Or so I thought but she didn’t say anything and just gave me a grin. What’s her deal!?

### Scathach-Skadi

She has her same face, so how is she so different…
And how come she interests me so much?
Hmmm…
Well for now, let’s just go to the beach together!

### Tomoe Gozen

I can’t help but be concerned about her status as widow.
It doesn’t seem like she’s simply being faithful, but, that girl is like…
…I guess I have no choice but to confirm it myself.

### Any male Servant she likes

I think that would feel different when I’m a Saber, compared to when I was a Rider.
So now I have to confirm ❤.

### Fionn mac Cumhaill

I hate men who won’t obey me.
He won’t stop talking proudly about his wife either, what’s with him!?
