### Personality

Mature, pessimistic… but.
For good or for bad, he has a scholarly and too serious personality, good resignation, intense prejudices, and at times, he sometimes does preposterous things.

### Attitude towards Master

Fundamentally treats them with a reverent attitude.
But, in the case that the Master is compatible as a core, he’s willing to betray them.
Whereas they think it’s painful for him, he keeps acting with cool-headed thinking.

### Dialogue Examples

「Combat is my weak point.
But a mage properly prepares the means to make up for that.」

「Be born from the earth (mother), drink the wind (knowledge), be filled with water (life);
if you swing the fire (weapon), disease (the devil) shall go away.
Righteousness shall guide your blood to purity.
Thy name that embraces Ru’ach{{n1}}, is Adam!」

「A long journey and cruel decisions await you.
But I believe.
——— Fight, young boy/girl. I trust.
That only humans have the strength{{n2}} to endure this responsibility!」

### Historical Image · Character Image (Investigation: Miwa Kiyomune)

His official name is Solomon ben Judah ibn Gabirol.
There isn’t any relation in particular with the ancient king Solomon.{{n3}}
He was a philosopher and poet from the 11th century, and a Kabbalist that dealt with one genre of magecraft, the Kabbalah.
His achievements include introducing ideas from ancient Greece that were preserved in the Arabian culture sphere into the European culture sphere.
His philosophy itself wasn’t accepted in Europe, but it is told that the foundations of the Renaissance were built inspired by a rebuttal to those teachings.

It was commented that because of his weak constitution he was pessimistic and 「seemed like an 80 year-old elder despite being 16 years old」.{{n4}}
As a poet, elegies were said to be his forte.

### About Golems (Investigation: Miwa Kiyomune)

Golems are considered robots manufactured by some magecraft, but they’re originally a mystery of Kabbalah ——— Judaism, meaning “fetus” “one who is not formed”, truly the esoteric art with which the Lord created Adam from a lump of earth.

By breathing your breath (Ru’ach) into the golems produced from a lump of earth, they obtain life, and move.
The golems in this state don’t have any knowledge, and become existences that move according to their creator’s will.
But, since they have no knowledge they sometimes move distorting the orders of their creator, and to manage them correctly, the correct orders must be inputted.
It could be said that appearance is similar to the relationship between humans and machines from recent times, computers.

In order to defeat or dispose of a golem, the general method is to erase the “e” from the word emeth (more accurately, in Hebrew), meaning “truth”, carved on its forehead (top of the head) (or written in an affixed parchment), and changing it to “meth”, which means “death”; but being strict this is not a weakness.

The miracle of a golem is recreating the miracle of the Lord by blowing life into a vessel of earth, and although an imitation, in order to destroy that, a power surpassing that miracle is required.
For that reason, the word “emeth” isn’t a weakness, but the golem’s emergency stop device… It would be better to call it a method established as safety.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

There is no change about him being a misanthrope even after having been summoned as a Servant,
but he’s making an effort to communicate a little positively, as if there were various things to think about.
However, he isn’t very fond of being called teacher.

He is ignorant about the subtleties of the emotions of others, but he is never dull.
But if the reasons lie beyond logic, he’s likely to be confused.
In short, his state has mostly become『knowing that you’re angry, but not knowing why you’re angry』

#### Sieg

Should I say I’m glad I didn’t make you the core?
Should I say my blunder resulted in you being here?
In any case, you’re here now ———— God bless you.

#### Siegfried / Chiron / Vlad III / Astolfo / Frankenstein

I’m really sorry.

#### Mecha Eli-chan · Mecha Eli-chan II

Wonderful!!

#### Antonio Salieri

…… You, with your face being so refined
is there any meaning in wearing a mask?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} In Kabbalah, the middle soul, the spirit. It contains moral virtues and the ability to distinguish good from evil.
2. {{note2}} Written 強靭さ instead of 強さ. 強靭 can also mean “tenacious”.
3. {{note3}} This clarification isn’t just because he’s called Solomon too. Apparently, a 12th century philosopher mistranslated his signature as “Solomon, the Jew, the king”, and attributed many of his works to THE Solomon.
4. {{note4}} Avicebron was said to have lupus vulgaris, skin lesions produced by tuberculosis. He actually had a complex about this, and described himself as “short and ugly” in some poems.
