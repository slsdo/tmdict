Golem Keter Malkuth.{{n1}}
Caster’s incomplete Noble Phantasm whose creation wasn’t fulfilled when he was alive.
An autonomous-type Reality Marble that imitates『the primeval human (Adam)』, and continues repainting the World for as long as it exists.
Even if the creator Caster perishes, it will continue moving without it mattering.
It can obtain the blessing of the earth, and it will never perish as long as its feet are on the earth.
Its weapon is an obsidian sword. In addition, unification with the being that will become the core as its motive power is necessary.
If it’s a mage or someone with excellent Magical Circuits, this golem itself will increase its strength.

However, Servants are fundamentally omitted.
Because, for the sake of the objective that is the completion of paradise this Noble Phantasm must stay in the world for a long time, but in the case of Servants, the incorporated Magical Circuits disappear at the same time of their annihilation.
Nourishment as a mere clump of mana is quite problematic, though.

……Outside its original purpose, even if it’s temporary, in case an extremely high fighting power is required, it’s able to endure being used against Servants.
But Avicebron, who acknowledges that 『temporary usage』 as blasphemous rarely makes use of it.
And say nothing about fighting by using himself as the core ————

Really, it’s something absolutely unconceivable.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Keter Malkuth (The Royal Crown) is the title of one of Avicebron’s works. It’s a text that measures the spehres of the Universe and makes the reader feel small but at the same time praises them with a proclamation of divine grace. At the same time, Keter and Malkuth are the highest and lowest sephirot of the Tree of Life.
