She was a character with exposed limbs from the beginning, however, I realised I didn’t think about the setting of her tattoos even though her arms would be even more exposed in a swimsuit than before. In the end, I made it so the tattoos on the shoulders and arms were not connected. Later, in her third ascension, her abdomen was exposed too and I left that without tattoos. With that said, when I was drawing the tattoos, I had every intention to draw them correctly, but each time they were ever slightly off which was quite the conundrum… (Hidari)
