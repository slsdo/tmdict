### Personality

She seems like the usual Ibaraki Douji.
She hasn’t changed that much in character either.
If you look at it from another angle, it’s to the extent of whether “she’s become more cheery” or not, though pointing that out to her will definitely get you bitten. However, when Shuten-douji went “You’re awfully cheerful and restless and, well, you look lovely behaving like a child. Did you like the sea that much?” as she observed this strange occurrence, Ibaraki didn’t snap at her.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Same as usual.
Her wish for the Holy Grail is “to see Shuten’s smiling face” so not a single thing has changed.

### Character Image

“Summer is here.”
“When talking about Summer, it’s the Summer festival.”
“When talking about festivals, they are brilliant, full of enjoyment and there are night stalls with lots of delicious things.”
“I see, such events are not bad at all.”

“…Before I noticed, due to the Summer get-up, my class has changed.”
“Various things changed about my Noble Phantasm too. Probably.”

“I’m not too sure about the reason, but anyway, let’s savour this Saint Graph as much as we can, shall we!”
And so, Ibaraki Douji is enjoying the days of Summer to their fullest.
Specifically, she will eat loads of delicious things for a start.

### Connections with Characters

#### Shuten-Douji

Look, Shuten~!
I’ve turned into such a form!
I’m so pumped and excited.

#### Dharmapala Girl (Shuten-Douji [Caster])

Wawa, wawawah, it’s Oni Cure!
Oni Cure~!

#### Ushiwakamaru (Swimsuit)

Now then, Ushiwaka, where and what should we play next?
No, it’s not like I care, it’s just that if you want to play that bad, I don’t mind keeping you company. Yeah.

#### Minamoto Raikou (Swimsuit)

Awawawa…

#### Watanabe Tsuna

How is it!
How is iit!
Know that I am not of a caliber that can be confined to a single Saint Graph. Tremble in fear. Kukuku…KAHAHAHAHA!

#### Robin Hood / Sakata Kintoki

I won’t accept your charity, fools!
However, if it is a tribute offered in fear then I am not reluctant to take it.

#### Goddess Pele

Is she the one who toyed with my Saint Graph and turned me into a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit, you ask?
No, the one who forcefully tampered with my Noble Phantasm was unmistakably Shuten, though it seems like the one who gave me these clothes was that Pele or who…
Hmm, I don’t remember it that well. Well, whatever. More importantly, me and Ushiwaka have to eat shrimp now. …Shrimp, huh.
