### Demon of the Oni Race (Water): B

A variation of the skill that expresses the supernatural power and demonic nature of the oni.
The nature of her Mana Burst has also changed to “water”.
“Isn’t that already a Kappa?” or so Ibaraki states her suspicions.
“Is it because my Saint Graph changed?”
“No, wait. Now that I mentioned it, a bit before something, I think I recall Shuten-douji tampering with my bones or something and since then my body’s condition felt different…”
“What the heck, if it’s something from Shuten then it can’t be bad!” Such thoughts go through Ibaraki’s head and she cracks a wide grin. Good for her.

### I Won’t Return Yet!: B++

A skill resulting from the Disengage skill going through an unexpected transformation.
“Evening has come, but I want to play more on the beach so I don’t want to return to the inn yet.”
“Even if it’s night time, I want to play.”
“Still, if everyone goes back I have no choice but to do the same. Since playing by myself is no fun…”
The feelings of a downhearted Ibaraki are expressed in this skill.

### Summer Time Trouble Girl: A

Ibaraki who is brimming with a playful spirit can be easily found in the center of a disturbance.
A skill that invites both weal and woe.
─────Now then, will an oni or a snake come out{{n1}}?
