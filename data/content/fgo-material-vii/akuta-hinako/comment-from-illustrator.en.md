A very long time after I had delivered Yu Mei-ren’s design, I got commissioned to design Hinako… and I remember making her exactly how the story required her to be. Looking now, it’s a pretty plain design, but I don’t think it’s a design I could have made if hadn’t drawn Yu Mei-ren before. Because I have this belief that if I’m getting called to be a guest designer I need to stand out to make it worth it… The “The Silent Woof” book she’s seen holding was based on a copy of “The Silent Miaow” I randomly found in my work office… She hasn’t removed the Book Off sticker from the cover. Seeing Hinako’s reveal was deeply emotional moment for me because it had already been two years since I first designed Yu Mei-ren. (toi8)
