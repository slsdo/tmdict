Des Océans d’Allégresse (The Oceans of Glee). By offering her prayers to the oceans, Jeanne can summon Phantasmal Beasts. Perhaps she has a connection to those Phantasmal Beasts, but she can call forth most of those related to the sea and use their powers. The highlight is the blue whale. Which gives the impression that one would die if it came crashing down on them, or something like that. Furthermore, Jeanne sincerely gives each and every one of these animals a name.
