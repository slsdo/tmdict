### Personality

At this occasion, Jeanne herself thinks that although she changed into a swimsuit, there is nothing particularly different about her. But of course, she is absurdly different. With a carefreeness in valuing the summer over the innate goodness of men and being light and airy from beginning to end, there is the feeling that she is clearly running at full throttle to make the summer festive. Furthermore, her notion of wearing a swimsuit for the purpose of simply enjoying the summer rather than for dressing herself up is quite strong.

However, when her Saint Graph enters its Final Stage, Jeanne undergoes a Class Change from “the older sister of the dolphins at the beach” to “a Saint who swooped down upon the everlasting summer.” Changing the Lord’s divine protection into a hoop (halo) of light, she transforms into a high-mobility shooting Saint who does as she pleases.

Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: “What are you? Really, what the hell are you!?”

### Attitude towards Master

Originally, Jeanne was going to break down her guardian-like gimmick when she was going to change into a swimsuit, but the girl, who is a Ruler, decieded to choose righteous discipline as her motto and view all relationships as platonic from beginning to end.

However, Jeanne’s reason as a Ruler was annihilated once she got into the Archer Class. She openly changed into a sad monster who was convinced that she is an older sister. Surely at first, she had recognized to some degree that “It’s nice to think of myself as an older sister”, but at the time when she became a Swimsuit Blademaster, perhaps because her spirits have become the highest they have ever been, she can even fire brainwashing beams.

Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: “No, seriously, what the hell are you? What kind of mental structure do you have!?”

### Dialogue Examples

“O’ Lord, I offer this vacation to You…!”
“Come now, let’s go~! From this Saint, the blessings of the Great Oceans shall be delivered! Hop, Step, Great Oceans! Des Océans d’Allégresse!”
“I’ve come to answer your summons. I’m Jeanne! Given that I’m an Archer at vacation this time, I won’t say any stiff words. Let’s enjoy the summer vacation, ok?!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The magical energy of the summer has finally corrupted even the Saint… wait, corrupted? By having her Class changed from Ruler to Archer, Jeanne’s unprecedented nature that she had originally attained was furthermore strengthened.

Jeanne herself personally thinks that her spirits are only a little bit higher and that nothing much has particularly changed compared to when she was in the Ruler Class.

Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: “No, she has completely changed. Just about everything about her has completely changed. She has become far nastier than when she was in the Ruler Class!”

In addition, because she changed her clothes, Jeanne has also started a manga circle as a new hobby. She formed the circle “st. Orléans” together with Marie Antoinette. For the duo in question, they intend to draw a love comedy manga, but from the way it seems, their work got a reputation in a different sense with things like “No matter how you read it, this is an explosion scene”, “Rather than saying it’s bittersweet, it’s like saturated, sugared water”, and “I don’t understand why you would launch a smartphone from a cannon in order to get a person’s contact address.”

Comment from her (Altered) younger sister: “But I truly don’t understand the reason why in the hell those are selling so well!”

### General Armaments

Dolphins, rings, balls, etc.

### Connections with Characters

#### Jeanne Alter (Swimsuit)

“You’re making manga right? Then I’ll make one too. Let’s do our best together! By the way, you need a German dictionary? Why? Also, where did you get those Japanese swords from?”

#### Marie

When the two are present, the beach will already turn into a sea of gorgeous celebrities. Perhaps since the two also get along naturally well with each other, it is fundamentally common for them to act as a pair.

#### Other Swimsuit Servants

“Gorgeousness is a nice thing, isn’t it?! I don’t know whether if it’s fine for the likes of a plain person like me to join in with you all, but as a representative of the nameless flowers, I’ll do my best!”
“… And to think of such things, even though they’re the most gorgeous. A swimsuit is basically something for me to wear to participate and have fun with the others after all, so to wear a swimsuit just to dress myself up, that’s not something I would think about.”

#### Saber Astolfo

“A cute rabbit? WHY!?”
