Swimsuit Jeanne, she was a character I was a little worried about in regard to her methods of attack. In the beginning, when she was called an Archer, I even thought about a gigantic water gun for her, but in the end, I cannot grow accustomed to a Saint with firearms. At the end of ups and downs, it became “I have no choice now but to put a dolphin here”, which led to her becoming the current Dolphin Saint. For her 1st stage swimsuit, I designed its appearance so that it is arranged in the form of Jeanne’s swimsuit appearance in Fate/EXTRA. (Takeuchi Takashi)
