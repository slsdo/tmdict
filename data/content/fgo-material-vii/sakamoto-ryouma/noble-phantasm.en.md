A human-shaped Independent Noble Phantasm that usually takes the form a black-haired woman named Oryou, but transforms into a dragon upon True Name Release.
Even in her usual human form, she still has enough monstrous strength and combat skill to face Servants evenly, and the Mystics enveloping her body boast a defensive power so off the charts that she can’t even be scratched by regular attacks. When her True Name is released, she takes the truly majestic form an ancient dragon and overwhelmingly wields her power.
Her Rank is EX in the sense of impossible to judge adequately.

The black-haired woman always by Ryouma’s side, Oryou.
She fell in love at first sight when he saved her from staying sealed in a mountain and used repaying the favor as an excuse to act as his wife. She’s technically not a dragon, but rather a lesser draconic being, closer to mononokes like Mizuchi or Orochi.
It’s possible that a lot of his exploits during the Bakumatsu had her help behind the curtains. Or maybe not.
By the way, unluckily enough, Ryouma’s last moments happened while she was away, which means she couldn’t help him.
Consumed by sadness, she disappeared into the depths of the oceans, beyond human reach, turned into a dragon and never soared the skies again.
