### Personality

Sakamoto Ryouma, the Hero of the Restoration. An aloof man on his mid-20s. He may be a master of the Hokushin Ittouryuu, but he’s actually a kindhearted guy who dislikes conflict to his very core.
In a Holy Grail War set in Japan, he would be a powerful Servant with a unique type of Riding Noble Phantasm and fame levels that rival Oda Nobunaga.
In order to hide his True Name, he speaks in standard textbook Japanese, but he lets some Tosa regional expression slip every now and then.

He left his name in history without trying to, just by doing everything he could for the kind people around him.

The problem with his personality is that he’s easy to like and easy to misunderstand. Since he acts so aloof, no one can tell what his intentions are, furthering the problem.
For that reason, he lived a life with many allies and many enemies.

His partner Oryou-san is not the one from historical fact, but rather an ungodly something that was sealed, pierced stuck to one mountain.
Ryouma, at the heights of his youthful impetuosity, pulls off the sealing spear and releases her.

### Likes

Mackerel sashimi, wild chicken stew (but wild chicken stew gives bad luck, so he avoids eating it). Foreign ships, travelling, new things.

### Dislikes

People with prejudice against those of different birth or education. Suicidal thoughts.

### Attitude towards Master

He wishes to have a good friendship with his Master no matter who they are, without exceptions.

### Dialogue Examples

Ryouma: “Serpent of the landmass, sequestered to Amasakahoko… I only know of my deeds. Amakakeru Ryuu ga Gotoku!”
Oryou: “Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!”
Ryouma: “Yeah, most of the times, I move when it’s already too late. Well, better late than never, in my opinion.”
Oryou: “Ryoma has some screws loose, so I need to babysit him.”
Oryou: “Hey hey, you gonna chicken out?”
Ryouma: “Stop, don’t provoke them.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Sakamoto Ryouma, a low-ranking samurai from the Tosa domain. One of the shishi who contributed the most to the Meiji Restoration, being the central figure of the Satchou Alliance, founder of the Kaientai, and proposer of the restoration of imperial rule.

As a child, he was considered an underachiever, to the point he was expelled from his cram school supposedly for bad results. But once he started his sword training, his skills increased remarkably fast.
Later on, he travels to Edo to study swordsmanship and joins the Chiba dojo to train the Hokushin Ittouryuu. At the time, Commodore Perry’s fleet of American black ships come to the Uraga seas and seeing that was very meaningful for the later parts of his life.

After returning to Tosa, he joins the Tosa Loyalist Party formed by Takechi Zuizan. However, he later deserts Tosa to live in the Chiba dojo in Edo. There he finally meets Katsu Kaishuu and becomes his disciple. This encounter would lead to great changes in Japan’s history later down the line.

Thanks to Katsu Kaishuu’s intervention, he was absolved from the crime of desertion. Then he did everything he could to advance Katsu Kaishuu’s plans of founding a training grounds for marines. And when that’s done, he works there as a head naval instructor.
The changing trends of the time lead to the start of a suppression movement against the Tosa Loyalist Party, casting a dark shadow over his friends Takechi and Izou. Ryouma even receives orders to return to his land, but he ignores it, branding him a deserter for the second time.

In 1865, after multiple incidents like the Ikedaya Incident and Kinmon Rebellion, he founds the Kameyama Shachuu (later known as the Kaientai), an organazition very similar in personality to modern corporations.
Through deals of arms and ammunition, he achieves the great feat of mediating the long-time enemies Choushuu and Satsuma, forming the Satchou Alliance.

At that time, events like the Teradaya Incident, where Ryouma’s dissenters go after his life, started becoming more frequent, but that didn’t stop him.

He continued his work, which included writing a project for new national structure, titled Eight Proposals While Shipboard. However, 1 month after the emperor returns to power, he is assassinated in Oomiya, Kyoto. Died aged 33.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

I didn’t want to cut anyone,
I didn’t want to shoot anyone.

At first, it was for the kids in his neighborhood, then it was for his friends from his village, then it was for his comrades-in-arms, then it was for the nation of Japan.
He was born with a kindheartedness that made him constantly challenge the eras for the sake of someone else, from beginning to end. Everyone liked him, everyone found him unsettling, and in the end, when he was cruelly murdered, he left the living world with no grudges or regrets about it. From beginning to end, he was dreaming of a society where everyone would have an enjoyable life. That’s all there was to it.
