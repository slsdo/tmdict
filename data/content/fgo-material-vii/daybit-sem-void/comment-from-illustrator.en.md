From the start, I was given a very detailed description of what Daybit should look like, so I got the design done on my second try (on the first try I misunderstood the prompt and sent in a wild man with his huge muscles exposed). He may not look like a character with a lot of facial variety, but he has multiple expressions with very subtle differences, so please do your best to tell them apartâ€¦! (Keitarou Takahashi)
