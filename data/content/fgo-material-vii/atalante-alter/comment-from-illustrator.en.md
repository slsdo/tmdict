“Let’s make the first or last a cute and cool dress!” is what I decided on and this is how it turned out. The ferocity of tearing her chains apart as she dashes out was also incorporated into the design. …In other words, just where was she kept? Having her tail increase in numbers as she grows strong is quite the bargain. And then, it might become a weak point which, when grasped, would make her unable to muster any strength. It is presumed that she got the power of the beast under control in her third stage and clad herself in armor with it. (Konoe Ototsugu)
