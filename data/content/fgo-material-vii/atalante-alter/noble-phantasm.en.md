ταυροπολος έκλειψη.
Atalanta pours all of her mana into the Tauropolos she normally uses and releases a single shot.
Rather than an arrow, it would be more apt to call it an enormous missile.
The devoured opponent is absorbed by a viscous “darkness” and assimilated.
To resist this, an extremely powerful Magic Resistance skill is necessary.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Tauropolos is the name of Atalanta’s bow, the Bow of Heaven, which comes from one of Artemis’ epithets. Said epithet is interpreted to mean “worshipped at Tauris”, “pulled by a yoke of bulls”, or “hunting bull goddess”. There was also a festival of Artemis in Athens known as Tauropolia. Eklipsi (έκλειψη) is Greek for eclipse.
