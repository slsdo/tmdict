### Self Evolution: EX

A skill for improving oneself that surpasses Self Modification.
Continuously evolving in order to overcome anything that would hinder the accomplishment of one’s goals.
However, it has the demerit of having a reduced general applicability compared to Self Modification due to being overly specialized for one’s objective at hand.

### Crossing Arcadia: A

One can jump over any obstacles on the field, including enemies.

### Wild Beast’s Logic: B

A combat-focused thought process resulting from transforming into a beast.
It can’t be used for finding weak points, but the speed of mental processes executed for the sake of swiftly murdering the enemy is accelerated.
By combining this with the Self Evolution skill, the speed at which enemies are defeated increases even further.
