### Personality

Under normal circumstances, she’s looks innocent and distrustful. She talks in a distant and uninterested manner, especially immediately after being summoned.
She’s able to speak with beastly demonic beings that are yet to exist in the world.

She’s generally cold towards the masses, and not only the Russian ones.
“If you’re meant to perish, then there’s nothing I could do about it”, she says as bluntly as possible.

The point is… Anastasia has absolutely no love for Russia whatsoever.
Since was raised in an enclosed, sheltered environment, she doesn’t harbor a single shred of love for the Russian people.
To Anastasia, the Russian are only a symbol of barbarity and slaughter, while also being fear itself.

But, at the same time, she understands she’s a proper heir to the Russian throne, born and raised in Russia with Russian blood in her veins.
Her mentality regarding how to balance her social position with her feelings gets quite complicated, and her mulling over it results in others seeing her as indifferent.

Anastasia is actually a mischievous girl who loves pranks, pranks and more pranks.

### Attitude towards Master

Due to her distrusting disposition, she keeps her fair distance.
Said distance shrinks as her bonds are raised, but she shows some signs of emotional dependence to the ones she’s close to.

### Dialogue Examples

“Have a peaceful death.”

“Listen. I did not save you because you’re special.
I did what any Servant would do, because you trusted me.”

“Hold my hand and don’t let it go… Stay where I can see you.
If can hear me, always answer.
I don’t want to… lose anyone again.”

### Historical Image · Character Image (Anastasia)

Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova is the last Grand Duchess of the Romanovs, the family who ruled over Russia for three hundred years.
She, the fourth child of the moderate Tsar Nikolai II and the Tsarina Alexandra, was raised with all the love she could get.
But despite the Tsar’s moderate politics, the world was on its way for a revolt.
With their loss in the Russo-Japanese War, the shooting of civilians, and other incidents, the Tsar’s glory was in the verge of crashing.

However, the Tsar was raised ignorant of the truth of Russia, learning only of the history passed down through the Tsars, and the Tsarina was living at the top of the world as a noblewoman.

Despite the fact Anastasia was a prankster girl who loved to cause mischief by climbing on trees and whatnot, records says she was often nursing her sick brother Aleksei.

If they were not an imperial family, all indicates they would have enjoyed peaceful ordinary lives, but their era was the central point of a revolution.
And then, without them reading the telling signs of the era they created, Anastasia loses her life by association with her parents.

Nikolai’s family abdicates the Tsar throne and are sent to live in a confined space, until they are gunned to death along with all of their servants. In order to cover up the incident, their corpses were cut up and burned with gasoline, then had sulfuric acid poured in the remaining bones, then finally got buried.

Afterwards, there was a case where a girl claimed to be Anastasia, but she was completely refuted by a DNA test performed on the discovered bones.

Back on topic: while the Russian Revolution was an incident often considered inevitable for its era, had the imperial family not many any wrong choices, they would probably end up being exiled to the Tsarina Alexandra’s homeland of Germany, and the Revolution could probably have ended bloodless.

However, the Tsarina made the worst call possible at the time.
Afterall, it’s said that she not only put her full trust in the shadiest charlatan priest there was, but also went as far as sharing her bed with him.

The name of said priest was Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin.
The Mad Monk Rasputin himself.

### Historical Image · Character Image (Viy)

An iron figure, with iron fingers and heavy eyelids, whose species cannot be counted as fairy nor Elemental.
Viy is a kind of monster or youkai originally created by the famed Russian author Nikolai Gogol in the 19th Century.

The theology student Khoma went to pray at an old-looking church, but he’s attacked by a witch trying to eat him alive and by the monsters she commands. So, in the night of the first day, he draws a circle of exorcism of exorcism{{n1}} and starts to continuously pray inside it.
The monsters get annoyed at the fact they can’t see him, until they utter the words “Call Viy here!”.

And eventually arrives Viy, a short and stout monster with eyelids dripping down to the floor.
The moment he says “Pull my eyelids up for me!”, the monsters work together to open his heavy eyelids.
“I can’t look at him!”, thought Khoma. But he fails to resist and makes eye contact with Viy.

“He’s here!”. The instant he said those words, the effect of the exorcism disappeared and Khoma’s life ends in tragedy.

Also, it’s hinted at the beginning of the story that the Viy is a real legend in Ukraine.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

On the day before their murder, Aleksei confessed to his sister Anastasia a secret passed from Tsar to Tsar.
Every previous Tsar has being followed by something mysterious.
It protects the Tsar, but it may also harm them.
A thing most fickle, incomprehensible and completely invisible to humans.

The fairy or Elemental Viyy formed a contract with the Romanov Dinasty,
and was used as a familiar to keep the Romanov family alive.

But Anastasia was killed before he even got the chance to respond to her contract.
Viy chose to unify himself with Anastasia in order to complement her Saint Graph.

A girl and an Elemental who should have been harmless complement each other in a way that promoted them to the status of Heroic Spirit.

…She appears in the Russian Lostbelt as Kadoc Zemlupus’ Servant.
She toys with the single minded Kadoc while showing both her side as a queen and her side as a girl.

### General Armaments

Viy’s hauntings.

### Connections with Characters

#### Rasputin

Anastasia is extremely cautious around him, since he dealt the final blow to Romanov Dinasty.
On the other hand, she’s also conflicted because she’s grateful for how nice he was to her when they were alive.

#### Ivan the Terrible

He was a great Tsar who existed long before her family… but…
“Excuse me, I have one question… Why are you so elephant?”
“I do not know either. Why am I an elephant?”
More of a symbol of fear than of respect.

#### Osakabehime

“May I borrow your kotatsu? No?”

#### Kadoc Zemlupus

The person who summoned her as a Caster.
Her feelings towards him and his feelings towards her are something probably even the two don’t understand.
Romantic love, yearning, comradery in arms, familial love, partnership, companionship, and the list goes on.
