I already knew some stories about her, so I aimed to make her an unhappy girl who looked not only ominous but also scary. For that reason, in my first drafts I drew her looking a little bit sicklier, with big eyebags. Much later, I got to learn who her Master in the Lostbelt was going to be and gave a little smirk at the fact they almost had matching eyebags (laughs). During the drawing process, my thoughts were focused entirely on the videogame Icoâ€™s world design. (sime)
