### Shvibzik: B

Anastasia’s past nickname (means “little imp”), while also one of Viy’s abilities.
It makes all forms of minor impossibilities possible. It enables small prank-level Marble Phantasms, such as transferring what the opponent is holding to her own hands or opening a crack on the ground and getting the opponent’s foot stuck there.
It’s quite the absurd ability, but it’s unable to cause any lethal damage.

### Glacial Charisma: B

A special Charisma that circulates only among those of Tsar blood.

### Mystic Eyes of Clear Sight: D

Mystic Eyes that descended from Balor, in a different de-evolution line as the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.
Viy’s ability, not Anastasia’s power.
It breaks down any Bounded Field and sometimes can even find weakness in fortresses.
Russian Tsars supposedly fought on sieges under extreme advantage due to receiving this ability from Viy.
