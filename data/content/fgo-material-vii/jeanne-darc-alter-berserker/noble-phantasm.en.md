Völkemord Feuerdrache.
In order to compete with Jeanne Darc, the mountain instead of the sea.
Born of the idea of using fire instead of water.
Summons a black dragon-like thing with her power as the former Dragon Witch, and spreads disaster.
It’s not necessary to say the reason why it’s in German anymore.
Because it’s cool.
