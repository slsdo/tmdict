### Schwartzwald Falke: B
German. It’s translated as falcon of the black forest, but… There’s no meaning… in particular….
Seems it was added 「because it’s somewhat cool」.
Mysterious power.{{n1}}

### Fallen Witch: A+

A transformation of the Dragon Witch skill,
due to the shift from the Avenger class.

### Meurs Où Tu Dois: EX

Accurately, it’s “Va où tu peux, meurs où tu dois”.
Go to the place you must go, die at the place you must die… A French proverb.
For one reason or another, she who is an Avenger is looking for a place to die.
Not a pleasant, gentle death.
No matter how intense, how desperate it is.
Hoping that’s a satisfactory departure,
she continues fighting every day.
