### Personality

She became a Berserker from Avenger, but perhaps because the basis was easy to transform, the difference isn’t rather significant.
If anything, it’s to the point that the serious elements have disappeared.
She changed into a swimsuit and was full of motivation to enjoy Hawaii, but because she obtained a certain dōjinshi, the world changed.

### Attitude towards Master

The usual familiar friend attitude.
She thinks it’s natural to involve him/her, and believes they’ll naturally follow her.

Even if the separation is contracted, even if she will eventually wake from her dream.
These memories are eternally hers.

As long as there’s that fact, she will always proceed to battle.

### Dialogue Examples

「The time has come. It is the beginning of Sabbath!
The crows sing, sing…, the black cat goes meow!」

「O’ three-headed black dragon,
eat away the world!
Völkemord Feuerdrache!」

「Tirelessly re-raising me from scratch.
You, do you like me that much?
Huum, well I’m a Servant
so I can’t answer to your feelings, though.
At least I’ll allow you to be at my side.
… What’s with those eyes?」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A central character in the summer event 「Servant Summer Festival!」.
She started up the circle 『Gespenst Ketzer』and continued drawing manga together with the protagonist.
Everything was because of her rivalry to Jeanne Darc, but it seems that there was at its basis there was something that couldn’t be attained without hatred and longing for『the development that was inconceivable』,『the story that should have been fulfilled』.

It is said that, after the summer event ended, even if she was amazed at herself and asked「Why was I so frantic?」, her sense of distance with liberal arts Servants is closer than before.

Also, as an aside, she won’t overlook that the reason why she was in such high spirits was because of Luluhawa’s air.
She was so looking forward to this trip that she read the airplane’s guidebook taking notes with post-its.

Although she spent her days busy with manga, having been able to fully enjoy Luluhawa by making a loop became a memory she won’t forget in her whole life.

### General Armaments

Japanese blade ｘ3
* Arahabaki{{n1}} 72 Flashes (Arahabaki Nana Jū Ni Sen)
* Great Black Poison Dragon All-Destruction (Black Mamba)
* Mumei

She left the third one without a name on purpose.
「In English, it’s Nameless…」

### Connections with Characters

#### Jeanne Darc (Swimsuit)

Hah, how pathetic I am for being move by such a book.
I will cut that karma apart, and exceed it…!
(※It’s the manga you drew)

#### Other swimsuit characters

Everyone’s as festive as they please…
What do they think Luluhawa is…?
(※You’re the one who’s being festive)

#### Osakabehime

I learned very well the know-how of dōjins.
Maybe it’s because we didn’t have any connection in life, but I often go visit her room and read a book.

#### King of the Cavern

I feel like this man’s high-spirited speech has recently become a habit.
If I get careless, the characters’ speech will turn similar.

#### Shakespeare

Are you doing this story, this genre, this material too?!
Weren’t you interested in, like, preserving materials for humans of later generations?!

#### Sieg

He transforms into Fafnir, that means he’s in essence my subordinate?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} A god after which clay dolls known as [Shakōkidogū](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Dogu_Miyagi_1000_BCE_400_BCE.jpg/220px-Dogu_Miyagi_1000_BCE_400_BCE.jpg) were said to be modeled. You’ll probably know about them if you’ve played SMT: P4. They have ties to the Ainu, so it’s extremely hard to find much information unless you’re an expert moon reader.
