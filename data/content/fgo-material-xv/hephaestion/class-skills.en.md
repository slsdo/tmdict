### Independent Action: B (EX)

A skill enabling sustained independence from a Master’s magical energy supply. At rank B, it permits two days of continued existence without one.

In reality, the true rank of this skill is EX. Merging with Mnemosyne has effectively granted her a unique magical energy reactor.

### Camouflage: B

A skill enabling the concealment of one’s true status and class. At rank B, the user can manipulate others’ perception to believe they belong to a different class or possess altered status values.

### Territory Creation: EX

A skill inherited from Mnemosyne. As an Autonomic Observational Existence Verification System, she is inherently a self-contained workshop. Due to her integration with Mnemosyne, she can fully replicate workshop capabilities within herself.

### Oblivion Negation: EX

A skill inherited from Mnemosyne, seemingly akin to Oblivion Correction, yet fundamentally different. As a system named after the Greek goddess of memory, she retains nearly perfect recall of past summonings when summoned through Chaldea’s process.
