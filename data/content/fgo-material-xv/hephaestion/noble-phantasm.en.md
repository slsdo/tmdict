“My name is Hephaestion! The foremost retainer of Iskandar, the greatest Conqueror King to have ever existed! Charge, Hecatic Wheel!”

“My name is a lie. My body is a shadow. But these falsehoods are my pride. Once more, I hold these reins in my hands! Shatter them! Hecatic Wheel!”

She once possessed Iskandar’s Noble Phantasm, the Gordius Wheel, during her lifetime. However, instead of the usual Divine Beast, it’s said she summoned skeletal dragons to pull the chariot. Though lower in rank to the original Gordius Wheel and its devastating charge, Via Expugnatio, this version offers precise magical control and autonomous operation. Moreover, its rank can be temporarily elevated by channelling magical energy into it.

In FGO, the Hecatic Wheel, optimised for short-term combat, is often used by Faker in a strategy that involves simultaneously overcharging it with magical energy and enabling autonomous operation, allowing it to attack enemies alongside her.
