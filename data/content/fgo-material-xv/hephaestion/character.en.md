### Personality

A ferocious warrior, raised as a mage from the Age of Gods. Tempered by countless wars, she has honed her nature, body, and magecraft for combat. To fight well, eat well, drink well, and die well—that is all she desires. If she can do so for her one and only king, then all the better.

A devout follower of Dionysus, the god of wine, she has an insatiable thirst for alcohol. Convinced that modern times offer superior quality and variety, she relishes invitations to drink from other Servants or Chaldea staff. However, she should never carelessly agree to a drinking contest. Among Iskandar’s army, none could match her drinking prowess. Even spiritual wine that could intoxicate a Servant can be drained by her in one gulp.

### Attitude towards Master

While she acknowledges no king but Iskandar, this is merely a matter of priority. She will demonstrate proper understanding and loyalty to her summoning Master. However, this is contingent upon her recognition of her Master’s effective use of her abilities. If she is dissatisfied with her Master’s orders, she will not hesitate to reject them.

However, it is highly unlikely that she would harm the Master of Chaldea. She harbours memories and promises she will never forget, though the Master of Chaldea may not recall them.

### Dialogue Examples

“A warrior is forged in the body, the will, and the soul.”

“Wine is great. Intoxication is the proof of life. Don’t make that face. I’ll share with you someday.”

“I won’t let them off the hook. Even if their betrayal was at the behest of my king.”

### Character Image in History

Hephaestion, Iskandar’s closest confidant, was so intimate with him that Iskandar declared, "He is Iskandar too." Iskandar often likened himself to Achilles and Hephaestion to Patroclus, Achilles’ best friend, even in his final moments.

From Pella, the capital of Macedonia, and of the same age as the Great King, Hephaestion was said to have grown up with him since childhood. They were inseparable, whether at the Mieza school where Aristotle taught or during numerous battles, including the Eastern expedition. (Although his name does not appear on the official list of Mieza’s students, Aristotle’s letters mention him, suggesting a high likelihood of his education there.)

As a subordinate, Hephaestion was renowned for his organisational skills, particularly in supply, logistics, and diplomacy. His first recorded achievement was as a diplomat. Notably, his handwriting so closely resembled Alexander the Great’s that when Hephaestion fell ill in Egypt, Alexander wrote diplomatic letters on his behalf. In military matters, Iskandar often entrusted Hephaestion with the command of another unit when the army needed to be divided.

Among Iskandar’s many subordinates, Hephaestion was his greatest confidant and the strongest supporter of the Great King’s dream of uniting Europe and Asia. He was one of the first Macedonians to engage with the Persians and willingly took a foreign wife at the mass wedding in Susa.

A testament to Hephaestion’s profound understanding of Iskandar is an incident that unfolded when Iskandar visited the site believed to be the ruins of Troy. As Iskandar paid his respects to Achilles at his tomb, Hephaestion mirrored his gesture at Patroclus’ tomb. To mourn and honour these heroes and their friendship, they stripped naked and engaged in a footrace. This extraordinary act underscores the depth of their bond.

The death of Hephaestion, Iskandar’s most loyal confidant, was a devastating loss. Overwhelmed by grief, the king ordered the execution of the Ecbatana physician who had failed to save Hephaestion and smashed the floor tiles of the temple of Asclepius. Iskandar lay motionless on his bed for three days, weeping and refusing to eat.

He also commanded that the manes and tails of all horses in the army and neighbouring cities be cut, that all music be banned, and that the parapets of walls and fortresses be demolished. Mourning himself, he cut his hair and extinguished the sacred lamps in temples throughout the empire, as if a king had died, causing people across the empire, from India to Greece, to mourn.

Hephaestion was cremated in Ecbatana or Babylon, and a grand funeral was held. The funeral was held in Babylon, where athletic competitions with three thousand competitors and a literary contest were held to honour his soul.

Eumenes, Iskandar’s secretary, was so moved by Iskandar’s grief that he suggested asking the Temple of Amun whether Hephaestion should be deified and even offered to cover the expenses. Although Hephaestion was not ultimately deified, the Temple of Amun declared that "Hephaestion possesses the qualifications of a hero recognized by the gods" and granted him a place in the hero’s temple.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Hephaestion, renowned as Iskandar’s closest confidant. She is not him… but rather, his twin sister. Raised by Iskandar’s mother, Olympias, to be his magical double, she was given no name and adopted the identities of Iskandar or her brother as needed.

Surprisingly, she found pride in her anonymity. When Iskandar offered to give her a name, she vehemently refused. For her, anonymity was a means of shielding Iskandar by absorbing curses directed at him, and was the very purpose of her existence. Iskandar’s figure shone so brightly in her eyes. Just as every king and soldier of the time was captivated by him, she adored him above all others.

Therefore, she despised the Diadochi and the subsequent Wars of the Diadochi. Though she died before they broke out, when summoned by the Ionioi Hetairoi, she automatically learned about the wars through the Grail or the world’s knowledge, and inevitably rejected the summoning. For while she deeply revered her king, she could not bear to fight alongside those who had betrayed and dishonoured him.

…This is her backstory as presented in ‘The Case Files of Lord El Melloi II.’

In FGO, the summoned version of her assimilated a fragment of the Mnemosyne Autonomic Observational Existence Verification System. Consequently, her True Name registered in Chaldea is Hephaestion Mnemosyne. While referred to as a True Name, it’s essentially a practical identifier rather than a personal name. Due to this, exclusively when summoned within the Chaldea system, she retains memories of past summonings, resulting in subtle shifts in her thoughts and perspective.

Primarily, the memories of her past summon—the experiences with the ’man without a heart’ during their expedition into Pan Human History’s Spiritual Tomb of Albion—resonate deeply within her now. As such, she requests to be addressed as ‘Faker’, the name of an Extra Class distinct from her current self. She cherished that name because it was bestowed upon her unconditionally, without any attempt to alter her identity. A sentiment she held dear, considering she had no desire for a name.
