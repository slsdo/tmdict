### Riding: EX

Though Martha never mounted the Tarasque in her younger days, her Saint Graph is based on the “Martha who subdued Tarasque barehanded,” much like her Rider version. Thus, she possesses equally exceptional riding skills.

### Territory Creation: B

She can set up her kitchen anywhere, ready to cook up a storm anytime.

### Item Crafting: D

Her skill is confined to crafting kitchenware, but she can produce utensils that were unknown to her in her previous life.
