### Personality

Marta’s essence in her younger years was that of a young maiden-villager, proficient in household chores and always greeting the world with a beaming smile. The might she would later wield to overcome the dragon Tarasque with her bare hands has now faded.

Holding the belief that violence is never the answer, she has a very strong stance about wrongdoers who resort to it for any reason.

What she holds dearest in this world is kindness above all else.

### Attitude towards Master

She cares for her Master like a younger sibling, ever worried that they’re not eating enough and making sure to offer them plenty of food.

### Dialogue Examples

No worries, big sis has got it covered!

Let’s have lots of fun this Christmas, Master!

Master, are you getting enough to eat?

Freshly baked bread is on ♪ Its ♪ Way ♪

Ready up, Tarasque!

### Character Image in “FateGO”

With a freshly minted Christmas Saint Graph from Scáthach-Skadi, she steps into the role of Santa for the 2021 Christmas event.

Her memories (records) in this state are somewhat unclear. While she acknowledges her Master and understands she is a Heroic Spirit, she doesn’t fully grasp that she is Saint Martha. It seems similar to the case of Alexander the Great, but when questioned, she responds, “Me, a Saint? Really? I trust you’re being honest, but this is hard to believe,” and acts as though she has nothing to do with it.

Her understanding of what exactly a Santa Claus was, was sort of vague… but after consulting previous Santas, she came to realize that Santa’s duty is to guarantee a successful Christmas feast. So, in order to deliver the ultimate Christmas dinner, she has to cook the best meals.

### General Armaments

Laddle Wand.
Regarding the design, it seems she received oversight from Magical Ruby and Dharmapalady (Shuten Douji Caster) until she got their approval.
