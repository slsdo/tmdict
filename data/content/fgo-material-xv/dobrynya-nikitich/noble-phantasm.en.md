### Zmey Gorynych: The Wicked Dragon Comes and Breathes Out Sin

Nikitich’s 1st Noble Phantasm. She temporarily summons Gorynych, the legendary three-headed dragon, and they burn the target(s) with a flame breath x3.

Furthermore, Dobrynya Nikitich herself, who is not satisfied with only that, approaches the target(s) just as she sees an “opening”, brandishes a mass of Damask Steel, and swoops down on them. Even if one withstood the triple-headed Dragon Breath, it seems that being hit very hard by a superheavy weapon as the finishing blow would make sure they would not come out of this safely, no matter what kind of tough person they are.

Bereza Damask (Birch Damask). Nikitich’s 2nd Noble Phantasm. A set of a Damask Steel mace and a Damask Steel breastplate. The mace is a precious weapon of his that was given to him by his mother, while the breastplate is one of the equipment made for Dragon Slaying that was given to him by the “Monarch of the Sun” – Vladimir the Grand Prince of Kyiv.

Moreover, on the occasion of Nikitich materializing, it appears that the breastplate has changed into the form of circular ornaments, but from the way it seems, she can turn them back into its armour form during a situation where defensive strength is particularly needed. As a Noble Phantasm, it is sturdy. Extremely sturdy. And heavy. Heavy to the extent that an ordinary person cannot lift it up.

Bereza Burko (Birch Burko). Nikitich’s 3rd Noble Phantasm. Swift horses that dash across the vast land with brave warriors on them often appear in the Epic Poems of Heroes. One can say with confidence that it should originally be a genuine horse… but maybe because it received the wicked dragon’s curse, its outward appearance has changed into that of a flying dragon’s (and yet it can still talk like before), and even its very existence has also become closer to that of a Dragon Kin’s.

Moreover, when Nikitich is using her Noble Phantasm “The Wicked Dragon Comes and Breathes Out Sin”, from the way it seems, this horse (flying dragon) is being treated as a vessel of sorts for the wicked dragon.

Nikitich’s beloved horse (dragon) frequently talks. (The power of perennial youth that originated from her beloved horse is now deemed as something that was turned into a special characteristic of Nikitich, and has been separated from the horse for “The Eternally Young Warrior” Skill.)
