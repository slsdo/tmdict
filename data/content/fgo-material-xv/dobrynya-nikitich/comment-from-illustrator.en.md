My image of Nikitich is of someone vigorously beating up her enemies with light armaments and blunt weapons. The design of her 2nd Stage’s looks was settled first. After that, I came to also want to draw a gallant figure like that of a young warrior’s, and thus the design of her 1st Stage’s looks was born. (I was greatly fastidious about the ears of her cap moving whenever her facial expression changes.) I designed her to ride while standing up so that this form of mounting a flying dragon as a Dragon Rider is also giving out a sense of weight and speed behind it. I believe that she turned out to be a very reliable figure. (Robi~na)
