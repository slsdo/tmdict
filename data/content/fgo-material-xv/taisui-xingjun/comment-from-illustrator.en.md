I designed them in the order of boy, then young man, then Kon. When I look back at the early Kons, they were a bit too short and stubby because I was so focused on trying to make them look like mushrooms. After drawing them many times, I think it is now in a more comfortable balance. I drew a lot of elaborate Kon meat dishes because of the “infinitely multiply and edible” setting, but Takeuchi’s reaction was that it was a bit too gruesome so they were shelved. The Kons moving in the game were so adorable, so I’m glad that they weren’t cooked. (take)
