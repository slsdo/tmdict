Earth Moved Atop Taisui’s Head.
A Noble Phantasm that brings disaster to those who awakened him. Even today, “moving the earth on top of Taisui’s head” is an idiom used to mean “acting without knowing one’s place”, which just goes to show how deeply his curses are feared. There are still written records of Taisui dating back to ancient times. In one example, the “Hiro Yiji,” a man named Li digs up Taisui and inadvertently brings about the death of his entire extended family—over seventy people.
