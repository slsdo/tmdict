### Magic Resistance: A

Nullifies all magecraft below rank A. No modern mage can harm him with magecraft.

### Item Creation: C

Can create magical tools. Surprisingly skillful with his hands. It is unknown whether Kon is as skillful as he is.

Taisui Xingjun is clearly a Taoist God, however as a Chaldean Servant, Taisui has the strong quality of being “an incarnation of the lump of flesh Taisui”, a nature connected to him via a singularity, as a result there is a slight negative adjustment.
