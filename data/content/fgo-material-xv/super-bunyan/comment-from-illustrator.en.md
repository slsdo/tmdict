Considering Super Bunyan’s personality I dressed her in casual everyday clothes. As she is a leader who is helped by her friends, i aimed for a bright and easy-to-move-in design, with a certain Pokemon trainer in mind. The third ascension is based on President Bunyan, who appeared in “Learning With Manga~” (Riyo)
