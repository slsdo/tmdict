### Personality

Similar to Zhuge Liang and Ganesha, she falls into the category of Pseudo-Servants where the original host’s personality is the most pronounced, so she’s essentially the same Bazett as in Hollow Ataraxia.
…However, from a certain point in her ascension (specifically, at the third stage), she makes way to the Goddess of Hospitality.

(Third Ascension Personality)
The complete opposite of Bazett’s straight-laced persona, she is characterised by a soft-hearted personality, always wearing a tender smile. The type of thoughtful giver who hardly refuses anyone, earning her popularity with children who know she’s never without a sweet treat. Though she may sometimes ask for something in return, her gestures are genuinely motivated by selflessness. Guided by her prophetic insight gift, Manannán always prioritizes actions that ensure the best outcomes in the long run. As a result, her selfless or seemingly unprompted kindness can be challenging for some to grasp.

As the Hospitality Goddess, she receives all who come to her with graciousness, listens to their entreaties with care, and offers aid with a compassionate smile. Should they request that she punch something for them, she carries out the task promptly, all the while keeping a warm look. If two people ask her to punch each other, she will, of course, comply with a smile as well.

Myths recount that Manannán was a shapeshifter with a soft spot for beautiful women, siring many offspring and engaging in numerous romantic affairs. This made Fergus particularly fond of him, regarding that as the epitome of the true Celtic lifestyle. Given that, he frequently voices support for a player lifestyle, proclaiming that everyone should indulge as they please, with his help always available.

“Howerver, force connections is imperdonable. Pursuing marital spouses and any manifestetations of disloyalty is absolutely forbbiden…!”

In these rare moments, you might notice him displaying genuine anger. Polygamy is allowed, but he has zero tolerance for adultery.

Though Bazett views Cú Chulainn with a childlike reverence, Manannán considers him a grandson, part of his own family, to whom he has gifted various Noble Phantasms. According to Bazett’s own theory, Manannán shuns public showing up in Chaldea due to the tales in which his wife, Fand, fell for Cú Chulainn and walked out on their marriage.

(About Manannán’s hospitality)
Now it’s time to share a little secret with you.
That twirly dress is expression of the Archmage and Sea God Manannán’s influence on her personality, right? Wrong, that’s a lie. It’s not that Manannán mac Lir manifests through Bazett’s womanly side. Rather, it’s the other way around. What’s really happening is that she leverages the idea of Manannán’s influence within her to cater her feminine urges.

So, is that feminine flair simply a expression of her own suppressed wishes, you ask? Probably, but that’s something herself is likely unaware of and would probably never admit.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Uninterested in the Holy Grail, she’s simply fulfilling her duty to protect the Human Order.

### Dialogue Examples

It’s a bit disconcerting to regard myself as a Servant… Thankfully, it appears that my responsibilities remain unchanged. Update me on which targets must be neutralized.

Manannán mac Lir’s power is certainly remarkable. Yet, it’s somewhat disheartening to see that I fall short from his might. I must practice further…

While I understand that the Master’s responsibility is to take care of their Servant, it’s a bit strange for me since this is my first experience being taken care of. I wonder if it’s okay to feel as blessed as I do…. (fidgety)

What’s that look for? If you have something to say, go ahead and say it… Lancer!

#### Second Acension

Greetings. Your presence is greatly appreciated. Would you care for a sweet?

Well, if it isn’t little Cú Chulainn. Is there anything you desire? Anything at all… except, of course, for my wife. Hahaha! My apologies for the twisted humor!

Greetings, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. How are you liking that one spear? While we are at it, permit me to offer you some guidance. Please refrain from stealing other people’s lovers. That never brings any good.

### Historical Image · Character Image

Manannán is an archmage renowned as the Celtic God of the Seas and Lord of the Underworld, as well the foster father of the Sun God Lugh, father of Cú Chulainn. Legend has it that he once had a faerie wife named Fand, who fell in love with Cú Chulainn and abandoned him to pursue an affair. After her attempt to reunite their marriage following her relationship with Cú Chulainn, he pardoned her but used a magical cloak to prevent the hero from ever laying claim to her again.

Skilled in many mystic arts, particularly shapeshifting, Manannán used his talents to court many mortal women and fathered many children.

He was also famed for his vast collection of magical artifacts. The list goes from Fragarach, to a mystical boat, a pig that returns to life after eaten, an apple branch that induces slumber, and a white steed that traverses both the land and sea, among others. He is frequently depicted in the myths as the one who endows his legendary artifacts to great heroes. To Lugh, he granted Fragarach and his magical boat; to Cú Chulainn, he bestowed his helm; to Diarmuid, he bequeathed his spear.

And this time…

### Character Image in “FateGO”

At his core, he is a being who holds a great love for humanity and uses the his loved sea as a means to bestow his blessings upon them. For this very reason, he couldn’t remain passive in the face of this crisis in human history and manifested through Bazett’s body, a human with whom he had perfect compatibility. Since what resides within this vessel is merely a portion of himself, carrying a silver of his original power, he has been classified as an Alterego. This act mirrors his past deeds of granting magical artifacts to brave warriors, except now he has chosen to give a part of himself as help. While he was somewhat taken aback to find his vessel to be a goofy and sourpuss woman, there is not much to be done right now. He just uses his godly powers to strengthens her fists and provide complete backing for her one-strike fighting approach.

### General Armaments

Fists (rune-enchanted footwear and gloves).

### Connections with Characters

#### Cú Chulainn

A former Servant of hers, kinda weird. He seems both all tangled up and somewhat proud of her at the same.

#### (For Manannán)

He is both the son of Lugh and a member of his own family to whom he has gifted many divine artifacts… At the same time, he’s also the hero who earned his wife’s heart, so they relationship is quite complicated.

#### Pitch-Black Avenger

A former Servant of hers. Though they haven’t encountered each other in Chaldea, he’s likely to burst into laughter if he knew about her.

#### Diarmuid

One of her childhood heroes.

#### Fionn mac Cumhaill

One of her childhood heroes.

#### Kirei Kotomine

That priest is a good person. Trust me, I’m a great judge of character!

#### Casters who would likely be sealing designation targets

I’ve got a hankering…

#### Queen Medb

What’s a hotshot like Manannán even doing here? Anyway, seems like she and my dear Cú share some history. That really pisses me off… I need to keep tabs on her!
