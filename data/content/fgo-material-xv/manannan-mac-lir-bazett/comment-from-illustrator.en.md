The first ascension is a sleek modern knight’s suit, the second is a magical battlesuit, and the third is a stunning pearl full-skirted gown. The second one was probably the trickiest of the three. But I think I ended up with a pretty solid result, in trying to make it stand out from other Celtic designs while keeping it stylish, thanks to all of Mr. Takeuchi’s corrections. (Hayashi Kewi)
