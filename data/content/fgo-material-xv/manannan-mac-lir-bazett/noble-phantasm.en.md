Gouging Sword of the War God.
Also known as “Freagarthach,” this dagger was gifted by Manannán mac Lir to the Sun God Lugh. It is also famously referred to as “The Retaliator” and “The Answerer”. This Mystic Code excels in counteraction and harbors the deadly ability to “preemptively deliver a fatal blow” by reversing the causality of the opponent’s ultimate move. It’s the Noble Phantasm that has been handed down through the generations of the Fraga family, the God’s Holders…. However, since Bazett is now the vessel for its original wielder, she’s able to deploy Fragarach in much more fundamental capacities.

Stampede Sword of the War God.
While the enforcer Bazett usually needs a month of preparation to her Fragarach’s ceremony, its original wielder, Manannán, is capable of generating it with far greater ease and by various means. The essence of this Noble Phantasm is rooted in Manannán’s qualities as a maritime deity and Énbarr, his white mount that gallops across the seas. In this application, he takes the form of his white steed, said to be the embodiment of the sea’s waves and spume, and reshapes it into The Retaliator. Simply put, this is a neptunian foam-Fragarach.
