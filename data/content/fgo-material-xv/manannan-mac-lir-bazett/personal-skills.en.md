### Sealing Designation Enforcer: A

The anti-mage tactics written into Bazett Fraga MacRemitz’s bones. A synthesis of martial arts, magecraft, and self-discipline engineered to allow her to carry out sealing directives issued by the Association against dangerous mages.

### Sea God’s Runes: EX

Bazett’s rune magecraft, now channeled through the power of the Sea God, Manannán. Although the Manannán currently residing in this Saint Graph is but an Aspect, he nonetheless possesses divine attributes. With his magical powers hinting from this source, one might anticipate a broad range of magical applications. Yet, due to Bazett’s somewhat fumble-fingered nature, his abilities are confined to “strengthening the spells she regularly employs.”

### Red Branch Successor: B

Comprising a league of distinguished warriors, the Knights of the Red Branch was once regarded as the greatest knightly order in all of Ireland. Though Bazett is obviously not a knight but a mage with Celtic roots, there was once a time when a great hero referred to her as a “modern-day Red Branch Knight”… or something to that effect.
