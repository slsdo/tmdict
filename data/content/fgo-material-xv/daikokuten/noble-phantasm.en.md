An underground mice-themed amusement park is brought into existence through the manifestation of a Reality Marble. Individually weak and insignificant, the rats compensate by outnumbering their foes through rodent-like tactics, such as setting traps, creating diversions, and launching blind onslaughts. It is undoubtedly a traumatic experience for anyone who goes through it. As this Noble Phantasm also embodies the prolific nature of mice, it allows for the breeding (alter-ego splitting) of units.

A magical furnace packing substantial reserves of magical energy, capable of explosively discharging this power to instantly allow the casting of a Reality Marble.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Also the title of a children’s story. In the tale, an old man goes to the mountains to cut down trees and shares his meal with a passing rat, who promises to return the favor. The rat takes him to a underground hole where they live, revealing a magical kingdom of happy rats. The only rule in this kingdom is not to say the forbidden word “meow.” The old man enjoys himself greatly and returns home with a trove of coins and treasures for his wife. Overhearing the story, a neighboring woman makes riceballs for her husband, hoping he can replicate the trick. He’s invited to the kingdom but utters the forbidden word, causing panic among the rats and the paradise to collapse, leaving him in the dark. He then starts digging for remaining riches and eventually becomes a mole, never to see the light of day again.
