### Personality

They’re caring, attentive, sophisticated, gentle, and workaholic to a fault. Their life’s calling is to serve others. Although each clone created by the Noble Phantasm possesses its own consciousness, they share a collective memory. Despite this, each clone exhibits a distinct personality of its own. No. 1 is wise and collected, while No. 2 is youthful and bubbly.

### Attitude towards Master

As the Master of their lord, Daikokuten, the Master commands the highest level of respect. No matter the extent of their service, it will never truly be enough.

### Dialogue Examples

Good to day to you. We are standing in for Caster Daikokuten at this time. Please accept our apologies, but our Lord is exceedingly busy and cannot accommodate your invitation right now… Therefore, we have been assigned to cover his duties in his absence. Please feel free to call on us for anything you may need.

What happens if a cat starts meowing here… Better switch off the lights already… We’re closing up! The way out is over there, everbody… Careful where you step…

### Historical Image · Character Image

Originally a wrathful war god in Indian tradition, Mahakala was introduced to Japan, where his aspects of abundance and wealth were emphasized. He was later syncretized with the local deity Okuninushi, becoming one of the Seven Lucky Gods still celebrated in Japan to this day.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Although this is an Daikokuten’s summoning, it manifests as two white mice who act as his representatives. Daikokuten’s elements are virtually absent with the spiritual core operating at a drastically lower level. Yet, his wisdom can be downloaded when required.

Though they manage to subdue their primal instincts through their devotion to Daikokuten, this aspect occasionally resurfaces in their need to proliferate their kind. Daikokuten’s mice do breed and expand their population, but since no one has observed this process, it’s unknown whether it follows the same patterns as typical living beings. To prevent inbreeding, they seek out other humans or Servants to mate with, including the Master, of course.

They’re convinced that the only way to attain enlightenment and achieve divinity is through the relentless accumulation of merits by servitude. Because of their enormous population, one Master alone would be insufficient to sustain them all. As a result, they extend their service to other individuals, treating them as Masters to meet their needs. They dream of growing their community to the point of infesting the entire planet and serve every existing human. As such, it’s unknown whether their real goal is reproduction or enlightenment.

As rats, they harbor a deep hatred for cats and have taken it upon themselves to protect humanity from being charmed and brainwashed by cats plotting to take over the world with their cuteness. That said, they have to yet face a cat since their summoning. The idea fills them with dread.

### General Armaments

Claws, teeth, lucky-bags (the oversized white bag featured in their extra attack.)

### Connections with Characters

#### India and Buddhist-related Heroic Spirits

#### Tamamo Cat
