### Meritorious Servitude{{n1}}: A

Capable of handling most household tasks, though none with exceptional skill. They’re only truly exceptional at preparing rice balls. By performing meritorious deeds, their spiritual core will ascend, even if only slightly... At least, that’s what they hope.

### For The Benefit of All Sattvas{{n2}}: A

One may be blessed with short-lived good fortune by performing a ritual in adoration of Daikokuten and presenting offerings. Yet, calling upon this ability may prove quite stressful, given that it involves inconveniencing the swamped original bearer of the power.

### Squeakerland: B

A hidden underground space that can function as a magical workshop, subterranean passage, burrow and anything else. Sometimes a escape route, other times a pitfall. A cunning ability that can be wielded for both offensive and defensive purposes.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} In Buddhism, “merit” is a kind of positive karma, a form of positive conditioning. It leads to positive outcomes. Someone who performs meritorious acts with a virtuous mind will eventually receive this good in return and achieve Enlightenment. Not because you have accumulated merits like credits, but because, by being a good person, you eventually reach Enlightenment on your own. You can see where joke is.
2. {{note2}} An excerpt from the Threefold Refuge Mantra; “I take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Until I attain Enlightenment. By merit accumulations from practicing generosity and the other perfections. May I attain Enlightenment, for the benefit of all sentient beings.”
