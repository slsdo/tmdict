### Personality

The mother of beasts, who deems humanity unnecessary. Cruel and cold-hearted, yet her love for animals is genuine and profoundly deep, even though she never shows it outwardly. Being the embodiment of harsh and unforgiving nature, she (rarely) indulges them. Despite her cruelty, she retains a small trace of kindness, as she is still, at her core, Tamamo-no-Mae.

Her guiding principles are the rejection of humanity and disregard for human rights. She despises the human race, viewing all human actions as filthy, but not because filth disgusts her. In fact, there are certain pleasures that can only be enjoyed because they are dirty.

### Setting

Beast IV: L originally came into existence as the collective death throes of the land and animals devastated by the Tunguska event. The agony of the land, blown away in an instant… The cries of animals who perished, powerless against their fate… These combined and lingered, forming a residual Spirit Origin, or perhaps a prototypical Singularity, that remained as a distortion in spacetime at ground zero.

Had that been the extent of her existence, she would likely have faded away unnoticed. However, on January 1st, 2017, when the previous Beast IV’s seat became vacant, she was counted among the candidates and transformed into an Evil of Humanity. Taking Tamamo-no-Mae, a Nature Spirit, as her reference, she shaped a new Alter Ego Spirit Origin and began her campaign to exterminate humanity. Her goal: the complete severance of all ties between the human world and the collective will of animals (including humans themselves, of course). In a way, it was like serving a divorce notice to humanity.

Her ultimate aim was to witness the extinction of modern mankind from afar while constructing a world of “new animals”—creatures who neither harmed humans nor were harmed by them—in Earth’s existing environment.

While Beast IV appears in the form of a beast, her true essence is the land itself. She presides over both a sanctuary nurturing animal life, and a zone of slaughter, where animals are killed. As such, it would not be inaccurate to call Beast IV the “Eighth Lostbelt.”

### Goal as an Enemy

A mysterious beauty who, despite knowing the true identity of the Foreign God, chose to align herself as a collaborator. She doesn’t care whether Proper Human History is erased by the Foreign God or replaced by one of the Lostbelts. This is because, as a juvenile Beast, she has no particular desire to wipe out humanity herself; rather, she wants to enjoy watching humanity fade away.

As a candidate for the position of Beast IV, she is somewhat of a rival to Primate Murder, the original Beast IV. (Remember, Beast IV is an Evil of Humanity associated with nature and animals.)

・Small Public-Facing Goals

A wickedly capable woman who, while cheering on the Crypters as a Disciple of the Foreign God, also made her own attempts to eliminate Chaldea. Unlike the other Alter Egos, she possesses the ability to freely travel between Lostbelts.

・Grand Secret Goal

Her secret agenda is to travel across the various Lostbelts as an Alter Ego and collect the grotesque monsters unique to each one. These creatures are stored within her tails and become familiars that she can summon at will. Her goal in doing so is to recreate the legend of the great nine-tailed fox, which is said to have birthed every supernatural creature in Japan from its tails. However, she found merely copying the legend too dull, so…

“As one who rejects humanity in every form, my children should be beings that never existed in human history.”

That’s why Beast IV: L chose to craft her familiars from lifeforms that could only exist within Lostbelts. She traveled between Lostbelts, killing the monsters that lived there and incorporating them into her tails. With each set of Lostbelt data she acquired, she gained a new tail, and can now freely use her Russian, Scandinavian, and Chinese tails to summon and control enemies from each Lostbelt.

Every enemy Beast IV: L creates bears an “NFF Services” sticker, making it unmistakably clear where they originate.

### Dialogue Examples

“Call out the name of the beast. As if it were your duty, as if it were your amusement. As proud and haughty as a beast.”

“Curses of death, wicked enchantments, weapons and machines. How pitiful the weak truly are.”

“Gather out your cries. Gather your prayers. Let the filthy human’s beloved toy be struck by the hammer that falls from the sky. It all ends here.”

“Gather your rage. Gather your curses. May an endless, ignorant hell befall the human’s boundless toy! Fuhahahahahaha!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Koyanskaya, initially thought to be one of the three Alter Egos serving the Foreign God, was not actually bound by that role. She only pretended to be one of them.

After the Solomon incident, she manifested independently in Russia as a juvenile Beast candidate to take the place of Beast IV. Though she resembled Tamamo-no-Mae, and was thought to be one of the Tamamo Nine, this was a mislead. In reality, Koyanskaya was a Nature Spirit, born from the cries and pain of the animals and land destroyed during the Tunguska explosion. The collective resentment of the animals persecuted by humans gathered and took form. In this process, Tamamo-no-Mae’s Spirit Origin, which shared a similar essence of vengeance against humans, was used as the vessel.

Even Tamamo-no-Mae herself was puzzled by the resemblance, thinking, “I don’t recall this tail… but it does seem like me. Maybe she’s my Alter?”

However, Koyanskaya didn’t consider herself a clone or copy of Tamamo. She insisted she was a different being entirely, simply using Tamamo as a reference for her form.

After establishing a company with the goal of eradicating humanity, she was scouted by ○○○○○○ and subsequently aligned her plans with theirs. While she appeared to assist in the battle between Chaldea and ○○○○○○, her true enjoyment came from watching both sides struggle. Rather than directly competing, Koyanskaya shifted to observing their “mutual destruction”.

(○○○○○○ was also born from human thought.)

Her true form wasn’t fox-like, but more akin to a rabbit. With a core based on the soul of a rabbit, a creature destined to be prey, Koyanskaya harbored a certain sympathy for prey animals and a more ruthless attitude toward predators, whether ally or foe.

As the Foreign God and Chaldea fought, Koyanskaya’s ultimate ambition was to absorb both sides and rise as a new Beast of Humanity. Her personal goal wasn’t simply to act as Beast IV: L, but to ascend as Koyanskaya herself. In her ideal scenario, Chaldea would win, and she would “sew the Master who saved humanity into her ninth tail,” forcing them to watch as humanity perished. “That would be the perfect dessert!♡”

—But.

Things changed when her friend Murian from the Sixth Lostbelt asked her to protect Faerie Britain. To save Britain, she had to protect Chaldea (or the Storm Border) from Cernunnos, as they were the only hope for Britain’s salvation. However, soon after, she was injected with Cernunnos’ accumulated “stagnation” due to Oberon’s scheme, causing her Spirit Origin to swell uncontrollably. No longer able to manage her own power, Koyanskaya was forced to retreat from the Sixth Lostbelt.

Afterward, Koyanskaya, now in a rampaging state, had no choice but to metamorphose into her adult Beast form prematurely and hide in the Anti-Primate Biosphere she’d secretly set up on the blank Earth.

Even though Koyanskaya had established herself as a Beast, she remained juvenile at her core and never became a full disaster for humanity. Her refusal to directly attack humanity, due to her pride as a Beast of Affection, meant she never earned a true Beast name.

Thus, her class was ultimately denied, and the title of “nation-ruining beauty” was proven false. In the end, she was simply a Beast of Affection who couldn’t completely sever ties with humankind, walking alongside human history instead of destroying it. Her title was Beast IV: Lost—a beast with affection who failed to become the seventh of the Evils of Humanity.
