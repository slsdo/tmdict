### Independent Manifestation: B

A skill that allows one to manifest in the world without outside help. Although Beast IV: L did not come into existence through human society flourishing, she still acquried this skill by virtue of coming to Earth as a meteorite from space. Originally coming from a different world (or zone), Beast IV: L was easily able to break through the walls surrounding each Lostbelt’s world, allowing her to leap and transfer between them as she pleased.

### Authority of Beasts: E

Also called an “anti-humanity” skill. This is what gives Beast IV: L her Beast trait while she’s stepping into her Fair-faced Golden Fox aspect.

### Nega-Self: C

An Authority that denies consciousness and will in animals. Although the Beast of Affection generated and discharged the various animals she had incorporated from her own cells, she not only forbade them from creating families and genealogies, she even refused to let them have their own sense of self. In effect, she forbids all of her kin from ever evolving through growth, experience, or mixing their DNA.
