### Massacring Technique (Human): A

A variant of the skill possessed by Archimedes, one of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity. Despite his own wishes, Archimedes can fashion weapons of mass slaughter exceeding the technology of the era according to his desires, while Beast IV: L willingly acquired it. This skill allows its user to freely wield humanity’s weapons in whatever era the user may find herself, while augmenting them to be several times more powerful than they would be in human hands.

As befitting for a skill tied to an “Evil of Humanity”, it theoretically indicates that the humanity of that era can’t compete against it. But since it’s ultimately a skill designed to dominate humanity, it doesn’t hold absolute power against Servants.

### NFF Services: EX

A unique skill of Beast IV: L, who schemes to turn herself into the new Golden White Face. It allows her to use those who have been expelled from Proper Human History—those deemed “unpermitted to exist”—as her own tools, making it an authority suited to a new era of great transformation.

…Though it sounds grand, in essence, it’s simply a form of familiar creation. Just as the nine-tailed fox leads all pipe foxes, Beast IV: L planned to become the queen of the various monstrosities born only in Lostbelts. She can incorporate any fur-covered lifeform into the tail’s library, which enables her to create and command new familiars.

### Goddess Morph: B

The highest-ranking Morph skill. It allows one to transform into a goddess. Since the divine Tamamo-no-Mae serves as the prototype, this skill enables her transformation from a “nature spirit” to a “divine spirit.”

### Morph: EX

The ability to transform not only herself, but even every creature born from her body. This also enables her to arrange her “children’s” DNA and create brand new life-forms.
