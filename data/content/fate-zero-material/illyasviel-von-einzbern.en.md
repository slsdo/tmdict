The daughter of Irisviel and Emiya Kiritsugu, and one of the heroines of the Fifth Holy Grail War.
…That’s not a lie, dammit! The Illya route exists in all of our hearts!
Anyway, though there vague insinuations about it even in *Fate/stay night*, in *Fate/Zero* the shocking matter of Illya’s age was revealed right off the bat.
As for why Saber didn’t show Illya any sort of leniency in the fifth war, that’s because she had never actually asked Iri what her daughter’s name was, and she thought Illya looked far too childish to be the same girl—she assumed that the girl she had seen riding on Kiritsugu’s shoulders ten years ago would have developed into a voluptuous women like her mother by then. So, she must have seen Illya as just another unrelated Einzbern homunculus.
…Shut up, it’s not a lame excuse!
