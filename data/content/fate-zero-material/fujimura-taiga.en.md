The secret heroine of *Fate/Zero*. One fateful winter day, a cask of extremely high-quality wine was stolen from the liquor store run by the family of one of her classmates. In response, she took up her Tora-Shinai and gallantly dashed out into the nighttime Fuyuki, where bizarre murderers and urban guerrillas ran rampant. Despite the danger, she actually accomplished quite a lot, with her list of heroic deeds ranging from catching an underwear thief to saving a lost puppy. And due to the butterfly effect, her furious charge through town also prevented a devastating earthquake, enshrined a sea god, and even caused a huge asteroid on a collision course with Fuyuki to vanish without a trace. But though she averted disaster after disaster at a frightening pace, sadly, this epic saga can only be deciphered by reading between the lines with spiritual vision.
