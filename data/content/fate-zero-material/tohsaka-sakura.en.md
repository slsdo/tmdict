She had already become Matou Sakura by the time she appeared in *Fate/Zero*, but, well, I’ve always wanted to use this name. Somehow, it makes her seem more gallant, like… Tohyama Sakura, or something.
Though she only showed up twice, at the beginning and the end of the book, when you consider the fact that the whooooole time she was off-screen she was being tortured in a worm hell that violates child pornography laws, well, even in *Fate/Zero* her misery index probably rates higher than anyone else’s. Also, the Character Material book that was released right when I was in the middle of writing had a cute illustration of Sakura as a child in it. When I saw it, I thought, “Right now, I’m creating such a cruel world for this girl!” It was a huge load on my spirit. You’re so mean, Mr. Takeuchi. Bully me some more!
By the way, in the first draft, Kariya’s death was much more inhumane. It was one of the few scenes that ended up being totally vetoed by the original author. I can still hear him screaming for my blood even now…! As a result, Sakura’s monologue was toned down considerably. No, really, it was! I swear!
