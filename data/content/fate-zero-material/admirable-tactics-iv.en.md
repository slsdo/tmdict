The fourth entry in a super-popular series of war games set during World War II, where players control the Axis powers and fight against the Allies. The subtitle is “The Melancholy of Dr. Porsche.”
Since the game systems had already reached the limits of complexity and difficulty in the previous installment, this newest version simply added more nations, stages, and maps. And with new units like the Focke-Wulf Triebflügel, the V-3 cannon, and a clone of the Führer himself, it surpassed the realm of war games and became a chaotic melting pot that defies description. Even now, it enjoys a small but intensely dedicated fanbase.
