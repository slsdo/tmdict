*Fate/Zero*’s other protagonist. When I saw the young Kirei next to Kiritsugu in the material book that came with first print editions of Fate/stay night, with his short hair and earrings, well, my heart turned somersaults in my chest. It’s part of what inspired me to write *Fate/Zero* in the first place.
To write him, I just got rid of the older Kirei’s state of enlightenment and composure, and replaced them with hesitation and inner turmoil. In *Zero*, when he engages in self-introspection his memories of the past are distorted, especially in regards to his wife. Accordingly, the more philosophic self-analysis from *Fate/stay night* is probably a better reflection of his true inner self.
In the first draft, I was a bit too cognizant of his height from the original story, and kept indiscriminately using words like “gigantic,” “hulking,” and “towering” to describe him. As a result, I was called in by Type Moon
and chastised for misrepresenting Kirei’s image, and his height ended up casually being changed.
Originally he was taught baji quan by his father, Risei, as a form of spiritual improvement, but through his blood-drenched experiences as an executor it was gradually sublimed into a warped version specialized at destroying the human body. Needless to say, the fact that he was so far off from his father’s ideal form of kung fu was probably just one more thing he could not forgive himself for during his youth.
