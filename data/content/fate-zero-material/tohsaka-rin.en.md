Tohsaka Tokiomi’s eldest daughter. The younger form of one of the heroines from the original story.
During *Fate/Zero*, Rin’s level of understanding of the “Holy Grail War” is about the same as Shirou’s was during *Fate/stay night*. That is, while it might seem like she knows what’s going on, she really doesn’t.
In the young Rin’s eyes, her father Tokiomi was a great magus deserving of love and respect. She did not yet understand the ruthlessness and cruelty that stemmed from that ideal. If her father had survived long enough for her to comprehend that aspect of him, it surely would have had a grave effect on her own personality. But whether she chose to rebel against that inhumanity and turn her back on sorcery itself, or chose to embrace it fully, becoming a perfect, cold-hearted magus like her father—the only certainty is that for her, happiness would be nothing more than the fleeting dream of a far off parallel world.
