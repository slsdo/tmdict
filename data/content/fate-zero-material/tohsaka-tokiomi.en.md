The fifth Tohsaka family head. Had everything gone according to plan, he would have been the man to finish the Holy Grail War once and for all.
He started making preparations for the Fourth Holy Grail War long before it ever began. But although he had set up everything perfectly in his favor, he was tragically killed by his trusted ally, Kotomine Kirei. Well, seeing as how the one who tempted Kirei into defecting in the first place was Gilgamesh, in a sense you could say Tokiomi died due to a lack of compatibility with his Servant.
Tokiomi and his predecessor made a conscious effort to commercialize their spiritual lands, and the unnatural economic success of every business situated there naturally led to exorbitant rental fees, which were collected by the Tohsaka. Of course, as far as Tokiomi was concerned, the fact that the “harvests of all the tenant farmers tilling the Tohsaka land” were protected from bad luck and natural disasters by the Tohsaka’s careful management of the ley lines, meant that taxing them like this was his natural right. Truly, it was a 20th century feudal system made possible through sorcery. Although, even among the Second Owners of other lands,
very few have ever seen monetary returns like those made by the Tohsaka.
After Tokiomi’s death, these assets were passed on to Aoi, and after Aoi’s death they were passed on once more to Rin. Or at least, they should have been, but thanks to her legal guardian Kirei’s naïve honesty and crude management, most of the valuable property was lost to other people. Then again, as a priest who values honest poverty, he probably thought it would be good for her from an educational standpoint. Just another thing for Rin to wallop him for, I guess.
