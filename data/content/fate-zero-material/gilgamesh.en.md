The Archer class Servant of the Fourth Holy Grail War. Though he was summoned by Tohsaka Tokiomi, he ended up deserting his master and re-contracting with Kotomine Kirei. He is the strongest character in both *Fate/stay night* and *Fate/Zero*.
In the boy-meets-girl story of the original *Fate/stay night* he was forced to yield to the universal law of “love conquers all,” but in *Fate/Zero* he’s free to show off his overwhelming, cheat-like strength without restraint. He could have ended the war in a single night if he truly desired to do so. But then, careless pride is the king’s prerogative, and getting serious over something as frivolous as a wish-granter would be unbecoming. So, taking that into account, it sort of balances out the huge disparity in firepower… I guess?
Also, the reason that he was able to splendidly escape after being swallowed by Angra Mainyu at the end of *Fate/Zero* despite succumbing to the same thing in the Sakura route of Fate/stay night is because in the latter he was distracted by the presence of a naked girl.
…Just kidding! Actually, it was due to the difference in power between the “mud,” which was cut off from its source, and the “shadow” which was connected directly to it.
