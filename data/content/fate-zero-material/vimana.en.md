His Highness the King of Heroes’ mobile aerial weapon, which took flight for the first time in volume three. A high-tech Noble Phantasm from India that would even put Area 51 to shame. It uses solar energy produced by mercury-powered sun crystals to move. In ancient Indian mythology it came fully loaded with wondrous weapons ranging from ancient machine guns to ancient nuclear warheads, all of which are surely stashed away in the King of Heroes’ treasury.
