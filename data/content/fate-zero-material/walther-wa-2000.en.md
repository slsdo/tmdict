The sniper rifle used by Emiya Kiritsugu in the Holy Grail War. Despite being relatively compact due to its bullpup design, it is an extremely heavy and hard to use weapon. On top of that, Kiritsugu’s is decked out with a preposterous night vision system. The night vision scopes that existed during the time period of the Fourth Holy Grail War were a long way off from where they are today, and were often bulkier and heavier than the guns they were attached to. Also, one of the gun’s major flaws was its prohibitive cost, which is one of the reasons it never saw widespread use, but thanks to the Einzberns’ considerable funds that was no problem at all. And besides, it was probably less expensive than running telephone lines all the way out to a castle in the middle of nowhere.
