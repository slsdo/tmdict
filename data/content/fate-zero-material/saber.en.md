A symbol-like existence. Without her, *Fate* wouldn’t be *Fate*. However, in *Fate/Zero* her kingly shell is still intact, and she plays the role of a hero instead of a heroine.
Over the course of *Zero* she experienced neglect play and tentacle play, was stalked, slandered, leered at, and preached at by drunks, and to top it all off the scoundrel who ambushed her at the very end turned out to be a former ally. It’s no exaggeration to say that the entirety of *Zero* is built on her suffering. Still, all of that was for the sake of enjoying Shirou’s delicious cooking ten years down the line. Or at least, that’s the excuse I gave to the Saber Maid figure that silently watched over my furious writing every day. If it had been the plain clothes version, I definitely wouldn’t have been able to finish the story. Even just seeing one in a store window was enough to make me drop to my knees, ashamed of my own ugliness, and yell to the heavens, “What kind of man am I, bullying such a pure and beautiful young girl like this!?”
By the way, about Saber’s suit. When I first imagined it, for some reason I just naturally assumed it would be a tuxedo. But after the art actually came in, I ended up settling on the current not-too-mannish traditional suit. Thinking about it now, making her patrol around a rustic suburban city like Fuyuki in full party dress would have been extraordinarily embarrassing for her, so it was probably the right call.
