The three-way confrontation between Saber, Gil, and Alexander in volume 2. A serious discussion under the guise of a drinking party. Well, it might not have looked that way to bystanders, but the three of them were all definitely being serious in their own way.
I’d actually been planning this scene ever since the very first draft proposal, trying to think of the best way to handle it. After all, if I’d just had them all duke it out with their ridiculously destructive Noble Phantasms, they’d kill each other long before they ever reached an understanding through battle.
…But now that I think about it, it just ended up turning into a social mixer to kick off Gil and Saber’s relationship, didn’t it?
