The motorcycle that Emiya Kiritsugu prepared for his Servant. Since it underwent excessive tuning without any regard for usability, a normal person trying to ride it would just end up killing themselves. Maiya must have brought it into town on a truck, then pushed it from the front gate to the courtyard.
The president of Nitro+, Digitarou, was responsible for picking out and configuring the vehicle model.
By the way, at one point during the consultation stage, Mr. Takeuchi had just gotten back from seeing the new *Ghost Rider* movie and wouldn’t stop going on about how awesome it would be if Saber’s motorcycle could transform too, but, uh… honestly it seemed like it would be a lot of trouble. I was really glad I managed to get out of writing that one!
