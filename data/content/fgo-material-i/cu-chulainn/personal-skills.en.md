### Battle Continuation: A

He is bad at giving up. This is not a method{{n1}} to preserve one’s own dominance, but simply the karma{{n2}} that induces the pride of Celt warriors who does not stop fighting until their last breath. It’s possible for him to fight even on the verge of death, surviving as long as his injury is not decisively lethal.

### Protections from Arrows: B

Protection against projectiles.
As long as the shooter is within his visibility, he would be able to seize all manners of thrown weapons with his bare eye and deal with them. However, it is not applicable to super long distance direct attacks or attacks with extensive range.{{n3}}

### Disengage: C{{n4}}

The ability to withdraw from battle.
It also returns disadvantageous battle to the turn it began (turn 1) and skill conditions to its initial values.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} what is even 生き汚い - I got 自分の利益や優位を保とうとする様と言う感じの意味 but could appreciate a second look from more native moonruners.
2. {{note2}} 業 - It’s a Buddhist term that means karma, but it can also mean deed, work, performance, act. I feel like karma is the more correct one here considering Cu is big on this sort of stuffs, but native moonruners do correct me if im wrong.
3. {{note3}} Add on info from CM3: He can deal with most projectiles even in conditions where the opponent cannot be visually seen. Even if the battle with Hasan Sabbaha, he cancelled the throwing swords hurled from the darkness. As long as the attack is a thrown type, he can avoid even Noble Phantasms, but he can’t gain the effects of this protection with respect to wide range attack types where the attack range of the weapon explodes on impact, or a direct attack by a weapon that has simply long reach.
4. {{note4}} Just a trivia, but Restart or Re-engage is actually a closer translation.
