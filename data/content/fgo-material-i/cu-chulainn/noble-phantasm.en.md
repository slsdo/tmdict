Gáe Bolg.
Hitting correction +100. Upon hitting, adds the damage in proportion to the enemy’s HP.{{n1}}
The spear of curse that would always pierce through the enemy’s heart once it’s thrusted. The thorn of certain death utilizing the demonic spear Gae Bolg.
Its true nature is the demonic technique, where the spear was unleashed towards the enemy after the spear had already struck the enemy’s heart. In other words, the reversal of cause and effect.
It is the “spear that possess the effect of already striking the heart, thus no matter what the enemy would do it would always pierce through it.”
Because the action is done after creating the result, neither defense nor evasion is possible against it.
In evading Gae Bolg, what needed is not high agility, but luck; the ability to change fate before Gae Bolg is invoked. The magical energy needed for this Noble Phantasm activation is low, and its extreme efficiency of killing in each blow makes for an excellent Noble Phantasm.

1. {{note1}} Could also mean stamina or physical strength but wouldn’t make sense on the context here and what we know of GB already.
