Gáe Bolg. The spear of causality reversal. A crimson lance handed by his mentor Scáthach, as well as a certain kill spear technique.
It has two methods of attacking, an Anti-Unit thrust, and an Anti-Army throw.
Although it’s not as if it was being sealed, for whatever reason, Cú Chulainn doesn’t use it when attacking normally. Only when he is convinced he can give the target a decisive strike with his 『trump card』, he wields the crimson spear with a full-power True Name release.
