### Personality

A coarse but likable man. He doesn’t talk about『who is at the top』 between good people or villains, but since his roots lean towards justice, he’s not mature enough to understand the unreasonableness of the world and the equality of good and evil. He’s also an animal tamer. Specially compatible with dogs and wolves.
Compared with the Lancer summoned with the same True Name, he’s equipped with heavy armor. But still exceeds the Agility parameter of 『that one』 with an A+. It’s not a performance difference of the body, but the youthful and proactive personality can be thought to lead to a slight difference.
His feelings and emotions regarding his mentor Scáthach occupy a somewhat bigger place in his heart than 『that one』 Lancer’s. It’s unknown whether it is due to youth or due to the season. Truly the unreasonableness of the world, is it impossible to recognize the equality of good and evil……

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He finds the existence of a Master challenged to restore humanity likable, and wouldn’t doubt to lend them his power. But, be careful. The reactions aren’t completely applied in the same way as with『that one』 Lancer with the same True Name.

### Dialogue Examples

「Ulster’s Cú Chulainn. Lancer. For starters, nice to meetcha.」
「The hound of Culann is me. Yeah, I’ll bite to death. The enemies, that’s it.」
「Just because we’re Heroic Spirits of 『the same hero』, it doesn’t mean the same one will always come. Whaat, you’ll soon get used to it.」
「You, do you like any animal? I, let’s see ―― dogs, it is. Hounds in particular are good.」
「I don’t really dislike it, but women always bring bad luck. But, a nice woman is attractive ’cause of that too. For real, ain’t there anything worse?」

### Historical Image · Character Image

He seems to be the very same person as the Lancer with the same True Name, but ―― his body and personality are seemingly slightly younger than 『that one』.

### Connections with Characters

#### Scáthach

Compared to the homonym Heroic Spirit, his obsession with her is a bit stronger.

#### Medb

Perhaps because his feeling of annoyance when followed around is thinner, he doesn’t put a bad face even if she’s in front of him.

#### Artoria

…… A woman? The Holy Sword Wielder?
