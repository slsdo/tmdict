Bellerophon.
Increases all ability values by 1 rank upon usage, and increases armor class by 100.
It is utilized on a beast from the age of the gods; a physical attack that pulverizes the enemies by means of a super charge.
While originally Pegasus was a gift given by the sea god to Medusa, it is also said that Pegasus was born of the blood dripping from Medusa’s severed neck as she was exterminated by Perseus.
By means of Pegasus’ divine protection, upon riding defense power is also raised; the highest level of Noble Phantasm in terms of combination of offense and defense.
In addition, Bellerophon was also the name of a youth who is known to have ridden Pegasus in Greek mythology.

(A bit of trivia but even Gorgon’s bond CE also alludes to the question of whether Pegasus (& Chrysaor) are gift from Poseidon or something born out of Medusa)

Bloodfort Andromeda.
A mystical temple that had been constructed in the “Shapeless Isle” where the three Gorgon Sisters had been exiled to.
The temple, known to petrify those who embark on the island and devour them, was a boundary field constructed by the Mystic Eyes Medusa possessed.
By magnification of the Mystic Eyes’ projection, a fixed field is substituted into “the inside of her eyes”, and the life force of those inside it is plundered.
An absorption power that literally “dissolves the body” of ordinary persons without any Magic Resistance. Even Heroic Spirits will have their life force plundered as long as they are inside the barrier.
In FateGO it is utilized as her third skill, but because its true name is not released, its output value falls.
