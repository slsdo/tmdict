### Personality

Taciturn and blunt.
Concealing her eyes with a mask, she is a hard one to understand. However, it is not that she doesn’t have much in the ways of emotion; rather, she is the type that thinks too much and ended up stuffed with emotion inside.
Furthermore, her mask is not simply for hiding her eyes, but also for sealing her “Mystic Eyes Cybele” that petrifies anything they gaze at; the Mystic Eyes slaying Noble Phantasm “Dark Temple (Breaker Gorgon)”.
In battle, she is ruthless and without mercy, willing to prey on unrelated innocents without hesitation if it’s by her Master order in the Holy Grail War.
On the other hand, she displays a degree of kindness to those who is not antagonistic towards her Master.
Her appearing indifferent and coldblooded is simply due to her feeling it to be bothersome otherwise, said Artoria.
She likes alcohol, and her hobby is reading.
Being summoned as Rider, it seemed like she had grown a fondness towards bicycle.
Due to being pushed around by her cruel and willful sisters, Stheno and Euryale, she ended up ingrained with a pessimistic nature. It seemed that this sort of power relationship doesn’t change even after they became Heroic Spirit, with her being abused with those two’s unreasonable demands even in Chaldea.
Although she is a tall and beautiful woman with outstanding build, her standard for beauty is “small and cute”; due to that, she holds a complex towards her own height and grown-up build. As she materialize, that complex of her ended up stirred towards girls with petite build such as Artoria.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She is, at the very least, display loyalty towards the Master. One that borders desperation.
Even if she thinks that there is something wrong with her Master’s standpoint or orders, she is capable of serving them while killing her own personal feelings.
Ferocious and terrifying, yet beautiful. Perhaps similar to that of a Doberman.
She is fundamentally indifferent towards humans other than her Master, but she opens her heart to those she deemed would not injure her Master.

### Dialogue Examples

“As aggravating it may be, soldiers do not get to choose their superior. Facing forwards means not of voicing one’s displeasure, but of seeking virtue, no? …Although, it is only in the case that someone like that actually exists.”
“Even something like nonchalant gesture hinders my leg.”
“Fufu. Now now, don’t slouch your back.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The youngest daughter of the three Gorgon sisters that appears in the Greek mythology, Medusa.
An unorthodox Heroic Spirit; rather, she is an opponent of mankind, one known as anti-hero.
Previously she had been a native earth mother goddess, but due to the scheme of the Olympians and the fanaticism of the people, she made a getaway to the Shapeless Isle together with her two sisters.
For the sake of protecting her elder sisters, who have no fighting ability, she had continued on the endeavour of becoming stronger, until finally. Medusa was reduced to a snake monster that turns everything she gazes at into stone. She then was cornered by the hero Perseus by means of his many Noble Phantasms, and ended up having her neck severed.
Both of her sisters had been “perfect” goddess from birth, and so they did not grow; however, Medusa herself did grow due to being an “imperfect” goddess. That is the cause of her looking older than her elder sisters.

### Role within the Game

She did not make any standing out appearance up to 5th chapter, but each of her sisters did appear; Stheno as an Assassin during the 2nd chapter of “Empire of Eternal Madness, Septem” and Euryale as an Archer during the 3rd chapter of “Sealed Ends of the Four Seas, Okeanos”, and etc. The sisters’ heartwarming (?) episodes are depicted in interlude stories and others.

### Role in Past Works

In “Fate/stay night”, she appears as the Servant of the Matou clan’s magus. Although there are route where she immediately leave the stage, there is also a route where she joins the protagonist. In “Fate/hollow ataraxia”, she freeloads in the protagonist’s house together with her Master while working part-time in an antique store, completely adapting into a livelihood in Fuyuki City. The same work’s “Gorgon’s Storage” episode also depicts the bullied younger sister from when she was still living together with her elder sisters.

### Connections with Characters

Even though every day they still pushed her around, those are days filled with happiness.

If he comes he’s dead.
