##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Add on info from Emiya ingame profile:
  Magic: C (conditionally A+)
  A magic that reproduces tools by his image for but several minutes.
  The pair of swords that Archer favored, Kanshou and Bakuya, was something created by means of projection magic as well.
  Its rank rapidly increases only when the projection subject is categorized as “sword”.
  Through the special trait of “able to prepare counterfeits many times over”, Emiya momentarily increases the power of the projected Noble Phantasm by making them detonates.
