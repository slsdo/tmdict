Unlimited Blade Works.
It is not an arsenal, but instead a special type of magic known as reality marble.
Reality marble is something that, for a certain period of time, overwrite reality with the user’s own mental world.
In Emiya’s case, all the weapons that he had seen in life are then and there immediately reproduced and accumulated. However, their ranks are decreased by one.
It is possible to reproduce defensive armament; however, it requires magical energy two to three times the amount needed for normal projection.
The pair of swords that Archer favored, “Kanshou and Bakuya”, was something created by means of projection magic as well
There are others as well, such as the shooting type mystic sword, the “Fake Spiral Sword (Caladbolg II)” and the tracking type mystic sword, the “Hound of the Red Plains (Hrunting)”.
Perhaps during his life it was common for him to have his arms customized; the projected Noble Phantasms appears to have been arranged in order to make them easier to use as well.
