In the planning of his saint graph ascension evolution design, the first and the second was, well, I’d manage it one way or the other, but the third stage was pretty hard. The last form a character grows into is, to give it to you straight, something I’d like to land right in the center of what makes said character a character.
For Emiya, as expected I’d want to give his last ascension his usual red appearance, so either way I settled with the troublesome plan of “original design renewal” as the concept. (Takeuchi Takashi)
