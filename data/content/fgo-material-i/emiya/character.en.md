### Personality

Sarcastic and pessimistic. A realist that performs his job dispassionately.
However, he is not a workaholic, and there is a side of him that while showing hypocritical courtesy also cares and worries about others.
It appears that the nihilistic jest that he speaks of during critical moments are done while reading the place and situation.
That being said, due to being fundamentally a cool-headed professional, he gives off an image not unlike a law enforcer agent that puts aside his personal feeling during the job.
His ever austere expression is probably caused due to such an impairment.
He approves of logical tactics and justice in general, but his origin is the ideal of “wanting to save everyone”.
On top of his position as a “guardian”, who bears the role of steering away the ruin that is the annihilation of mankind, he had had enough of having to see mankind’s ugliness through endlessly murder.
However, while he may speak of regret of becoming a “guardian”, the choices that he makes are always a fight for the sake of protecting others, and he is firm in confronting the danger towards the world and prioritizing his duty as a “guardian” as he throws away his own motive and interest.
He had been established as a knight of the bow, but originally he was a magus.
His standard weapon being a bow appears to not due to his own strength as a Heroic Spirit amounting to that much, but as a result of his combat style eventually settling down with sniping from afar.
As a magus, he utilizes the projection magic--------a magic that reproduces tools by his image for but several minutes; a faker who imitates countless of famed and mystical swords.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As a Servant, he makes it his principle to properly attend to his Master, dispassionately performing his job no matter what sorts of person the Master is.
He has no wish to entrust upon the Holy Grail, for he is different from the other Heroic Spirit, in that he died and became a Heroic Spirit by fulfilling his wish.
That being said, it is not as if he is completely without desire; when he was summoned to the Fifth Holy Grail War in the city of Fuyuki, he had been asked of what he wish for, and he replied in a joking manner with “eternal world peace”.
An expert of domestic chores; should he be summoned by a magus with low ability in daily life, it would not be an unusual situation for him to completely manage all matters in regards to daily chores, albeit with complaints.
He has one other wish that makes him respond to the Holy Grail War summoning, but that is a story for another time.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Archer; here in response to your summon.
So you are my employer this time? Ah, just the name is enough. We’d eventually be able to find out about each other’s personality whether or not we want to.”
“I’d prefer to avoid pointless battles. The basis would be it being a waste of time, of magical energy, and above all, a disappointment from the incompetence on my Master’s part.”
“See, this is how it ends! From the beginning, you don’t know how to save others, you don’t have anyone to save! Know that this embodiment of unsightly justice is the very ruin of what you once were!”
“No matter what sort of predicament it is, there is always a way to survive it. The likes of despair are nothing but thoughtless words of those who just wants to comfort themselves.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Due to his source being different from the other Heroic Spirit, one cannot say that he is a Heroic Spirit in the traditional sense.
If pressed to say, then his source would be the works of “Fate/stay night”.
He is an existence known as “guardians”, a defense apparatus brought about by mankind’s unconsciousness for the continuation of their existence.
In short, he is someone chosen by the the unconsciousness of the nameless mass, their faceless representative.
“Should an evil that accelerates the downfall of humanity appears, then the very elements that had allowed said evil to come to be shall all be eliminated.” Guardians materialize and perform their job with that as their objective.
They, who thwart the unseen danger of humanity’s downfall, may very well be the repairman of the era or such.{{n1}}
The moment this deterrent cease to work, the downfall shall advance in haste and it would be honored as the “end” where mankind would sooner or later go beyond recovery.
As for why this magus ended up becoming a part of the guardians. The details are told pieces by pieces in the works of “Fate” series, but the whole story has yet to come to light.

### Role within the Game

He made an appearance in Fuyuki City, which he had a deep connection with, which was the stage for the prologue “Ablazed Contaminated City Fuyuki”, while also act in a manner of protecting Artoria Pendragon (Alter) whom he is deeply tied with.
In his interlude story, as “a veteran who had walked through numerous Holy Grail Wars” he gives a lecture to the protagonist and Mashu in regards to the structure of Heroic Spirit and Holy Grail War, appearing as someone who is fond of teaching and caring for others.

### Role in Past Works

Although the Emiya that appears in “Fate/stay night” and Emiya who appears in “Fate/EXTRA” are very much the same person, the foundation of their setting is different. It was quite a complicated relation.

For the history in “Fate/stay night” and “Fate/EXTRA” had already diverged starting from the year of 1970.
