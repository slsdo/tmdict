Excalibur.
A sword of light. It is not a man-made weapon, but a Divine Construct forged by the planet. Although managed by the hands of fairies, the mage Merlin entrusted it to king Arthur as an intermediary.
A Noble Phantasm that stands at the top in the category of holy swords.
A holy sword that, by summoning the owner’s mana as “light”, increases momentum by means of convergence/acceleration, and makes possible to exert magical power on the level of a Divine Spirit.
That huge magic power gives heat not only by the tip, and as a result is taken as a wave of light that scratches the ground. It could be also said to be a directional energy weapon.
It is said that this sword that was birthed (forged) in the inner sea of the planet, only exerts its true power only with the appearance of a foreign enemy that threatens the planet.
