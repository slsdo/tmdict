While making the Servant pictures for 『FateGO』, what bothered me in special was the evolutionary design of the Spirit Origin.
Specially with an already existing character, adding extra elements to a familiar design without changing the silhouette, and putting three stages of change was very difficult.
With Artoria’s evolutionary design, I thought about various things like plainclothes or a dress, but in the end I settled with the simple royal road design. It’s not a change for the better, but I think that’s the role of Artoria in FateGO. (Takeuchi Takashi).
