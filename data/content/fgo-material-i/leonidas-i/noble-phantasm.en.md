Thermopylae Enomotia{{n1}}.
The summoning of the army Sparta, 300 man strong, who had fought together in the Battle of Thermopylae.
It demonstrates fierce power in defense rather than offense.
It is a instantenous reproduction of a historical deed. Due to that, it can be invoked even after the enemy has performed their attack.
It protects not only Leonidas, but the master as well.
Normally it is a counterattack Noble Phantasm, with each of the 300 possessing C~E rank status in END. The more Spartans manages to endure enemy attacks, the higher the increase of the counter attackâ€™s damage next turn.
