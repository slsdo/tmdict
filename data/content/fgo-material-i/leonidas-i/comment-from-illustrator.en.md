In his design, at first I wasn’t made aware that Leonidas is the lead of a certain movie. I was quite troubled, being overly conscious of intending to keep the design free of preconception. But in the end, Leonidas’ figure becomes as he is now, shown quite simply and easily recognized. Later, due to the lack of materials other than some simple speech style, I ended up designing him with a bit of a stalwart image. But then I played around with some service here and there and I’m immensely surprised that he became such a pleasant character than exceeds even my imagination. Still, I am relieved that everybody accept the gap between the tough design and the pleasant character. Now that I think about it, I’m really glad I created a differing expression for when he wears his helmet. I like drawing muscles, so he is a character I would love to draw again even in a different figure. (Shimaudon)
