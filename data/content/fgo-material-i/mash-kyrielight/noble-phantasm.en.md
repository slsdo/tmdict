Something named by Olga Marie Animusphere. The Noble Phantasm Mash deploys according to her instincts without the True Name of the Heroic Spirit who possessed her being known to her as she is now. It expands a strong protective barrier in front of her. It appears being crowned with the name of Chaldeas is from the wish that lies in Mash’s foundation, the wish called “to see the future of humanity.”
