  For the Protagonist, she uses “Senpai” and “Master” for different purposes, such as on the occasions where her Master calls her name and on the occasions where she continues on as a Servant. Regarding the matter with Roman, although she calls him “Doctor”, if Roman’s silly lines are too terrible, she calls him “Dr. Roman” and gives him a harsh assessment.</td></tr>

### Personality

Diplomatic, timid, and active. A girl poor at expressing emotions. Mash’s life experience is scarce, but she has a large amount of knowledge. Since she is taciturn, and moreover, has an efficient and cool manner and speech, she happens to closely fit into the adjective of ‘as if she is like a doll’~ or some such. Still, Mash herself is very much an ordinary girl, someone who is intellectually brimming with curiosity and active, simply a little taciturn, and whose theatrical elocution is just amusing.

Outgoing: She reliably greets others by herself. She conversates with companions and seeks their opinions.
Timid: A timid person who appears to be pulling herself together. It is always scary for her to fight. But she still does her best.
An Active Dynamic: She appears to be mild-mannered before coming forth to someone without hesitation. The cause of her being seen as an eccentric young girl is from this characteristic.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

After becoming a Servant, Mash idolizes the Protagonist as her Senpai, and she will become the Protagonist’s power, she will be useful for the Protagonist, and she will do her best. It seems that said person is more than happy with that above anything else. Mash does not use “!” very much, firmly saying instead “Master, instructions!” or “Senpai, please!” before combat, and those are the expressions of her request & reliance called “Please help the weak me!” Her outward appearance tends to be seen as a cool battle heroine, but her core part is the exact opposite. No matter how much she gets used to doing battle, it is scary for her, and she wants to be calm during combat as much as she can if possible. Mash’s components are summarized into qualities such as “a serious and obedient honours student”, “a Kouhai who treats her Senpai with respect. It is not known whether or not that is her way of seeing love though”, and “(misunderstood as) just a slightly eccentric young girl”.

### Dialogue Examples

“… Um. It is neither morning nor night, so please wake up, Senpai.”
“The reason… huh? Ritsuka-san… he is the most humane among the humans I have encountered up to now. I really do not sense any threat from him. It is because of that that there is no reason for me to be hostile to him at all.”
“Senpai, it was a disaster immediately after she took up her new post. Nevertheless, there is room for sympathy even for the Director’s irritability.”
“With all due respect, Ritsuka-senpai is too ignorant regarding Chaldea.”
“It is impossible to communicate our intentions by means of language. I judge it to be a hostile creature. Master, instructions. With both Senpai and I, we will get over this situation!”

### Character Image

Someone with Grade A Master Aptitude who Chaldea prepared. A Designer Child conceived through artificial insemination and reared inside Chaldea. Not a homunculus but a fully-fledged human being. However, Mash’s life span is short due to the matter where her Magical Circuits and Master Aptitude were prioritized. It is said that the life activity of a Designer Child ceases when they are about 30 years old, but Mash’s is even shorter than that. This is because the life span of her body was further shortened due to the fusion experiment she underwent with a Servant. Mash has been diagnosed with an activity limit of 18 years.

Mash was previously possessed by the second of the three Heroic Spirits summoned by Chaldea, who were all summoned by the Heroic Spirit Summoning System – FATE. Although the second Heroic Spirit possessed Mash, he showed his discomfort for this experiment that violates humanitarianism, refusing to cooperate with Chaldea. Thereafter, he had been observing with silence inside of Mash, but his heart was touched with what he saw just before Mash died, so he fused with her for the sake of keeping her alive. Mash herself has not been informed of what Heroic Spirit was inside of her. This is because the previous director had been keeping it a secret for he was afraid that the testee… that Mash would become arrogant and be alienated.

Until the start of the Story’s Prologue, Mash had been spending time in an isolation room within Chaldea. The isolation room is a small room with one side of the walls being composed out of glass so that it can be monitored from the outside. She kept on living in that room for 14 years, and since she was 15 years old, it had reached the point where it was not a problem for her to move within Chaldea if circumstances allowed it, such as receiving training as a member of A-Team, a team where specially selected Masters were assembled into. She came across the Protagonist, who turned up at Chaldea, on the morning of the day she became 16 years old. After Chaldea was devastated and she became a Demi-Servant, Mash exerts herself as the Protagonist’s Servant.

Mash’s mental structure has been viewed as being similar to a chick that had just been born. Pure, and without being aware of the things to be suspicious of, she merely acts for the sake of the things she believes in. (Her human-like mental structure and its contradictions continue to grow throughout her journey.)

### Role within the Game

Mash plays an active role as the Protagonist’s navigator in both the Main Story and in Special Events. The main heroine, the main shield. Cool and taciturn, and yet her true nature is one where she acts as a devoted and earnest Kouhai character. Although she has knowledge concerning magecraft, history and Heroic Spirits, her common sense is rather lacking. The main Servant who has a formal contract with the Protagonist. Other than that contract, the contracts formed with the other Servants are simply no more than sub-contracts where “they are lending their power because of the Human Order Incineration.”

### Connections with Characters

#### Lev Lainur

Although it was limited to a period of two years, as far as Mash is concerned, Lev is her former teacher in the Magecraft Department. It appears that even Lev has also been exceptionally connecting with Mash as “a single person”. For that reason, Mash is not able to possess the awareness that Lev is a bad person.

#### Dr. Roman

A figure who is at the top of Chaldea’s Medical Department, and as of now, is acting on the director’s behalf. Since Mash is very much obliged to him, she relies on as well as trusts Roman. To Mash, Roman is a figure interpreted as both the kind father and the kind older brother at the house next door.
