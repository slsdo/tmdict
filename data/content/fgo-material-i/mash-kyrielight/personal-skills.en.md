### The Now Brittle Wall of Snowflakes

A defense buff that covers the entire party. The user’s force of will is converted into physical defense.

Because Mash still misunderstands the way on how to use her Noble Phantasm, its true value is not able to be shown.

### The Occasionally Hazy Wall of Chalk

A defense Skill that allows one to arbitrarily put an invincibility effect on someone among their party. Their NP also goes up a little.

In accordance with its name of how it is called ‘Occasionally Hazy’, the target temporarily shifts out of the time axis in order to avoid attacks. If the rank was higher, the target could even phase through attacks, among other things, from a higher dimension. That principle is close to a certain defensive Noble Phantasm that is used to target its own user.

### Shield of a Rousing, Severing Resolution

A Skill that temporarily raises one’s own defensive power and draws in an opponent’s attacks. It is bestowed only to someone who musters their courage and defends the backs of those who egress before anyone else.

This seems to be a Skill not of the Noble Phantasm itself, but rather of the form the mentality of Mash herself took.
