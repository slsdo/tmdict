Mash is a character that had been only created since the time of stay night. The expectation was that she was designed to be a person wielding a massive shield in a SF (Science Fiction)-like bodysuit, but I added some armour parts and volume to her chest for FateGO, and it resulted in her current design. There was particularly no setting for her wearing glasses in her civilian clothes, but given that it seemed to match well with her, I tried to put it on her. I am thinking, ‘I wonder if it turned out to be a nice accent in her design as a form of variety from the times when she is a Servant.’ (Takeuchi Takashi)
