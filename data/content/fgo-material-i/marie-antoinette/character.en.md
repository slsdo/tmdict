### Personality

An image (idol) by birth. Soothing the people with a smile, gaining adoration with a gaze. Marie was born to be loved, and this is not a theory to her, but her actually feeling this as an instinct. Accepting the fact that she is an image, and finding joy in that, she set her heart on conducting herself as what was desired of her. That mentality is already not far off from some kind of goddess.

Marie never hates the people. As she was born for the sake of being loved, she therefore loves the people. If the people deem her to be unnecessary, and even if they shout at her, capture her, and kill her, she will show a smile to them even at the moment of her death. However, because her mentality as a Servant is fundamentally being stopped at “the moment she married Louis XVI, visited France as its queen, and was blessed and loved by the many citizens”, she does not easily display her aspect as a tragic queen. (It is not the case that she has no memories after that moment. Nevertheless, the stage of her mentality and character is simply at “that time”.)

Upfront. Spontaneous. Marie will speak of anything she thought of. She will say the likeable things are what she likes, and the not so likeable things are what she dislikes.

Marie likes baths. Awfully liking to keep herself clean is an influence from her mother, Maria Theresa. Because “the light perfumes with a scent similar to flowers and herbs are pleasant”, the perfumes she uses are not that strong.

Marie is a spendthrift. She completely wastes money on one thing or another as she pleases without even understanding herself about this trait.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As the bond with the Protagonist (Master) deepens, it will reach the point where Marie will display the aspect of her tragic side. It is very evident that she is “the very idol that continues to scatter love, yet whose scars remained imprinted on both her body and mind.” And yet, she still smiles beautifully. Never, will Marie desire for the erasure of the tragedy.

### Dialogue Examples

“Everyone, I love you all————Thank you, Vive la France!”
“For everyone who’s fond of me, please, I wish you all to be blessed with a wonderful grace!”
“Hey, let’s dance, let’s sing! This will be a delightful ball!”
“Boisterously like a flower, like the sunshine.”
“Brioche is delicious. Do you like it? What’s that?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A French Queen of the 18th Century whose genealogy corresponds to the House of Habsburg. The consort of Louis XVI. An ephemeral lady. Born between Maria Theresa, a descendant of the House of Habsburg – the great German royal house – and Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, a person originating from the House of Lorraine as its Duke, Marie was born and raised as an existence that symbolizes “the rule of the nobility” of the European world, but in the violent torrents of human history where the absoluteness of the Royal Authority was continually being lost, she lost her life before the changes of the world.

Loved as a symbol of the Royal Authority, being blessed while living————
Detested as a symbol of the Royal Authority, shown contempt as she ended up dead.
The protruding eyes of the nobility, political marriage, living the royal court life, and then, revolution and execution. It is possible to say that way of life and manner of death of Marie’s became the embodiment of the Royal Authority as an evident “idol”.

Although she became a target of hatred by many people before and after the Revolution, Marie’s impaired reputation has been restored in modern France; when famines came about, she would cut royal court expenses to make donations, she would personally request the nobles to provide support to the people, and so forth – Thus, it is being confirmed that she was a woman who thought of the citizens.

There was a tragedy. But————
Marie will never wish on the Holy Grail for the erasure of the tragedy. She will only carry out her own role. In other words:
Radiance to the sky. Blessings to the earth.
————Happiness, to the people.

### General Armaments

Her singing voice. While it is a voice that charms people, it is also a declaration of the exercise of power by the Royal Authority. For Marie, who materializes as a symbolic existence, she can conduct magic damage towards the antagonists of the Royal Authority with just a singing voice.

### Concept

Marie’s concept is an “Idol Queen”. An idol who flew down to France of the 18th Century. Or, a glass angel (as a symbol and embodiment of a pure and fleeting thing, and not as a religious motif).

### Connections with Characters

#### Amadeus

Around the time when Marie was seven years old, on the occasion of a six-year-old genius boy, who was invited to the palace of Vienna as a performing musician, falling down, she had extended her gentle hand to him. As a matter of fact, this genius boy would be later known as Amadeus Mozart, and he proposed marriage to the beautiful Marie (who at that time had the name Maria). The answer at that time was…

Even now where he became a Heroic Spirit, Marie recognizes that she “likes” the sincere and fun Amadeus. That is to say, this “like” has not changed in any way or form from when she felt it around that very youthful time.

#### Charles-Henri Sanson

The executioner who hoisted the guillotine for Marie. During her lifetime, Sanson was also the companion who raised his voice to her during her final moments. Just before her execution, it is said that Marie expressed her words of apology regarding the incident of her stepping on Sanson’s shoes.

#### Chevalier d’Éon

Marie completely recognizes d’Éon as a “woman”. Furthermore, Marie deeply respects d’Éon as a person who devoted herself to secret missions and diplomacies while she was a woman. Marie had given a dress to d’Éon during their lifetimes. For Marie, she thinks about going out with d’Éon as a fellow friend and not as a master to a servant, but…
