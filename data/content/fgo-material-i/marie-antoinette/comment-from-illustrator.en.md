Given that she is an Idol Queen, should her outfit also be stylish? That is the direction it became. Since a portrait of Marie Antoinette remains where her hair was in its best days and she wore a big hat, her hair has a substantial volume even though her head may appear in this way, but it’s HUGE whenever I look over it again, isn’t it?! Although I put in a motif of a white lily on some parts of her, the tips of her twintails are especially my favourite. (Ginka)
