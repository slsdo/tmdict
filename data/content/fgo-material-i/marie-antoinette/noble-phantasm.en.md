Guillotine Breaker.
A Noble Phantasm that symbolized the glory of the French Royal Authority. An Anti-Army Noble Phantasm. Its exterior appearance is that of a beautiful horse composed of glass, which contains the French Royal Family’s coat of arms (the crest of the lily flower).

Marie can call forth this horse by releasing its True Name, the horse running through the battlefield while gently scattering twinkling particles of sparkling light, causing damage to the antagonists of the Royal Authority. Simultaneously, it cancels out bad status effects on allies and recovers their health and magical energy.

(The Noble Phantasm’s former name was Fleur-de-Lis.)

Crystal Palace.
A Barrier Noble Phantasm. An enormous palace that boasts of elegance and represents the influence of the French Royal Family of successive generations makes its appearance, temporarily ranking up Marie’s and her allies’ parameters. Even though the Royal Authority had died out, the people and the France that she loved will remain for eternity – that is called Marie’s faith, which calls forth the Crystal Palace as a symbol of growth and a new age.

Having the same name as the “Crystal Palace” constructed for London’s Great Exhibition in neighbouring England is in no way an irony and the like, but rather, it seems to be something that shows how wide Marie’s love is. “Ooh, I love it! The Crystal Palace of London’s World Fair. So, it served as a reference during the occasion of my Noble Phantasm being arranged, but I wonder if something like this could be an issue…?”
