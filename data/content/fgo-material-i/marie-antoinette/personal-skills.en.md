### Godâ€™s Grace: B

Born to be a beautiful monarch, she is provided with the finest beauty and body.

### Beautiful Voice of Captivation: C

A natural constitution of having a beautiful voice. It works as a magical charm effect towards males, but evasion is possible with a Magical Resistance Skill. Even without Magical Resistance, one can abate it to some extent so long as he maintains a will to resist.

### Beautiful Princess: A

A charismatic nature not for leadership, but to bring and attract to one the people in their surroundings.

For Marie, who possesses this Skill at Rank A, she can pull a knightly character to defend her just by simply existing as she is.
