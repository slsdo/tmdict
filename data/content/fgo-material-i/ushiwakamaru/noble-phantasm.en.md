Shana-Ou Ryuuritan.
The embodiment of Ushiwakamaru’s various legends, which were created from right after she became Minamoto no Yoshitsune to the moment she perished in Oshu. This Noble Phantasm comprises five secret techniques.{{n1}}

〇 Jizaiten’s Eye – Seeing with the Six Secret Teachings / Anti-Army Secret Technique

Forcibly relocates everyone that are on the field. It changes battle conditions in that it creates an overwhelming advantage for each ally’s position and an overwhelming disadvantage for the enemy camp.

〇 Usumidori – Short Steps with the Heavenly Blade / Anti-Unit Secret Technique

A brilliant slash with Usumidori. This single attack, delivered after a Shukuchi movement that was executed according to the footwork of a tengu, is difficult to evade.

〇 Benkei – Steadfast Position / Anti-Army Secret Technique

Recreates an imitation of Musashibou Benkei’s body alone. The more faith she has in Benkei, the stronger the body becomes, resulting in a sturdy shield. It can defend against Anti-Army Noble Phantasms up to Rank B.

**〇 Dan-no-ura – Eight Boat Leap / Anti-Army Secret Technique**

The materialization of Ushiwakamaru’s feat of leaping over eight boats that she displayed at Dan-no-ura. No matter how difficult the terrain is in getting a foothold, if there is even the slightest place where she can place her foot on, it is possible for her to move through the terrain by jumping. Also, this technique further enhances her jumping power.

〇 Hoemaru – Spider Killer / Anti-Army Secret Technique

Demonstrates Usumidori’s true “power”. It repels “demons” in the surrounding area and inflicts damage according to its sonic attack.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Ushiwakamaru actually has a sixth secret technique that is considered a part of King Mahavairocana’s Wandering Tales despite not being listed. As seen in Onigashima, it’s called Kikenjou – Icicle Cutting, a technique which allows her to cut through an incoming attack, mainly projectile attacks. This technique is based on Yoshitsune’s feat of cutting down arrows that were fired at him, as if he was cutting through icicles.
  Others – Jizaiten is the Japanese name for Maheśvara, one of Shiva’s epithets meaning ‘Great Lord‘.
