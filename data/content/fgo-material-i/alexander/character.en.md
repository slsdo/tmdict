### Personality

A bright cheerfulness. A rosy-cheeked pretty boy filled with possibilities.
His behavior is basically that of a child, he amiably comes into contact with anyone without exception, but the important point is his calmness. He’s not reluctant to choose cruel methods if the situation requires it.
He fundamentally can’t tell lies, he thinks there’s no need to lie.
While coming to grips with the world by feeling with his five senses, he continues to learn a lot.

He will someday notice that the end of human history means nothing but the closing of his own possibilities. And unhappily, he’ll oppose it.
The manifestation of a spirit giving its first steps will be of help to the Master without doubt.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

His loyalty towards the Master isn’t that high, but he delivers trust as a friend.
Because he’s at the age of learning, the easier relationships to build are 『friend · schoolmate』.
Since in the end the young Alexander is at the present world, his insistence on the wish to become famous as 『the Conqueror King Iskandar』 is weak. The abundant large figure (not sure if by 大柄 they mean this) he’ll somebody grow into and experience, what he holds in his chest, he can’t feel it yet as 『something of his』.

### Dialogue Examples

「I’m Alexander. Alexandros III is fine too. Other names as well, of course.」
「I’m supposed to be experienced but this sensation is new ―― It’s strange.」
「Go! Bucephalus! My trampling starts from here!」
「It was as teacher Aristotle said」
「You, do you have something you like? I have a lot.」

### Historical Image · Character Image

The young prince of the Macedonia kingdom in the 4th century BC.
An unmatched pretty boy, the Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first genius among many wise men to discover his talent, and, an innocent child that loves the Greek epic 『Iliad』 from the bottom of his heart.
Sometimes learning philosophy and political science, sometimes excitedly absorbed in reading mythology, sometimes accumulating training as a soldier, while letting many talents blossom, he was allowed all the possibilities ―――

For whatever reason, the Conqueror King Iskandar is summoned in the shape of the young Alexander boy.
Not only his appearance but his spirit is also that of a young boy. It’s not like his memories have been ever lost, but regarding the memories after his youth period they’re a bit in a『feeling weak』 state.

### General Armaments

A one-handed sword called spata for melee attacks.
When fighting, usually, he rides the large black horse that is his Noble Phantasm. A prince on a black horse.
(His loved horse Bucephalus is also a fully-fledged Heroic Spirit).
