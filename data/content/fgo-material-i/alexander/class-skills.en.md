### Magic Resistance: D

Can cancel Single-Action spells.

### Riding: A+

Can freely control all beasts and vehicles except the Dragon Kind.

### Divinity E

Attitude as a Divine Spirit. Although Alexander is said to be the son of the supreme god Zeus, he doesnâ€™t possess such a high Divinity as a young boy. He will recognize himself as a son of Zeus as he grows up to become a Great King so that his Divinity becomes higher.
