### Rosy-cheeked Pretty Boy: B

Nature as a pretty boy that charms people.
It works like a magecraft-like effect of fascination regardless of gender, but it can be avoided with the Magic Resistance skill. Even without having Magic Resistance, the effect can be reduced to a certain extent if one has the will to resist.

### Charisma: C

The extremely high Charisma that he displays as the Great King wasn’t completely obtained when he was still a young boy, but that portion is already shining as the 『Rosy-cheeked Pretty Boy』 skill.
That said, it already surpasses the ability of an ordinary king.

### Signs of a Supreme King: A

A portion of the spirituality that will be held as the Conqueror King Iskandar.
By invigorating the spirit, plus corrections are added to all sorts of checks.
