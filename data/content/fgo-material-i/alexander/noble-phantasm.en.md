Bucephalus.
The loved horse of Alexander is a legendarily famous horse, and a terrible man-eater horse as well.
A rampant horse that doesn’t let anyone besides him ride her, and which was said that the one that could ride her would obtain the world. Bucephalus has already become an existence as partly a Heroic Spirit. In other words, the Heroic Spirit is a Noble Phantasm, the Noble Phantasm is a Heroic Spirit.
The black horse that appears when Alexander of later years ―― Iskandar uses his Noble Phantasm 『Army of the King』 is this Bucephalus, and the Servant Alexander boy makes use of this horse in battle by riding her.
Upon release of the True Name, a violent charge towards the enemy formation is performed while riding her, trampling while scattering the lightning of the father Zeus. The scale of destruction is smaller than 『Distant Trampling Conquest』, but the mobility is superior.

Zeus Thunder. The self-recognition of the young Alexander as the child of a god that has become a Noble Phantasm.
The lightning of Zeus strengthens his body when used, and increases the rank of the Divinity skill too. In exchange, the Rosy-cheeked Pretty Boy skill gets a rank down. In other words, if he uses it too much――?
(Not used in 『FateGO』).
