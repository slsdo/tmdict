I had to look twice the first moment I got the designation. I was worried about how much of Iskandar’s looks I left (although it’s the opposite), but I already went serious and drew him. I wanted to make Bucephalus huge in contrast to a young boy of delicate looks, but since the main point, Alexander, would get smaller in the screen, she’s still growing… that’s the little excuse in my brain for making her smaller.
