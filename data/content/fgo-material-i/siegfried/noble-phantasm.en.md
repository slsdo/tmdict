Balmung.
A cursed sacred sword that achieved the feat of dragon slaying. Being that it even also has the attribute of the Demonic Sword “Gram”, its origin, its attribute will change between sacred sword and demonic sword depending on who wields it. The blue jewel of its hilt is preserving/storing magical energy from the Age of Gods (True Ether), and when this is unleashed, it emits the appearance of a sword with a twilight colour. The sword inflicts additional damage on those who draw the blood of a Dragon Kind.

Armor of Fafnir.
The Noble Phantasm that embodied the anecdote of Siegfried bathing in the blood of an evil dragon. Nullifies physical attacks as well as spells equivalent to B-rank. In addition, attacks of A-rank and above register as damage after defensive values in proportion to B-rank are deducted from the attack’s value. In the case where a Noble Phantasm from a proper hero is employed against him, it gains defensive values equivalent to B+. However, his back, which has not been bathed in the dragon’s blood, does not gain the defensive values, and he is also not able to conceal it.
