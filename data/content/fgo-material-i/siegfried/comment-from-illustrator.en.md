Originally, besides the amazing number of lines I had to draw, I wanted to make him very flashy if it’s the case that he’ll go with the trend and evolve! And the staff had to race to implement him in the end when his appeal didn’t fit into the phone screen as I more than doubled their troubles too with the absurd workload! I’m really sorry.

After I came up with the rest of his evolutions, if I leaned him forward a little in order to choose a way to balance his weight, it’s miraculously matching with more of his established character, all for the appearance of making him awfully apologetic… Even though he’s a great hero, I’m sorry.
