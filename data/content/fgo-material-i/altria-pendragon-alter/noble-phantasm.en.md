Excalibur Morgan.
The sword of black auroras. Since Excalibur is an amplifier that converts the owner’s magical energy, even the light of the blackened Saber’s Sacred Sword has similarly become a black colour too. Not only the light’s colour, but the sword’s outward appearance is also somewhat different, and that to the end is another aspect of the same Excalibur. Just like how Vivian and Morgan can coexist as the Fairy of the Lake, it appears that this Sacred Sword has the attributes of both good and evil as well. The black-stained magical energy is the primeval cursed energy that lurks in the British Islands, and it is the bewitching princess Morgan, Artoria’s older sister, who inherited that from King Uther. The name of this Sacred Sword was altered because it may not come to light that it is the only connection Artoria has with Morgan, for they could not understand each other up to the very end.
