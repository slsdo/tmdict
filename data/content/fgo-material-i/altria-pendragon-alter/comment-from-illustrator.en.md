I was very grateful for this character to come into existence, even though she has few transformation differences. Alterâ€™s visor is one of those differences too. It is a small change, but it has a serious significance behind it. For her third stage dress, I am using a clothing article that was designed for the use of VOLKS dolls. In addition, I decided on doing things such as having this dress change into a miniskirt in her Final Ascension illustration. (Takeuchi Takashi)
