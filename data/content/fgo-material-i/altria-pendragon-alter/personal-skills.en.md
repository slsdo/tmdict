### Magical Burst: A

Her colossal magical energy covers her body, resulting in a dense fog around her even if she is not being conscious in using her magical energy. Due to the after-effects of her blackened armour and magical energy, her defensive power has been remarkably improved. Of course, a large amount of magical energy is being constantly consumed for this as well, so as a result, her appetite has been increased to a level greater than when she was her normal self since that is necessary to maintain this ability.

### Intuition: B

The ability to always “feel” the most suitable development for oneself during combat.
Because she is constantly suppressing her ferocity consciously, her intuitions have grown dull. Speaking of this conversely, it might not be obvious that with Artoria’s state in this condition, she is rather more likely to take action as a person who became distant from being a hero.

### Charisma: E

The natural talent to command an army. Increases the abilities of allies during group battles.
One’s leadership ability increases, but the morale of troops decreases to the utmost.
