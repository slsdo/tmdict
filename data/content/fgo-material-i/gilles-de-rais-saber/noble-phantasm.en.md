Saint War Order.
A Noble Phantasm that reproduces the moments when he was fighting under the flag of the saint Jeanne, in other words, the moment at which he was shining the most.
Together with a status up effect similar to Mad Enhancement, performs attacks automatically until the targeted enemy has been completely silenced. A bonus is added to the damage from attacks.

Prelati’s Spellbook.
A grimoire wrapped with human skin. Allows to summon and exploit a kind of water demons from the deep sea.
This book itself has a function as a mana furnace, and allows to perform spells on the level of High Thaumaturgy/Greater Rituals independently of the caster’s mana.
…… But, the Gilles de Rais that is a Saber doesn’t use this Noble Phantasm even if he brings it with him.
Should he use it, he will automatically change his class to Caster, and 『Rally Upon the Sacred Banner and Roar』 will be sealed. (Not used in 『FateGO』).
