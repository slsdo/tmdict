Since it was established that he’d have the grimoire, the semi-fallen estate of the third stage was the initial design. There, I received a suggestion from Takeuchi-san, a beautiful Gilles (1 – 2 stage) was born, and a story nature was given to the Ascensions. The fall to darkness of the heroine is erotic and nice.
