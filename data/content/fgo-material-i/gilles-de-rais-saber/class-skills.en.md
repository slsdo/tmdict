### Magic Resistance: B

Invalidates magecraft with an activation chant below three verses.
Even being wounded by High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals is difficult.

### Riding: B

Talent for riding. Can ride normal vehicles with above average skill, but can’t ride beasts on the level of Demonic Beast or Divine Beast.

### Mad Enhancement: EX

Since it’s a very special summoning, and the name of Gilles de Rais is much more famously known as ――― Bluebeard, even Saber will be granted the Mad Enhancement skill.
