I’ve thought of Elizabeth’s third ascension with her last concert sort of costume, and I had intended to make it kinda gaudy and somewhat in a bad taste; I’m pretty satisfied in regards with the result, but when the game was implemented and you apparently couldn’t choose your battle sprite after ascension, I got surprised and was like oh shiiiiiiit shiiiiiiiiiiiit. Thank god we now get to choose which sprite we use. Thank you very much, development team. (Wada Arco)
