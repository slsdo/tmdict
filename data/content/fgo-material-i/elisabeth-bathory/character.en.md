### Personality

Sweets type Servant, and a self-proclaimed idol.

Due to Servants being summoned with the figure of their heyday, Liz is summoned as she was most beautiful as far as she is concerned, with the body of 14 years old before her marriage and as a Heroic Spirit possessing humanity.
What exist within are no other than the mind towards love, love that she dreamt of up to her time of marriage; her imprisonment as the devil; and the memory of nightmare on the verge of her death. Hence, the madness has made her confuse between her way of being as a noble’s daughter and her affliction of nightmare.

High-classed, domineering, atrocious, ruthless. All the inhumane qualities as her legend had shown themselves. ...And yet, she herself is a maiden who dream of love. Her timid nature becoming her own ruin; looking at only the result, she helped her comrades,overlooked her enemies, and fell in love with her Master. She ends up showing the barest of line of humane goodness; basically “Well, can’t really say she is not a Heroic Spirit.”

She herself dislikes being described as “You’re actually a good person, aren’t you?”

To add, due to her not showing interest to anything but her own beauty, in actuality she is extremely estranged from knowledge and experience that are sexual in nature.

When summoned again as a Servant, she becomes aware of the job known as “Japanese idol”, and from that day after she proclaims herself as the Idol Servant, completely and seriously devoting her body and soul in playing the part of an idol.

As a result, she ends up looking like a girl who didn’t know any better. For Liz, the existence known as idol is the first that had ever gave her such a “girlish happiness”. She has absolute confidence in her singing voice, but her music sense way too distant from the norm; for normal people her singing ends up to be just a form of torture.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As a Servant, she is friendly and acknowledges the magus that is her Master as someone who understands the uniqueness of summoning a super idol like her. She would diligently lend him/her a hand.
She has a strong responsibility towards the job she has been assigned to, and would mostly cooperate with the Master’s objective.
While that attitude of hers stems from how she was born as a noble who engages in ruling and controlling the masses in a serious manner, as far as Liz is concerned “rule” and “control” are, in other words, torture.
Her thoughts come from how hurting humans for her is the usual state of things no different from breathing, and she is utterly cruel and merciless towards the enemies. Because she completely does not understand the pain of others, there perhaps exist within her lineage circumstances the disposition of recognizing for the first time that “this living being is a human” upon seeing others in pain.

### Dialogue Examples

“You held your head too high; kneel immediately and look up to my beauty! This is the entrance of the Super Idol born in human history, Elizabeth Bathory!”
“Idol! Ahh, such a lovely sound it makes! She is wanted for naught but to be adorable, and it is her job to be indulged on!”
“Eh.. if you are going to apologize that much, I’d end up wanting to apologize too… I mean, I was in the fault too…. Actually, there isn’t a single good thing going on with me...”
“B-But, I’m really, really repenting here, you know!? I know I would probably never be forgiven, but I still want to help!”
“So, don’t be scared of me…!! Because I’m really going to sing my best! I’m not going to squeeze out blood or anything like that anymore!!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A real historical figure. Born 1560, died 1614. Born in the House of Bathory, a noble house of Hungary who had made the dragon’s fang their crest. She is related with the one who had become the model of the vampire Dracula, Vlad III of Wallachia. She herself is the model for Joseph Sheridan le Fanu’s mystery novel “Vampire Carmilla”.

The House of Bathory was a noble family possessing influence in most of Eastern Europe range. On top of that, she also drew lineage from the House of Hapsburg; truly a lineage that can be said to be a thoroughbred noble.

However, House of Bathory’s consanguineous marriage and luxuriant environment makes many of them to be mad and atrocious. Elizabeth is not an exception. Her name had become known throughout the world for her heinous acts.

For her, preserving her beauty is a must; in Csejte Castle, in her personal territory of what is now known as modern Slovakia, she had slaughtered no less than 600 women. All of them then had their blood squeezed out, and she had made a bath out of it… having a taste for repulsive bloodbath.

### Role within the Game

Pushing aside the other Servants, she managed to appear 3 times in the main story during the first, second, and fifth chapter. And even in the Halloween Event “Adventure of the Castle of Singing Pumpkin”, albeit as a different Servant, she managed to put herself as well as a Caster Class. In the story, she appearing is pretty much a running gag already.

She refers only to the Protagonist with a special nickname, just like how she does so to the protagonist of “Fate/EXTRA CCC”, as “puppy/kitten”.

### Role in Past Works

In Fate/EXTRA CCC, she appeared with Tohsaka Rin as her Master…. although, she kept on being defeated by the protagonist, reappearing again and again as she changes Master and Class, and at last, even ends up making a contract temporarily as the protagonist’s Servant. Even in FGO, she goes all out in showing that guts of hers to keep on appearing like that.

### Connections with Characters

#### Nero

A rival whom she sympathize with in a shared mind and opinion as an idol. Basically, an idol friend.

#### Vlad III

The Fate/Apocrypha version. Actually a relative of her, and they share a connection as fellow vampire as well.{{n1}}
She is emotionally attached{{n2}} to this version of Vlad III, whose exudes dignity as a noble, quite immensely.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} I have no idea if this is true or not, but apparently:

  Vlad the Impaler (Dracula) was the Prince of Wallachia in 1448, 1456-1462, and in 1476. Dracula married first a Transylvanian noblewoman. His second wife was Ilona Szilagy, daughter of Mihaly Szilagy (Dracula’s cousin), and a relative of Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. Dracula entertained a Polish nobleman (Benedict de Boithor) an ambassadors of Matthias Corvinus in his own home. Dracula was the great-uncle of Elizabeth Bathory (1560-1614).

  Could be something like an unconfirmed legend and they make it that it is so in nasuverse.
