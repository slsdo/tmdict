Báthory Erzsébet.
A Noble Phantasm that summons the castle that Elizabeth had reigned in during her life, the stage that makes herself most prominent.
Its other name is the Prison Castle Csejte. The very demonic castle where she had once tortured and killed countless numbers of white maidens.
Above the stage, the castle that had been modified into a gigantic amplifier as it is, she performs a devastatingly off-key song. The descent of the stage of hell.
Its key point is the hell of super sonic breath. Whether its harshness is due to the song or the shock is left to your conclusion.
