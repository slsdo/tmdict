Even now, I still remember the lolshock{{n1}} I got upon receiving the unexpected otaku setting. To match it up, I make most of his expression to have a comical feeling. However, Iâ€™m glad I at least had drawn just his angry face with a just a little bit of blood thirst. His disgusting blushing face is my favorite. Dufufu.
If I got the chance, I would love to draw and show the Blackbeard full of dignity. (Bsuke)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Shougeki is shock/impact/crash, but the shou apparently uses the kanji for laugh instead here, aka LOL
vote yes for cool blackbeard
