Queen Anne’s Revenge.
The ship that Blackbeard once had actually boarded on. Originally it was a French ship, but due to Blackbeard plundering it, it had become the pirate ship known as Queen Anne’s Revenge.
After beginning by launcing an artillery attacks using its 40 canons, Blackbeard would then put a savage assault to the enemy ship together with his underlings, who have turned into low ranked spirits (they are nameless and without any understanding of themselves other than as “Blackbeard’s underlings”).
The monster ship specialized in plundering.
Such an overwhelming amount of violence seems to be quite notable among the numerous Noble Phantasms.
In addition, as long as this ship is on the sea, it manifests as a “continously deployed Noble Phantasm”. It is capable of advancing to either the land or the sky, but in those cases it will consume a large quantity of magic energy.

And lastly, this ship possesses the ability to rapidly increase its damage should there be Servants other than Blackbeard embarking on it.
