### Magical Resistance: C

Nullifies spells that were done with a chant in two steps or below. Cannot defend against large-scale magecraft such as Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.
Because Nero herself has no resistance to magic at all, she boasts a low Magical Resistance unbecoming for the Saber Class.

### Riding: B

The ability for riding. One can manage most vehicles and beasts with above-average skill, but they cannot manage beasts of the Magical Beast and Sacred Beast rank.
Neroâ€™s field of expertise is with chariots, but given that her butt gets sore when riding them, said person is avoiding them when she can.
