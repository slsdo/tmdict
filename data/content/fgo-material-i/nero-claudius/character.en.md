### Personality

A self-proclaimed/cross-dressing young swordswoman, her body dressed in a red ball gown (dress). Nero boasts an overwhelmingly well-balanced fighting strength, led by her preeminent sword skills. She calls herself an almighty genius, introduces herself as Emperor, and almost all things are completely made to be realized by her forcibly. Innocence still remains in that appearance, but she refers to herself with “I”{{n1}} and the like; selfish and egotistical, constantly looking down on others, and having a tendency to rush ahead recklessly, she is fully loaded with factors that a detestable character would be composed of if those traits come about normally.
However, Nero is an extraordinarily lovely character, having a cheerful openheartedness, a broadness that does not care much about trivial matters, and a simple-mindedness like that of a child’s. She has a passionate nature, and although she is generous with love relationships because of matters during her lifetime among other things, she has a side to her where she would pout if those relationships were extravagant to her.
Still, Nero does not doubt of herself as a genius, calling herself an artist too, and she possesses a unique sense of beauty. Her unconditional justice is “to be beautiful.” She likes pretty boys and handsome elders. She likes beautiful girls even more. She loves anything so long as it is beautiful, no matter what it is. A “tyrant” who, while extolling herself as the supreme art, also extols the lives of every person as beautiful. Above all else, a dazzling girl who is also more self-centered than anyone; it feels as if she symbolizes a life that spectacularly fell.

There are hardly any Masters who will summon her out of that history. It is because her True Name was, at a time, heinous in the view of a certain religion, and also, the end of her life was even a miserable one.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

What Nero ascertains is not the societal good and evil, but the way human beauty ought to be, which becomes her standard. There is never a time where she will love something that is disconnected from that definition, and even if it is the command of a Master who exchanged a contract with her as a Servant, she will absolutely not obey them if she felt that they are ugly. There is no mage who wishes to summon a Servant who would decide to evaluate their standards by such “beauty”, and in the Holy Grail War of the Moon as well, Servants are summoned not because of a Master, but by going down into the selection grounds for their own intentions.
Although she is a lonely person, Nero is furthermore proud in that she would never sell herself cheaply, only feeling like contracting with a partner who she deemed to be a genius on the same level as herself. For that reason, if there is a partner she once approved of as her Master, she would not point out or even criticize their inexperience, and from the bottom of her heart, she would not look down on them as well. It seems one can gain her straightforward favour in the event that they are able to answer her expectations, that they are both rejoicing together, and that the trust in each other are being strengthened.

### Dialogue Examples

“Silence! My sword is the Original Passion (Flame), and the sound of sword fights is the same as the stars going around the skies (heavens). Listen to it in ecstasy. And then, give praise to it, and moreover, rejoice in it. I am the supreme and ultimate instrument————the Heroic Spirit of the Sword, your Servant!”
“Do bear in mind. The things I hate… are frugality, ruin, and rebellions!”
“I do not like those who are kind. I like those who are kind to me!”
“Behold my talent! Hear the thunderous applause! Here is the honour of the Imperium. Like a flower blossoming in full glory… Open! Golden Theater!!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A real person. His real name is Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus. He is the Fifth Emperor of Imperial Rome. That life of his was coloured with schemes and poison, and in Rome during the 50~60 AD period, he oppressed all religious influences and the Senate. In the Roman period, because of his stance towards the Senate, and because of his oppression towards Christians thereafter, it caused him to be called a tyrant. It is being said that the “Revelation of Saint John the Divine” was written out of opposition towards this oppression.
Although Nero was enthroned as emperor at 17-years-old, he had demonstrated his talent as a competent judge from before that enthronement. After his enthronement, he boasted tremendous popularity with the citizenry due to his lavish policies, and he had excelled in diplomacy too. He also personally participated in the “Nero Fest” – an athletic meet which has three groups of competitions: music, gymnastics and equestrian – that followed the example of and was hosted after the Olympics.
Because of a rebellion that occurred in the year 69{{n2}}, Nero was driven out of the emperor’s throne and escaped from Rome. He understood while en route that he could not get away, and it is said that he committed suicide by means of a dagger while in tears.
Although he was known for the matter of having a peculiarity to cross-dress, in the “Fate” World, Nero is, in fact, a woman.

### Role within the Game, Selling Points

In the Second Chapter “The Eternal Insanity Empire – Septem”, Nero appeared not as a Servant, but as the active Roman Emperor. She went to war together with the Protagonist and the others in order to protect Rome, which was being threatened by Romulus and the rest of the successive Roman leaders.

In the Fifth Chapter “The Great North American Mythological War – E Pluribus Unum”, Nero reunited with her idol companion Elizabeth Báthory, whose warm friendship was gained by Nero in the Holy Grail War of the Moon, and they were showing their combination style with good coordination.

### Role in Past Works

In “Fate/EXTRA”, the Protagonist there, as Nero’s contractor, was branded with the special designation called “Player (Master)”{{n3}} by Nero. As the Protagonist grew as a Master and continued to deepen their trust in her, Nero had come to bear a stronger, more straightforward favour towards them, and it became inevitable that she got them to pay close attention to her.

### Connections with Characters

#### The Successive Roman Emperors

“Uhuh, each and every one of them are great Roman Emperors! I also cannot afford to lose to them I tell you!”

#### Casko

“I can say with confidence that our relationship was one where we competed ruthlessly against each other at a different stage compared to here but… well, what was the cause of us having our quarrels again?”

#### Emiya

“That red mantle is everywhere you know!”

#### Eliza

“Uhuh; in my Servant life, she is my greatest and most relaxing rival! Her musicianship has just started being right on the mark too!”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Nero’s first-person pronoun is the Japanese ‘yo’ (余), an archaic, first-person singular pronoun used by males, usually by those of high rank like kings and emperors.
2. {{note2}} It should be the year 68 that the rebellion, and subsequently the events leading up to Nero’s death, happened.
3. {{note3}} I decided on translating the Japanese term 奏者 (sousha) as Player instead of Praetor or the other translation terms used before as I feel it fits best with what Nero said: that she is an instrument, and an instrument needs to be played (managed) by the Player (Master).
