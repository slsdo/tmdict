The first one I drew in the beginning was Nero, and because this person was used as the standard for my incremental changes between Ascensions, whenever I look over them now, they’re somewhat simple changes don’t you think? The fact is, I was giving into the temptation that I will draw Roman-style buildings and the Golden Theater as her background, but there’s also a worry where I wondered if they would be a bit too pompous in contrast with her rarity, and also, I wondered if it was alright to have her be at least the first person to give off the feeling that she came from EXTRA, so since I considered those, I decided on a sea of electrons as her background. I’m pleased with the drawing of her Final Ascension. (Wada Arco)
