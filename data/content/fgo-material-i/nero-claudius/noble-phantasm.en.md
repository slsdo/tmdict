Aestus Domus Aurea.
An absolute imperial sphere that allows one’s own aspirations to be realized. It is the “Domus Aurea”, the theater personally designed by Nero herself and constructed in Rome while she was alive, recreated by means of magical energy.
It is a Great Magecraft falsely similar to a Reality Marble – an otherworld that embodies one’s own imagined landscape, created by temporarily overwriting the current World – where the magecraft recreates the theater and structures designed by Nero herself during her lifetime with her magical energy, creating a battleground that works advantageously for her. Unlike a Reality Marble that overwrites the World, this can be deployed/maintained for a long time because it is constructed on top of the World from scratch.
While it is being deployed, imprisoned opponents are weakened, and in the case of customizing the structures, she is also able to change its shapes and functions. Speaking of it in a way that is easy to understand, she can project the structures while disregarding the construction process, wherein she can then invoke the rules established by herself.
The sword skill “Laus Saint Claudius: The Flower’s Imperium that Extols the Maiden” is only available while the theater is still deployed.
