I just requested “I want to draw muscles”, and the responsibility for Romulus turned to me. Since I have heard that he will become the boss character in Chapter 2, I kept in mind of a way to show an air of importance to his frontal appearance so that it does not appear to consist of mere coloured clothing. His whole body being golden in his third stage is said to be Takeuchi’s idea. The posing of his battle sprite had came up with tremendous impact, and I was relieved that it seems they were generally able to accept it(?), surprisingly. Hey, I also happened to draw something that does not look like a gigantic spear? (Koyama Hirokazu)
