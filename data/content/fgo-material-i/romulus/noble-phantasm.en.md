Magna Voluisse Magnum.
The Spear of Nation Building. It was told that the spear was combined with the great tree that symbolizes Rome itself, the tree appearing in a dream that his mother Silvia saw before she had given birth to Romulus by means of a virgin birth. At the occasion of the founding of the nation of Rome, it was said that Romulus thrusted this spear into the Palatium.

As a Noble Phantasm, it is being endowed with tree manipulation abilities, and at the time of its True Name release, the spear will transform/enlarge as the great tree that creates “the past/present/future appearance of the imperial capital of Rome”, washing away the targets according to a torrent of surging waves of trees. A mass weapon Rome.

Moles Necessarie.
Materializes the anecdote where Romulus put to death his beloved younger brother Remus with his own hands as a rampart of love smeared in blood. It is a Barrier Noble Phantasm where a rampart appears and divides the space, protecting the inner part isolated by the walls. Since the appearance of the rampart suddenly rises up from the ground in an instant, depending on the coordinates of his current position, it is even possible for him to cleave his targets with the rampart like a guillotine.
