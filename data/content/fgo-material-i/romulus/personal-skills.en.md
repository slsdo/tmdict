### Imperial Privilege: EX

Skills that essentially cannot be possessed can be acquired for a short time. The Divine Founder is almighty. The relevant Skills this covers are Riding, swordsmanship, fine arts, Charisma, Military Tactics, and many others. Because this is not lower than Rank A, those that are a burden to the body (such as Divinity) can even be acquired.

At the time of being endowed with this Skill, Romulus is sealing his own Divinity Skill that he naturally possesses at a high rank.

### Natural Body: C

The possession of a perfect body as a living being since birth.

It becomes possible to temporarily rank up his Strength parameter. Furthermore, even without training, his muscles are beyond brawny, so no matter how many calories he absorbs, even his figure will not change.

### The Seven Hills: A

Grants blessings to those he personally recognizes as “his own children”.
