Tarasque.
The summoning and usage of the monster Tarasque. The reading is the same as the “O’ Shield of the Drake that Shall Not Let a Blade Pass” Noble Phantasm.

A gigantic head, a shell that grew sharp spikes on it, six legs, and a long tail with spikes containing a poison similar to a scorpion’s growing on it; the Tarasque is surely a monster that possesses such features, and he is reported to be the son of Leviathan as written down in the Old Testament. Being one of the Dragon Kind, and as a monster that can freely move on both land and water, the Tarasque lurked in the Rhône River, sinking ships and eating people; his hard shell entirely repelled all the blades and arrows of the warriors called upon to subjugate him, and he went to breathe out fire at them until they burned out. The one who suppressed such an invincible monster was Saint Martha.

The Tarasque summoned as Martha’s Noble Phantasm thoroughly burns and smashes the enemy camp into nothingness with his Giant Iron Armoured Dragon’s Scorching Great Spin Attack.
