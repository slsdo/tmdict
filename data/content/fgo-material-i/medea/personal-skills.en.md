### High-Speed Divine Words: A

Activates magecraft without needing chants or connecting with her Magic Circuits.
Can use Greater Magecraft as if they were Single Action spells. She says words in the Age of the God’s language, so people of this era can’t hear them.

### Argon Coin (Golden Fleece)

Very expensive.
Jason lead the Argonauts in search of this treasure, but the legitimate owners are her family.
It supposedly can summon a dragon, but since Caster has no Phantasmal Beast summoning skills, this function is unavailable. She can heal by admiring the fleece. It’s so fluffy. Mental healing has surpassed physical-!

### Circe’s Teachings

Princess Medea learned magecraft at the Moon Goddess Hecate’s temple and at the time, a fellow disciple, the witch Circe, was like an older sister to her.
Circe was a true genius of magecraft but also a witch with several personality problems.
Medea learned magic as a princess, so she can’t be called a genuine witch. She probably could never act like the witch she became after being dumped by Jason if it weren’t from the intensive training she took from her great big sis.
