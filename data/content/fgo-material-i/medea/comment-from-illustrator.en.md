Her dress is slender to the knees, vertically long and has few lines, making it hard to draw, so I leaned her body a lot, giving her a livelier vibe. I had to adjust the pose a lot to make her long staff fit into the frame and think about how that change would affect her cape, but then came the third ascension and she loses the cape that defined most of her movement and cover most of most of the area, so I went back and forth a lot when adjusting the balance between the second and third ascensions. Since she is a character who showed a lot of deep expressions in the previous games, I had no idea what mood I should show her. It was difficult to decide. As she exposes her face upon ascension, I decided to draw Medea looking less evil when her face is exposed. (Nekotawawa)
