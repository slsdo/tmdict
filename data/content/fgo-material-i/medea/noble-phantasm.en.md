Rule Breaker.
A dagger that undoes any and all magecraft.
An ultimate anti-magecraft Noble Phantasm that turns objects strengthened by magic, relationships formed by contracts and lifeforms created with magic back to how they were before they were made.
The Witch of Betrayal Medea’s Divinity given physical form as a magical weapon.
It’s as weak as a weapon as it looks like, just as lethal as any normal knife.
