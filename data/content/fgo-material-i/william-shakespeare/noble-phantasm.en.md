First Folio{{n1}}.
The ultimate play that Shakespeare unleashes.
Regardless of friend or foe, the target is made into someone that appears in his plays. On top of that, the target is then thrusted with challenges. Of past regrets for heroes, and of moments of their fall for anti-heroes.
An anti-mind Noble Phantasm that breaks the mind of any and every hero.
