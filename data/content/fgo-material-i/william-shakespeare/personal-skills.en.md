### Enchant: A

Bestowal of concept. It adds powerful function on others or their properties.
Fundamentally, it is a strengthening ability with the purpose of making the Master fight.
He himself watches over the battle as an audience, irritating the Master as he inquires the Master’s psychological state.

### Self-Preservation: B

In exchange of having no combat ability, as long as the Master is safe he is able to escape from most dangers. In other words, he himself never fights at all.
Yet for all that, he himself is fond of high risk high rewards type of tactic.

### King’s Men: C

The Globe. A miniature magic version of Shakespeare’s Noble Phantasm, “Let the Curtains Rise to Thunderous Applause.”
Unlike his Noble Phantasm, it doesn’t consume much magic energy. It summons shadow actors without any combat ability and manipulates them at will.
Shakespeare is the one that decides the shadow actors’ lines, but the shadow actors themselves automatically imitates the target in regards to the lines’ details (such as the tone of the lines or how it is said), so there is no worry of exposure on that part.
Even if one understands that the shadow actors are fake, it requires a powerful force of will in order to break this magic.
