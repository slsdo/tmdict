Gaia whispers to me to keep on drawing, to class change him from a bit of an old man to fullblown old man! Ok, I guess the severity and stress of the manuscript deadline has really piled up on me. Now that I look at it, even the drawing of his last ascension looks like the face of a man finishing his manuscript while chugging energy drinks, all day all night. For his sprite, I really enjoyed giving it the finishing touches of the looks-quite-handsome-if-he-just-stay-silence-but-gives-off-bad-feelings-the-moments-he-opens-his-mouth nuance.
