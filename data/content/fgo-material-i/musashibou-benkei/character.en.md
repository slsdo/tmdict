### Personality

Fundamentally, he acts as a boorish military man…… but, as a matter of fact, he’s quite a funny one, and happens to have a cowardice (or pacifism) that hates battle.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He apparently has a feeling of guilt for not being Benkei to begin with, in some respects solemn. If he’s trusted, he’ll reveal his True Name on his own, and will fight as Hitachibō Kaison.

### Dialogue Examples

『Musashibō Benkei, I have manifested as a spearman. Nice to meet you.』
『What? To fight with Yoshitsune-dono? I don’t mind. Now, whether I have a chance of winning or not is a different issue.』
『…… I, I’m called Kaison. Benkei is here, but I want you to hold to this name.』

### Historical Image · Character Image

The first subordinate of Minamoto no Yoshitsune (Ushiwakamaru), and the most famous warrior monk in Japanese history. Even in modern times, he’s loved in a wide range of stories like kabuki and jōruri. Many legends like Benkei’s imposing stance or Benkei’s crying spot are told nowadays.
Following Yoshitsune until the end, he finally arrived at his lurid last moments striking a daunting pose while receiving countless arrows without giving a single step backwards.
――― The summoned one isn’t Musashibō Benkei, but the fellow subordinate of Yoshitsune, Hitachibō Kaison.
Just before the battle in which Yoshitsune and Benkei met their bloody end, he ran away like a coward.
As an atonement, Kaison uses Benkei as his True Name. In order to make his name eternal, he seals the comicality of his future personality.
According to one theory, he’s said to have lived hundreds of years after becoming a hermit.
