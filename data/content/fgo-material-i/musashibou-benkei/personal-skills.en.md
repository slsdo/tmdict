### Exorcism of Grudging Spirits: A

An incantation of resistance against evil curses by performing the kuji “Rin-pyō-tō-sha-kai-jin-retsu-zai-zen” (curiously, they wrote 臨 instead of 临 for the first syllable). If it succeeds, it’ll seal the opponent’s magecraft.

### Imposing Stance: B

A reproduction skill of a famous episode that Benkei performed.
Of course, since he’s not Benkei himself, he doesn’t have the ability to sublimate it as a Noble Phantasm, it falls into a simple defense enhancement and acknowledgment as a target, a state of receiving concentrated attacks.

### Blank Subscription List

A reproduction skill of a famous episode that Benkei performed.
It forcibly executes a Noble Phantasm sealing order, but since he isn’t Benkei to begin with, the chance of sealing is low.

### Attendant of Iron: C

A reproduction skill of the episode of how Benkei was in the past. Increases the Master’s stamina.
(Not used in 『FateGO』).
