Gohyaku Rakan Fudaraku Tokai.
Calls a large procession of wandering saints. They are travelers that go to a sea passage to Potalaka (a drifting going to attain Buddhahood in life while confined in coffin-like boats with the Western Pure Land as a goal).
In the occasion that those in the spot fail a resistance check, they’re forcibly moved, finally taken to the Pure Land and enter Nirvana. Namu.
In other words, it’s a semi-forced instant death spell, but in the game it only has a chance of inflicting stun and curse.
