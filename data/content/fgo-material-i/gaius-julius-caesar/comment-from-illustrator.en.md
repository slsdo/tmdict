During the moment when I saw the list of orders document for a Caesar of the Saber-class, I thought that ‘Surely he’s not an Artoriaface!?’ Although it was something I thought of, finding the specification for a big FATSO was something unexpected… It was a shock to me.

Given that there were plenty of materials related to Rome, including creative works as well, I got to adopt those materials minutely and design him with such. Although, (suppose) if there was a specification for him as a lean handsome man, I wonder when the diet event will come then…? I’m hoping for one! (Shima Drill)
