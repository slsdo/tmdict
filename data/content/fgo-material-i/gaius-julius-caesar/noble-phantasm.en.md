Crocea Mors.
A golden sword. When its True Name is released, after the first strike that automatically hits the target, Luck Checks are conducted “until one fails”, and it becomes possible for this attack to be granted an additional guaranteed strike no more than the number of checks that had consecutively succeeded. A super consecutive attack.

In close combat, there is no doubt that it has the power of certain victory the moment the enemy is seen (I came, I saw, I conquered), but Caesar himself does not overly feel like drawing out this sword. While he was alive, it appeared that he will never forget how he lost this sword as he carelessly got it stuck in an enemy’s shield.
