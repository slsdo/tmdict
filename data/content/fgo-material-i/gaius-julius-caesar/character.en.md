### Personality

A cunning man. An ambitious person, one who excels at trickery. His gaze is perceptive, hiding a bottomlessness and dangerousness that one cannot neglect. Being a man endowed with a great ambition and an intelligence that one ought to be afraid of, Caesar is a master of ingenuity and speech. A genius of incitement. Having himself changed into a Heroic Spirit, his superior intellect that led him to victory in many battlefields is being expressed as his retention of a high rank in the Military Tactics Skill.

Caesar has a fondness for women. He also likes Rome (he likes the successive Roman Emperors in general. Naturally he likes Nero too). He likes the world. He likes Cleopatra as well.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Caesar will fundamentally not betray his Master. “I’ll warn you in advance, Master. Do take care so that you won’t get assassinated while you sleep for that would be the result of your self-conceit.” Even if those words are expressed with mingled sarcasm, it is an advice out of his true feelings.

Even though the numerous trickeries he committed during his lifetime even caused him to die in the end, Caesar is not regretting about that since that was his own life. However, as he regrets having caused his beloved Cleopatra to shed tears, he thinks that “it’s troublesome” to unravel plots even after becoming a Heroic Spirit and Servant.

Caesar’s wish for the Holy Grail is “to reunite with Cleopatra and acknowledge both her and their son Caesarion.” Because he would be ready to scheme, among other things, before long. “Just let me embrace my son, my son.”

### Dialogue Examples

“Ooh, it’s beautiful. Beautiful. Truly beautiful; that beauty is worthy for Rome, the most valuable asset of the world.”
“My love is wide and deep. Many of the lovers in my lifetime are naturally the fruits of my love.”
“Saber, huh? Saber. What kind of pretext is there to have me as a Saber?”
“Leaving the role of a foot soldier to me. This, this isn’t called a practical use of optimal human resources, you know.”
“————Come now. Advance, the die is cast.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A superpower that continues with wars and power struggles————its name is Rome. If one wants to climb the ranks of the world’s largest assembly, not only was strength based on a blade, as if the blade was a savage tribe of an unexplored territory, proven to be necessary, but so was going through conflict caused accordingly by the clash of sharpened intellects. An enormous vortex of cruelty. And then, Caesar was born.

Sometimes murdering, sometimes being murdered, all according to trickery. That was the state of the Roman ruling classes. Although he temporarily went away from the capital of Rome, after Roman dictator Sulla had died, Caesar chose to plunge himself into the vortex of conspiracies. His first move was where he applied the impeachments of corrupt governors who were oppressing the people of the Roman provinces. With his voice, words, hand movements and bodily gestures, he stirred up the good will of the Roman citizens. He advocated that governing according to ill will must not come about. Receiving tremendous support, even during the time of the Roman consul, Caesar brought down the corrupt with nothing but his speech. His tongue. That is his sword, which was composed of his own truth.

The course of events afterwards was quite favourable. Politics at daytime, being done towards the masses. Schemes at nighttime, killing his enemies while protecting his own life. These two courses of actions continued to be repeated. After keeping up his successful career favourably, Caesar took up a new post as Roman governor of Hispania Tarraconensis. Immediately defeating a large number of rebellious forces that had yet to obey Rome as well as getting the better of the Orient, and after carrying out his triumphant return, Caesar became a Roman consul. It was the beginning of the First Triumvirate. And then it began; the Gallic Wars.

Repeatedly crushing and suppressing his oppositions such as the Gauls, the Belgae, the Germanics and the Aquitanians, and utterly defeating Britannia occasionally even despite the hard battles, Caesar spent over several years to subjugate the whole land of Gaul. He won fame as the strongest general, and he received tremendous support from the masses. After the death of Crassus, one of the three triumvirs, the great commander Pompey, the other person left in the three triumvirs, broke off relations with Caesar, and he was later assassinated; Caesar then became the most powerful person in Rome in both name and reality.

And then————Caesar met her by chance. In Alexandria, the capital city of Egypt. Cleopatra, the queen who is both the joint ruler with and the ceremonial wife of Ptolemy XIII. It was love at first sight. He was forty-years-old{{n1}}, but his companion was a young girl separated by no less than twenty years in age. Speaking of her characteristic beauty, it is an iron resolution which showed to him that it was creeping into this foundation of his and resolved him, it is a uniqueness that regards comparatively highly of her own country and people, and it is as if those became the form of that temperament and pride of hers. Upon seeing that, Caesar swore to protect the beautiful young queen. For him who freely proceeded with marriages as well as divorces if it is for the objective of political strife, and for him who came to make a move on many women for fun, that was his first love.

Together with Cleopatra, Caesar dreamt of the second coming of the “Roman-Egyptian Empire” and its influence that King Iskandar once accomplished; thus, he removed Ptolemy XIII and subjugated Egypt. He invaded every kingdom around him one after another, and he kept on gaining total control of the Roman Senate faction lurking secretly in those countries. After gaining total control of Hispania, he finally accomplished the subjugation of Rome. Caesar reigned over ancient Rome as the first Roman dictator in perpetuity, and he tells his beloved queen this: “There’s now not a person who will hinder me. I seized all of Rome. In the event of the Parthian Kingdom Campaign being successful, I’ll certainly welcome you as my wife officially, and I’ll show and announce Caesarion to the world far and wide as our son.”

However. That was not done. Caesar truly had all of Rome in his hands, but the vortex of cruelty surrounding Rome turned into something like a curse, and it did not allow the days of peace and love to continue. That is, it came in the form of a single blade. At the Theater of Pompey, Brutus, his loyal retainer who became a tool for the Roman Senate faction remnants, raised overhead a single knife and————
