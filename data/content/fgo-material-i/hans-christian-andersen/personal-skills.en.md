### Human Observation: A

The skill to observe and understand humans. He doesn’t simply observe them, but also hypothesizes their life, preferences, even their whole live; a strong memory that doesn’t forget this informations becomes an important thing to have.
THe root of Andersen, who is known to be a pessimist, is not that of rejection, but understanding. What he can do is simply to write stories, but that is exactly why he continously swore that he shall be more earnest than anyone else in what he speaks of.

### High Speed Incantation: E

The ability to hasten magic incantation speed.
It seems like in his case, instead of magic it benefits the progress of writing his manuscript.

### Innocent Monster: D

Indicating the depth of distorted truth by means of rumours, without concern for the actual person’s own will or appearance.
In Andersen’s case, it is the “curse of the readers”.
