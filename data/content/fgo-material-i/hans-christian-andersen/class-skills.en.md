### Territory Creation: D

Creation of a territory that is advantageous to himself as a magus.
In Andersenâ€™s case, it is not a type of territory created for intercepting incoming enemies, but one that bewilders even the eyes of the foolish enemy Master.
In the Study he created in a place no one can found, he skips out wo-, no, continously moves his brush.
A certain Master had had her patience run out with this style of overtruanc-, no, procrastination; she then made a small box, locked him inside, and make him write as fast as he can.

### Tool Creation: C

The ability to create various tools by means of magic.
Although he does not know of any magic, it seems like he can more or less write up things by his literary works that put his Noble Phantasm to practical use.
