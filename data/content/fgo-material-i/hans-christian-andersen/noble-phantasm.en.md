Märchen Meines Lebens{{n1}}.
The unpolished manuscript of his written autobiography “The Fairy Tale of My Life”. Each page of this document utilizes the magic energy provided from the people who loved the author known as Andersen, takes the form of “the Andersen that the readers see in their heart”, and capable of actions as Andersen’s offshoot (bunshin).
However, the true value of this Noble Phantasm is displayed in beginning this book anew and writing a full copy about the observed target’s ideal life and way of being. If the book comes out well, it establishes itself as a Noble Phantasm and makes a target grows in accordance how the target is written in the book. The degree of the effect escalates depending on the progress of the manuscript; several pages would only make few mere coincidences occurs, but should the manuscript is finished, it’s possible to even make the target grow even to their “greatest form”.
It almost appears as an omnipotent Noble Phantasm, but it is difficult to put this Noble Phantasm to practical use. The time taken to write the manuscript is one obvious problem, but his own negative outlook of live and his pride as an author do not allow for a convenient development, and if the target is not someone that stimulates his inspiration, there is the risk of the manuscript becoming a poor piece of work.
