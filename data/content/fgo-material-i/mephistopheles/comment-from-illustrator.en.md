I viewed him as and designed him in the image of an abnormal, visual-looking clown. In relation to his clothing, because the Director was worried about it, having said that “Shimokoshi-kun, they are not good clothes to wear when he is getting on a bicycle”, they had changed into snug clothing that is like a cycling jersey. I tried to make his overall design insect-like and with gaudy-ish hues. Adding tactile-like horns of a longhorn beetle, and so on.

His weapon. I thought it would be normal if it was a cane (stick), but it was going to be a pair of scissors by the time his character design came together, and they particularly have no significance. Say, it was nice for Mr. Koyasu to be given the assignment for his voice, given that I was drawing Mephistopheles’ pictures while imagining his voice, so when the cast was decided, I was happy. Just like Mephistopheles’ image! (Shimokoshi)
