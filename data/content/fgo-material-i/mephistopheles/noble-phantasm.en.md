Tick-Tock Bomb.
A kind of Witchcraft that intentionally lays bugs into one’s Magic Circuits and the spiritual bodies of Servants before making them explode by causing an impact on them. Specifically, they appear in some image that is like a combination of a pocket watch and a bomb. He installs these on the field so they would explode on contact————or rather, that is how he pretends to use them in such a method.

But actually, on the occasion of having its “True Name” invoked, it results in a situation where the targets that are within a medium range will have bombs inserted inside their bodies. In this situation, a check based on one’s resistance to curses is carried out to prevent this. The maximum number of bombs per person is five, and in addition, including the ones installed on the field, etc., it is possible to install a total of thirty bombs. Of course, he can just finish the targets off right there and then if he detonates the bombs inserted inside their bodies, but Mephistopheles likes to take the opportunity to have the overall picture of the bombs being inside their bodies stand out to them on purpose, choosing a means of having them obey him as well by threatening them. It is possible to say that this unscrupulous Noble Phantasm is as if his trickiness and ruthlessness had combined together.
