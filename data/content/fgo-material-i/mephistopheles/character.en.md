### Personality

Mephistopheles acts as someone cheerful and easygoing, and because he takes up a jestful attitude at all times no matter the kind of occasion it is, one cannot feel a sense of seriousness from him. That is to say, he is more cruel than what anyone can imagine, and he is similarly cruel towards his Master too. He is really like “making fun” of the whole world, and if he is happy, it seems he is willing to kill Masters as well.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

At a first glance, Mephistopheles faithfully serves in a cheerful manner. However, regarding his Master, he basically does not think of them as anything but “a toy to entertain himself with” to a degree, and he will drive his Master into despair if given the chance. In the case where his Master has vigilantly restrained every way for him to act against them, even though unwillingly, Mephistopheles will accept the relationship between a master and a servant. He basically does not take up the “disobeying one’s commands” attitude. However, it is a different story of whether or not he properly understands and acts on the commands.

And from there progressing one step even further, where a situation has appeared in that his Master had deepened their bond with him while accepting all of those wickedness and immaturity of his, it seems Mephistopheles will fight while gambling his life for the sake of his Master, all with pleasure and while laughing.

### Dialogue Examples

“Greetings greetings. Caster, I have come. Although it is regretful in that it appears your expectations have been infringed upon, for as you can see, I am not particularly the one you call a ‘devil’. Please kindly understand that these horns are decorations.”
“Oh? Master. You are also making an amusing face, no? What happened? Have you made up your mind on what you even want to do if it is for the sake of having your wish granted? Peaceful, so peaceful like a single child’s life.”
“Oh dear! Master. You are a human being who cannot help being very careless! It is no wonder I have been summoned as you have only succeeded in doing reckless things!”
“Make the name of Mephistopheles my True Name! Let us drive a humorous despair into our enemies!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Georg Faust is the model for the protagonist in Goethe’s play, “Faust”. He is an astrologer and an alchemist, and the devil he contracted with is Mephistopheles.

Mephistopheles is the Devil of Temptation in “Faust”, and he played a bet with God on whether or not he was made to corrupt Dr. Faust.

In the end, Mephistopheles was defeated in this bet, and his wish to acquire Faust’s soul had not come true, but it is said that the real Faust, in the middle of his alchemy experiment, was killed in a bombing where his whole body violently exploded and broke apart into five pieces. It did not become clear whether this was Mephistopheles carrying out his contract, or if something separate was the main cause of Faust’s death.

… In this work, Mephistopheles is a kind of familiar casted by Dr. Faust; namely, a sort of homunculus. Dr. Faust, with his gifted engineering, had advanced homunculus technology several generations ahead of his time, but because of his strange sense of aesthetics, he chose to strengthen the homunculus’ self (ego). A homunculus that is exceedingly full of human traits————That is the key part of “Mephistopheles”; furthermore, by being clad in that legend, the Servant Caster, Mephistopheles, was born.

“I… was born to be a Servant.”

Pay special attention to his face that feigns ignorance. Indeed, it may not become known that although Mephistopheles was born to be a Servant, since there was no need for him to have a person who he could call ‘Master’————
