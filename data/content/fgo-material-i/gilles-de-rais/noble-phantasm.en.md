Prelati’s Spellbook.
A grimoire that is a mana furnace itself. Gilles de Rais himself isn’t a legitimate magus nor has any grounding in magecraft, but this grimoire performs magic instead.
That means, it’s an exclusive Noble Phantasm for him as a mage. Regardless of the owner’s skills, the grimoire itself executes High-Thaumaturgy/Greater Rituals and performs the summoning of water demons containing attributes in accordance to the deep sea system. For this reason, it’s fine that Gilles de Rais himself just uses the sea demons he called. The individual power of the sea demons is weak in comparison with a Servant, but the classification as Anti-Army isn’t for show, as it’s possible to summon them in dozens. Fuel efficiency is good since it’s possible to summon new sea demons from the defeated ones. Also, it is possible to summon a super-gigantic sea demon by disregarding execution (can’t control it).
However, in the end it’s just 「summoning magecraft performed by the grimoire」, the summoning itself is not a 「miracle of the Noble Phantasm」. If constant mana supply from the grimoire is cut, the summoned demons can’t last in the current world, and will be eliminated if the mana supply is interrupted even for a moment.
