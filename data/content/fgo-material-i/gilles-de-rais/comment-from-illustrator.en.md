It was lots of fun drawing Gilles de Rais’ rich facial expressions. I also had fun as a user with his appearances in the first chapter Orléans, limited time event, etc. I was also happy to see that the several growing states after the evolution were reproduced so solidly in the battle graphics! Please take care of Caster Gilles de Rais as the man in charge of the tentacles, guys!! (Azusa)
