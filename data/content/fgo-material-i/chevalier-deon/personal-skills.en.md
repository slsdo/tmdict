### Beautiful Looks: C

Coupled with their attire, one is endowed with a beauty that makes it difficult for others to identify their gender as either male or female due to a special aura (and not because of their figure). Functions as a plus modifier for one’s checks at the time of having negotiations with either men or women. Also, all effects that attempt to target a specific gender are disregarded against them.

### Self-Suggestion: A

A powerful suggestion that makes oneself as its target. One possesses a high defensive efficacy against the effects of magecrafts/Skills/Noble Phantasms that exert influence on the mind.

D’Éon freely uses this Skill, perfectly conducting themselves as a man at times, and as a woman at times. At times, even their own body is made to change————

### Mind’s Eye (True): C

An insight cultivated through discipline and training. One possesses a combat logic to grasp with a presence of mind the state of affairs around themselves and the abilities of the enemies in a predicament, deducing the means of survival left in that situation.

D’Éon has this Skill because of their experience where they continued to act as a spy in foreign countries. It is this explanation that said person is not just merely cute.
