During the initial stages, I have him concealed with mantle just like Jack-chan, and tries to give off the feeling that as he opens his mantle the clothing themselves looks as if it becomes a glorious opera stage. Which is why there are parts that imitates stained glass and curtains. Like how one would understand from seeing the drawing of his last ascension, with large influence from the movie Amadeus at first I put up a design that blends in various of homages, like Amadeus’ father’s clothes, or his form when returning to the requiem, but midway I went with emphasizing his arrangement, so it feels like the original prototype design has mostly been removed.
