Requiem for Death.
The mystical tune that has its origins on the legend where prior to his death, the death god requested of him to compose a funeral march.
Those who hears this composition will have to do a resistance check on MGI and LCK. Should the check result in failure, then all of their physical status are forcefully degraded by 2 ranks, and they receives powerful continous damage that bypasses all sorts of defensive magic, ability, or armor.
Should the check result in a success, then their status degrades for only a rank, and the continuous damage is reduced by a half.
It is an open secret that its true nature is not a tune that summons the merciless death god, but one that consoles the compassionate death god.
