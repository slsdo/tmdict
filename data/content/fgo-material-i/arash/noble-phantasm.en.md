Stella.
An arrow shot with all his strength, exactly like in the legend. The ultimate shot.
A max-ranged remote attack that literally “splits the land”, ending all conflicts.
Due to the sheer amount of energy used for it, it also doubles as an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm.
According to the legend, Arash created the “border” between Persia and Turan with his ultimate arrow. He split the land. His shooting range was exact 2500 kilometers. The legend also tells that in exchange for using this superhuman special move, he had his whole body scattered in all directions and lost his life.
Since it’s affects a wide territory instead of focusing on a single point, it’s classified as an Anty-Army Noble Phantasm, but considering its range, it would make more sense to call it an Anti-Country Noble Phantasm.
However, it is one-use only. Because Arash, the user, will lose his life without fail.
Since it destroys both the Noble Phantasm and the user at the same time, it is in a certain sense a double Broken Phantasm.
