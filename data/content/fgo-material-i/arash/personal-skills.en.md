### Clairvoyance: A

Good eyesight. Perception of distant targets and improved kinetic vision.
Having this Skill on Rank A or higher (which Arash does) enables even one type of future sight (estimating the future) and mind reading.

### Robust Health: EX

One of the many traces of the Age of Gods Arash has is the special healthy body he had since he was born.
The stories of how Arash never got hurt even on the battlefields and never got sick turned into a Skill.
It ranks up his Endurance stat and reduces the damage he takes when he is attacked.
It is a composite Skill, as the Skill Poison Resistance is included on it.

### Bow and Arrow Construction: A

He is a designer and builder of “bows” thanks to the being blessed with Goddess Armaiti’s knowledge. He can instantly make bows and arrows if he has the materials.
He needs physical material for bows, but arrows can be made by just spending mana. With this, Arash can shoot countless arrows in quick succession.
