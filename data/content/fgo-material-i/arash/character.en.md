A cheerful and deeply righteous hero.
He smiles at everyone and encourages people a lot.
In times of peace he is quite kind and tolerant, but in times of war he is extremely cold and rational. Although he has the composure necessary to instantly accurately calculate the trajectories of all the countless arrows on the battlefield, he rarely shows this side of himself to others.
He is a man who does what it needs to be done when it needs to be done.
He doesn’t hesitate.
Doesn’t anguish either.
No matter the land or age, he is here to serve the wishes of those who want peace.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He will try to start friendly conversations but will always keep enough distance not be considered as rude or impolite.

He has no wish for the Grail.

Even now, he never forgets how he lived as a hero who saved the people and how he gave everything he had to the people.

### Historical Image · Character Image

A great hero from Ancient Persian legends.
As a soldier under the last West Asian king of the Age of the Gods, King Manuchehr (a legendary king who ruled over Ancient Persia for 120 years. Grandson of King Fereydun, the hero who fought against Zahhak, an avatar of the evil dragon Azi Dahaka), he was the last archer, ending the war 60-year war between Persia and Turan.
A savior hero who brought peace and tranquility to both countries.
His story says that by shooting an arrow with all his strength, he ended all battles and performed a feat that exceeds human comprehension, but in exchange he burst and scattered his entire body, meeting his end.

In Persian mythology, at the end of a long war between two countries, the enemy army of Turan sieged King Manuchehr’s army and this leads to the kings of both countries deciding to sign a peace treaty and establish their national borders.
That entailed making someone climb Mount Damavand and shoot an arrow to the East from there, and the place where this arrow fell would mark the location of the national border.
The only volunteer at the time was the Persian army’s best archer, Arash.
During the first month of the summer, on a sunny morning of Tirgan (Persian for “summer solstice”), Arash drew his bow more than ever before and shot an arrow.
It’s said that at that moment his body went flying in all directions.
Most legends say the arrow kept flying the entire morning and landed at noon on the coast of the Oxus River in central Asia, 2500 km away from the shooting point.
That river remained as the two countries’ border line until the 10th Century, when the Mongol armies pushed the Persian territory to the south.

The distance the arrow flew is different in various sources.
One version says the distance was 1000 farsakhs and other says the distance was a 40 days walk.
Most stories say the arrow flew from the daybreak until noon, but some say it flew from daybreak to sunset.

The name Arash in Ancient Persian has meanings associated with “cheerfulness” and lack of “common sense”.
He is also known as Arash Kamangir. Or “swift archer”.
Translating it to English, Arash Kamangir would be “Arash the Archer”. In West Asia, the word “archer” refers to the peace-bringing Arash.
In Iran, he is celebrated in Tirgan Festivals on summer solstices.
Even now, the hero Arash is still loved by the West Asians.

### Connections with Characters

#### Ozymandias

Both acknowledge each other as heroes of the same era.

#### Hassan of Serenity

Since her entire body is a poisonous Noble Phantasm, she is someone who “cannot be touched by anyone”, but Arash is an exception to this rule. Because poison doesn’t affect him.

#### Arthuria/King Arthur

Arash tends to think quite often about King Arthur, as he is like a symbol of the vestiges of the Age of the Gods.
