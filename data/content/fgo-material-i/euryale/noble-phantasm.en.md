Eye of the Euryale.
The charm of the goddess, capable of turning heroes into captives by a single blow, taking form as a Noble Phantasm.
On her bow, her bewitching charm; on her arrowheads, her sweet, sweet whispers. An arrow that will shoot down the hearts of any male, be they a human or a god.
Its appearance is truly divine. Also cute. A golden bow patterned with heartmarks all over it.

Say, isn’t that the God Cupid’s… is what her younger sister was about to say before meeting a terrible fate.
