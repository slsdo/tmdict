As I was thinking of making them to have same hair color but different clothing detail, I thought what if “the two who I would’ve normally spend time to mirror trace each other” becoming slightly different little by little? So I had the elder big sister’s clothing layer to face inward while hers to face outward. I wanted to use anemone and cyperus for her headdress’ flowers, but although I want to split the latter in ones and twos, it became too hard to prepare it, so I ended up with the simple motif instead. She gives off a refreshed feeling comparatively (in contrast with the elder big sister).{{n1}}

1. {{note1}} the whole thing is this: ヘッドドレスのはなに二輪草と三輪草, 後者を二つと一つにわけて使いたかったのですがうまく仕込むのが難しく単純なはなモチーフにな っています, 比較的スッと気持ちを出してくれそうな姉様のイメージです and it was long and some parts I’m not sure I get right so if somebody got a better rendering of it Im all ears.
