It would have been good if the picture for her second stage was her first stageâ€¦ I carefully drew in a way to add volume to her breasts, legs, and so on to show the impression of a motherly and tall character. Her scary facial expressions and third stage are very popular, so I am very happy. Thankful~ (Aotsuki Takao)
