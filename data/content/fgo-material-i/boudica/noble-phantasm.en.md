Chariot of Boudica.
A chariot. Its proper form is a chariot drawn by two fine horses. It represents Britannia, and as Britannia is a symbol of protection, it boasts high durability capabilities.

By releasing its True Name, the chariot makes its appearance and protects Boudica and her comrades. Although it has acquired a flight ability by receiving the divine protection of the Celtic gods, the offensive power of its charge is not particularly high. Its proper use is to function as a “shield” to protect comrades.

The figure of Boudica driving the chariot can even be seen in modern times as a bronze statue in London, at the Thames Path in the Westminster area.

Sword of Boudica.
A one-handed sword crowned with the name of “Victory”, just like Boudica herself. But for all that, it is by no means a Sacred Sword of the Planet, nor does it also mean that victory has been promised. A sword of an incomplete wish.

For its ability, it can shoot out a somewhat small magical energy projectile. This mass of magical energy is not powerful enough to the extent of being able to kill a Servant in one hit, but it is possible to fire them in rapid succession because of its low magical energy consumption, so the Noble Phantasm has relatively excellent usability. This ability can even be used without invoking its True Name. Whenever its True Name is released, it can unleash a barrage of multiple magical energy projectiles.
