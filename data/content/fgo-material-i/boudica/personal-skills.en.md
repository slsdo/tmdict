### Battle Continuation: A

The ability to continue combat.

Combat is possible even while bearing injuries that place one on the verge of death, and they can remain alive so long as they do not receive a decisive fatal wound.

Boudica’s anecdote of her having continued to battle against the mighty Roman Imperial Army with an indomitable fighting spirit has been changed into this Skill.

### Vow to the Goddess: B

A vow to Andraste, the Goddess of Victory in ancient Britannia. It grants a plus modifier to attacks against opponents one has determined as an enemy that they must triumph over. In Boudica’s case, the modifier comes into play only against opponents that are affiliated with Rome. It is particularly effective against Romans.

### Andraste’s Divine Protection: A

A divine protection bestowed by Andraste, the Goddess of Victory. On the occasion of group battles, it grants a plus modifier to all checks made by Boudica and her comrades. Especially in battles with defensive objectives, it demonstrates its maximum effect.
