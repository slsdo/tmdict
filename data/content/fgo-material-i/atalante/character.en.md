### Personality

Atalante is fundamentally stubborn because of the wish she has in saving all children in the world. Due to her nature of being brought up together with animals, she is an extreme realist except when against children. Her outlook on life and death is more severe than a human being’s, basically not showing any mercy towards the weak… provided that children are excluded.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Atalante embraces the grand desire of saving all children. Regarding that, taking an unsparing attitude even towards her Master, in the situation where she does not catch sight of her Master having a zeal in obtaining the Holy Grail, she will even slay her Master. Nonetheless, if one goes along with her entirely while respecting her dream, she will even probably hand over a golden apple… Well, speaking of faults, regarding unfaithfulness in comparison to other Greek heroes, Atalante deals with that fault in a strict manner.

### Dialogue Examples

“Hmph, too slow. In that case, thou probably cannot keep up with me.”
“Master, thou have to become faster than me on foot.”
“There is only one wish I want to make on the Holy Grail. A blessing for all children, please…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Atalante is a huntress who appears in Greek Mythology and is the daughter of Iasus, the King of Arcadia. However, she was abandoned on the mountains immediately after she was born and was brought up by a female bear sent by Artemis, a virgin goddess who felt pity for her. Thereafter, Atalante was discovered by hunters who threaded into the mountains, and she also became a huntress later on.

Atalante boasts to be the fastest among humans, and right after becoming one of the few female crewmembers on the Argo, she happened to meet the hero Meleager.

Meleager was charmed by Atalante, and he invited her to the extermination of the Calydonian Monstrous Beast, but this resulted in giving rise to a tragedy right after this event. For the sake of exterminating this Monstrous Beast that was dispatched by Artemis, who got angry with a king who was being negligent in offering her a sacrifice, Atalante and the others exhausted their efforts in a desperate attempt to hunt down the boar. However, although Meleager pierced the finishing blow, he handed over the achievement to Atalante, who was the first one to hit her arrow onto the boar, this being an act of good will towards Atalante, or Meleager having thought that it is simply something that should be followed as a hero.

Concerning the males————they held displeasure towards that, where they cannot grow to be simply tolerant and were saying that they possess skills greater than Atalante, who is a female————A fight suddenly occurred between Meleager and his relatives, and Meleager was inflicted with a deadly curse.

Regarding Meleager, it is unclear what kind of feelings Atalante had been embracing for him. However, she seemed to have watched the outcome of a man who decided to love her get dragged into a tragedy, while regarding her father’s persuasion to marry, she tried to escape the unreasonable demand thrusted at her, but she could not accomplish that either.

As far as she is concerned, Atalante exists as a symbol of purity for children while simultaneously, she is an existence that projected her very own former self. Although she was saved by the hands of the gods, it is nearly beyond redemption for the rest of the children. She, who materialized as a Servant, entrusts the salvation of children to the Holy Grail. All children throughout the world, far and wide————That quest is without any reward, and yet, even though she is aware that it is a difficult challenge that is close to impossible to accomplish, she will chase after that dream for eternity.

In addition, when she became an Argonaut, Atalante had interactions with her companion Peleus, who is the father of Achilles. In regards to this modest young man, he cannot look at the egoism of heroes in Greek Mythology, and it was, among other things, an aspect for her to think about all right.

### General Armaments

The Bow of the Heavens (Tauropolos)… a large bow she received from the gods.

### Connections with Characters

#### Heracles

A member of the Argonauts. The strongest, the invincible, the almighty! It is difficult to approach him who is excessively powerful.

#### Medea

A member of the Argonauts. At the moment when she met Medea, Atalante requested for a moment of time with her before long, and the memories with Medea (as a Lily) were touching lovely… And then, when Atalante tried to converse with a samurai who happened to be casually nearby, she burst into laughter as she fainted in agony.

#### Artemis

The goddess Atalante believes in.

“I’m okay, even sweets art REALLY okay. No problem. I’m okay after all. I’ll bear with it. I’ll persevere.”
