Only in this place, there are people saying that they’re poor at drawing characters with animal ears, isn’t that right?… Although, I think what everyone ponders about is, “What’s going on with the section for her original ears!? Four ears? Holes? Hey, anything else?” they said…

When I think about it, rather than saying she’s like this child or beast, isn’t she an insect or something? I’m thinking something like that. Atalante is like that sort of insect girl (her mouth isn’t too bad), but doesn’t she seem to be presented as very cute? (Rin Kususaga)
