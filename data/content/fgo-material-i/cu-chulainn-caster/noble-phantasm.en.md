### Wicker Man: Cage of Scorching, Consuming Flames

Wicker Man. It materializes a giant made from small tree branches. The giant is covered in flames, and attacks its target with powerful fire and heat damage.

The torso of the giant functions as a cage, usually there would be sacrifice trapped inside. However, when materializing as a Noble Phantasm, the giant does not receive a sacrifice, and instead unleashes his fury against the gods while seeking one.

This isn’t a secret rune technique, but rather a Noble Phantasm representative of the celt druids given to Cu Chulainn, as he’s summoned as a celt magus who controls fire.

### Ochd Deug Odin: Seal of the Great God

Ochd Deug Odin. In modern terminology, it’d be called Matrix Wodan. It is a Noble Phantasm activated by chanting its true name and using all 18 primordial runes obtained from Scathach at the same time. The power of the rune possessed by the great Odin is released temporarily and deals inmense magic damage to the enemy camp. It also removes all buff effects from enemies, and reduces all their stats by 1 rank. In case of the enemy possessing passive NPs, these are cancelled for one or two turns.

An extremely powerful ultimate attack that is not utilized in FGO.

It’s possible that usage restrictions could be set up by Odin, but the details will be left unknown here.
