### Personality

Basically the same person as the Cu from Fate/Stay Night.

There isn’t a big change in his personality.

Even if his abilities and equipment change, there’s no mistake that this is the same person. Though Cu himself seems to find this role a bit difficult and sometimes mutters something like ‘this doesn’t feel right’.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He doesn’t really talk about his wish for the grail. If he were pressed to say it it’d be something like ‘I want my spear’, but of course that’s not the goal with which he’s manifested.

Having been summoned as a Caster, it seems he’s taken it upon himself to act as a guide. Not as a true druid, but rather just something temporary…

As long as they’re together, he will continue to shine a light on his Master’s path.

### Dialogue Examples

“Woah. So I’m a Caster this time, huh…Oh it’s you. Have we met before?”

“Well, I’ll look forward to your work as a Master”

“The grail, huh…That thing and I have been linked for a while.”

“Good work. I did pretty good on my burning too, huh?”

“I’d like to try being summoned as a Saber some time.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A hero from Celtic, Ulster legend.

A member of the Knights of the Red Branch and the strongest warrior in Ulster. A hero who received who used the demonic spear obtained from Scathach, ruler of the Land of Shadows, to gain fame, and also used the runes given to him by his master.

Unlike his Lancer self, his Caster version manifests as a user of diverse magecraft that inflicts pain upon his enemies with them. Apparently he uses the Ansuz rune for his fire attacks.

### General Armaments

Long-range attacks with runes. The Ansuz rune materializes in the air when he uses fire attacks.

He can also fight at close range with his weapons. In this case, he temporarily raises his STR stat to A and fights with his oak staff or sword.

He doesn’t use any metal as armor.

### Miscellaneous

The same person as the Cu from FSN.

Due to his different class, his appearance also changed. He can change his hairstyle. He does not use metal armor. (Hard armor isn’t necessarily unallowed. Even if it’s not metal, he can still use something made from ceramic or bone.)
