Formation of No Return.
A formation laid by a certain famous strategist upon deciding his army’s retreat.
The formation of huge rocks bewilders invaders and drives them to death.
As a Noble Phantasm, it is a great thaumaturgy that compulsorily alters the location of the enemy into the Shí Bīng Bā Zhèn.
As long as they do not escape from within it, the enemies becomes targets of additional damage that accumulates every turn.

1. {{note1}} [Shí Bīng Bā Zhèn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Sentinel_Maze).
2. {{note2}} My chinese friend said translating the name of this 2 NP is like trying to translate a japanese name; certainly possible translating individual kanji but you know, theyre names. Shí Bīng Bā Zhèn is mostly known in the western as Stone Sentinel Maze, but even then its not 100% accurate. Meaning and context wise my chinese friend said that for Chu Shi Biao’s closest rendering is Memorial Upon War.
