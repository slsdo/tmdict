The idea of the third ascension being Waver felt like a good idea when it struck me, but upon the implementation I felt somewhat anxious if it would be a disappointing development for those who like El-Melloi II. I am really relieved that I donâ€™t need to worry about that thanks to the option of being able to choose the ascension stage. (Takeuchi Takashi)
