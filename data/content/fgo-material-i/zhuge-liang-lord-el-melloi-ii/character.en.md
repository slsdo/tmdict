### Historical Image · Character Image

The description below is not of Zhuge Kongming, but of the basis of his outer shell, Lord El-Melloi II.

Lord El-Melloi II is the representative head of House El-Melloi, one of the twelve nobles that rule over and manage the Clock Tower that is the center of Magic Association. A lecturer of the department of Modern Magic, all of his pupils had managed to grow into excellent magi.
It is said that should he ever recruit his pupils to his own faction, the Clock Tower’s influence chart would easily change; but he himself has no intention to do so.

His insight in observing the true nature of a human has reached the point of being sublimated as a Servant’s Skill. No matter how much a famed magus may conceal his or her thaumaturgy, he possesses the terrifying ability to divulge it without any constraint.

Normally, even if the outer shell is El-Melloi II, in the inside is still Zhuge Kongming and he should have conduct himself as Zhuge Kongming. However, upon the agreement of the goal of protecting the Human Order, there is no problem whichever between the two that holds the reign of the body; in the end of the discussion, Lord El-Melloi with his discernment of the modern world was decided to become a Servant.
Although he himself is dissatisfied of being unable to do something with his own power, he do understand that he would not be able to do anything alone. He vows that he will protect the Human Order together with the other Servants.

Furthermore, there is no change of his very power as a Servant or in his knowledge quantity upon his repeating spirit foundation’s ascension, which in the end returns his form to that of a young boy (roughly 19 years old).
According to a certain ill-natured goddess, the situation of him fighting as the leading part being his form as a young boy is most fitting. Perhaps for Lord El-Melloi II himself, the unforgettable battle in which he shines the most is the one of this moment.
