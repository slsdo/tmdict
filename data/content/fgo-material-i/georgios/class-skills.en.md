### Magic Resistance: A

Cancels all A rank magic and below. As a matter of fact, modern magi are incapable of hurting him.
Even if he is thoroughly assaulted by a magus’ spells and magic, he will emerge completely unscathed.
It would not be wrong to call such an ability a “magus killer”.

### Riding: B

Capable of operating most rides with above average capacity, but he is unable to ride phantasmal kin.
It can be considered that his own ability as a Rider does not really amount to that extent, and it is the ability of Bayard, the horse that was given to him, that is truly outstanding.
