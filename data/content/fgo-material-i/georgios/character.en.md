### Personality

Exceedingly earnest, with a gentle and sincere personality; an ideal saint from any point of view.
Even those who calls him dull and uninteresting would probably end up trusting that personality of his and believe that he would never tell a lie.
His hobby is camera. If he is summoned to the modern era, he would almost always carry a camera with him.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Even that gentle disposition of his would of course change, depending on the Master, .
….That being said, the very fact that they are able to summon Georgius probably already shows how the Master’s personality is to begin with.

He would be sincere towards the Master, but his personality is not one that would hold back on admonishing them. At times severe, at times lenient. One can say that his role is that of an ideal teacher.

### Dialogue Examples

“This be Ascalon’s truth. Thy are a dragon; and thus, sinful! Ascalon!”
“Rider, Georgius. I have come in response to your summon. Come; we shall do the very best we can.”
“My hobby, is it? Hmm… I suppose it would be the camera by which was handed over to me since I had been summoned. Indeed, taking pictures wherever I go is a private enjoyment of mine.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Georgius (Saint Georgius, St. George, Sant Jordi, Sancti Georgii). A saint of the teaching of Christ.
In possession of the mystical blade Ascalon, he is famous of the act of dragonslaying.
He is also a man of valor, accomplishing martyrdom for the sake of the teaching of Christ.
His main anecdotes include the close to the original “Golden Legend”{{n1}}, as well as the mythical “Seven Champions of Christendom” where various arms of the witch made an appearance.

There is also a theory that states that he had appeared as a reinforcement during the Crusades, leading the force of the heaven.

### Connections with Characters

#### Marta

A close friend in the saint team. He places tremendous trust in her.
“Although I must say, I am more well known.”

#### Jeanne d’Arc
A close friend in the saint team, albeit on a different branch. As a fellow saint, he is quite proud of her fame which rivals or even surpasses his own.
“Although I must say, I am quite stronger.”

#### Jeanne Alter

Something of a mishap that defiles the name of a saint. Perhaps it was due to such a shock, that Georgius is incapable of seeing Jeanne Alter.
“Although I must say, my camera is somewhat out of focus.”
