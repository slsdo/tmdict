I had intended to draw a robin (the bird) riding on the back of his hand, but it doesn’t mesh well in the drawing, so I put it on his shoulder instead. The result ends up a bit of a generic low pose. I feel like I’m receiving thoughts that said it’s fine, we’ll take down the ingame version that has the robin on his hand, we’re worn out, but we’ll do it anyway! I’m sorry… I’m really sorry…
I’m really pleased with the drawing of his final ascension the same way I do with Nero’s. (Wada Arco)
