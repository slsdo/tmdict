Yew Bow.
A bow created from the yew tree located in the forest where he had based himself during his live.
A yew tree is considered by the Celts and Norsemen as a type of holy tree. The act of making a bow out of a yew tree has the significance of the ritual on “becoming one with the forest”. To add, yew tree is also considered to be the tree that leads to the underworld.
It holds the ability to instantaneously amplify and discharge the impurities (poison and disease) within the target’s inside; should the target carries poison with him/her, it would result in the poison exploding like gunpowder.
Invoking it in the case of the opponent already afflicted with a poisoned status would result in the poison being strengthened (damage increase plus and turn extension).
Other than its effect as a normal weapon, by piercing the ground as an origin point with an arrow it is also possible to turn the surroundings into a poisoned space dyed with yew poison.
