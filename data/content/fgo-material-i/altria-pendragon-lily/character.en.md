### Personality

An Artoria that has pulled the Sword of Selection and began walking the path to kingship. A what-if.
Honest, positive, does everything with utmost effort.
Her being a rather unconfident late bloomer since she’s aware that she’s still half-baked is the fly in the ointment.
Pleasantly happy and joyful when having fun,
saying straightforwardly that sad things are sad, the shape of a young girl that wasn’t allowed to the original Artoria.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

With a “Since I was called as a Heroic Spirit I’ll serve Master with all my strength!”, she expresses motivation and joy through her whole body.
She trusts her Master and doesn’t hesitate if she thinks the fight is good. She doesn’t think at all about a reward for herself.

### Dialogue Examples

『Nice to meet you, Master. Since I’m still a half-baked knight, please call me Saber Lily. From now on, thanks for your continued support.』
『I-is that so…… I think that A rank is an exaggeration… But, I’m happy with flattery. When Master says that, my self-confidence springs out!』
『Master is still growing too. I’m glad to somehow have made a friend. Fufu. It’s a competition about who will become an adult first.』
『And ―― This holy sword (sword) shines to protect the loved ones! Ready your sword, Heroine Z……! Saber Lily will lead you to death!』

### Role within the Game

The appearance of Artoria after pulling the Sword of Selection and just having begun walking the path as a king. Still a half-baked knight girl.
That appearance is like a lovely lily and those eyes are filled with bright hope.
Wandering around the country in order to experience lots of things, she left behind many adventures. Those who were helped by her seemed to praise her as a knight princess for her gorgeousness.

A romantic knight that, in order to become an ideal king, studies every day.
Since she’s still half an adult that can’t sweep away her girlishness, that heart and those dreams are still filled with hope.
The tour round the country with the party consisting on her stepbrother Sir Kay and her retainer, the mage Merlin, usually started with Artoria’s meddling, became a big deal with Merlin’s jeering, and ended with Kay wiping her buttocks.

The leading Servant of the special event 『Saber Wars』.
Having set up the 『alliance of undeveloped Noble Phantasms』 with Mash, she admirably devoted herself to practice in order to raise the power of her Noble Phantasm.
Studying under the mysterious Servant that called herself Saber among Sabers, Heroine X, she fought fierce battles against the strange Servants that kept attacking one after another.
What about the Artorium? What about the Servant Universe? What about Heroine X’s hidden goal?
Saber Lily’s fight has just begun! To Be Continued! (※ This has absolutely nothing to do with the Arthurian cycle)
