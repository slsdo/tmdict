Caliburn.
Originally a sword to select the king. The 『Anti-Unit』 of Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm isn’t aimed to the enemy, but to the current owner.
When that proprietor is corrected and completed as a king, its power will become suitable for a holy sword.
Despite being inferior to Excalibur, this holy sword also converts the user’s mana into heat values, releasing it as particles of light.
