It’s a basic rule of evolutionary designs that equipment and decorations become more luxurious, but there are also some characters like Lily that become more lightly dressed.
Although I liked Lily’s design from the start, I liked even more fully the mini-skirt dress of the third Ascension. (Takeuchi Takashi)
