### Magical Resistance: B

Nullifies spells that have a chant of three verses or below. Receives almost no damage even against Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.

### Riding: A

One is able to operate all vehicles and beasts freely except for those with a Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast ranking.

### Divinity: B
Although Altera herself has no blood relations with a Divine Spirit, the fact that she crushed the European world was treated as a show of God’s might, to the point that she was called Flagellum Dei, the “Scourge of God” in fear and awe. That is why Altera, who became a Heroic Spirit upon the earth, came to possess a high rank in Divinity.

### Civilization Erosure: EX

A subconsciously active skill of the heroic spirit Altera. Anything within her grasp is transformed into its “best” form currently most suited for herself.
This is based on Altera’s own perspective, not necessarily reflecting the object at its greatest or most excellent.
