Photon Ray. An unknown Noble Phantasm.

It is believed to be formed from a combination of the prowess and terror that led to her being feared as the “Scourge of God”, as well as the anecdote about her obtaining the sword of Mars.

Her Noble Phantasm is shaped like a longsword, but appears to be a rather futuristic design. The ‘blade’, formed of tri-colored brands of light, is said to be capable of destroying any existence upon the earth.

By releasing its true name, the ‘blade’ emits rainbow-like magical light and, charging forth like a meteor, Altera brings wide-range annihilation to the enemy formation.

When its true power is unleashed, its rank and type as a Noble Phantasm increase.
