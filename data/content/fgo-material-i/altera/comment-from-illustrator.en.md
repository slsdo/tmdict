Ms. Altera somewhat regrets that she turned into this difficult design where it was hard to put in and depict her having a fighting spirit. Although I received the orders regarding her, there are also many of them that I have not been able to remember by now since the last 2 years or so, but there are very amazing things that were written into this setting, huh? What is going on in this? It is a feeling in that vein. That settingâ€¦ is it not shown yet? I honestly want to see! (huke)
