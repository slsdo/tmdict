### Innate Fitness: D

Born with a body that is perfected as a life form, she can temporarily increase the rank of her STR.
As well, her base design (body shape) never changes regardless of her calorie intake.

### Crest of the Star: EX

The unique pattern imprinted on Altera’s body, a strange design that does not belong to the Huns but resulted from some advanced ritual.
The higher the rank, the higher one’s attack power is increased. By expending mana through it, one can temporarily enhance the performance of any desired part of the body. An efficient skill that costs little mana but lacks the explosiveness of skills like Power Burst. In addition, this unique skill also has the effects of the Instinct skill.
Although, to Altera, it felt like the skill was missing something.

### Military Tactics: B

An instinctive capacity for utilizing tactical knowledge in battlefields where a large number of people are mobilized. A bonus modifier is provided at the time of using one’s own Anti-Army Noble Phantasm or when dealing with an opposing Anti-Army Noble Phantasm.
