### Personality

With her excellent instincts, she can deal with even the drastic of circumstances without abandoning her reason – a proud and logical fighter. However, there is a sort of ‘emptiness’ about her.

Regardless of friend or foe, she has some magnanimity for those warriors whose skill (performance) she has acknowledged, but those who stand against her are treated as only obstructions to be removed, and she is fundamentally merciless. There is no hesitation in her blade. In battle, she can coolly and correctly grasp the situation, becoming a merciless killing machine.

Although she recognizes combat as where she is truly in her element, she personally does not like it. She fights because she is a fighter. In the name of the violent and unchained God of War, she kills all who stands in her way and destroys all ‘civilization’ before her, nothing more. She is unused and inexperienced in matters outside of war and combat.

She was born with a fondness for the God of War, Mars (Ares). She would call him “Marc” though she did not enforce this on others. It was just something she preferred.

In truth, she dislikes her more common name of “Attila”. She does not dislike its meaning – ‘father’ or ‘controller’ – but rather its sound, and is somewhat more attached the German “Etzel”. She calls herself “Altera” and wishes to be known as such, but it is difficult to have her explain the reason. Only to the very small number of people she trusts will she quietly disclose the truth – because it does not sound charming or sweet.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She treats her Master stoically, recognizing them as a general or adviser-like figure, and will generally go along with anything they say with an “I see”. Instead of trusting as a human being, the situation is closer to a fighting machine on the battlefield that fully relies on external software (the Master) to process thoughts.

Her wish for the Holy Grail is ‘to live a life not as a warrior’. She does not despise the life that she spent fighting, but she is interested to find out how she would have lived otherwise.

### Dialogue Examples

“My name is Altera. I am a warrior of the God of War and a descendant of the Xiongnu.”
“I will demolish that civilization.”
“If the Holy Grail serves as a vessel that records everything, then I… will simply destroy it.”
“I will destroy. And I will triumph. Up to now. As well as after this.”
“If I remember correctly, I am also a person called… Attila… Personally, I am not very happy about that. The reason? The reason is… I do not know how to say it. Eventually, there may even be a reason that I can speak of, but as of right now, it is just unpleasant.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Attila the Hun was the overlord who established a great empire in the 5th century.
She was a warrior and king of the Huns, the descendants of the Xiongnu.
Leading an army of cavalry, the conquests of this great hero covered a great part of the map, from Western Asia to Russia, Eastern Europe, and even Gaul. It is said that this was one of the causes for the eventual downfall of the Roman Empire.
Throughout her life, she was always in the midst of battle.
Due to the terrifying acts she committed in war, she was greatly feared in all European nations as the “Scourge of God”.
She is a pure “King of War”. In contrast with her martial achievements, she did not succeed politically, and her empire rapidly fell apart and dissolved after her death. However, the awe and dread infused in the name “Attila” remains in the memories of people to this day.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She was an avatar of destruction. An engine of war that scythed down the many lives who had stood in her path. That was how she had been made to be… so the elders of the Huns had said to her. That she, Altera, existed for battle.
That she had no father, no mother. That she had been “discovered” by the Huns, descendants of the Xiongnu people. Yes, she had no memories of parents, nor of friends, nor of a family. Instead, the world was filled with enemies.
As shown by the marks of war carved into her flesh from the beginning, she lived only to fight. It was her born nature and her role. It was her purpose to exercise her capabilities as intended, and she never held any doubt on the matter.

Becoming destruction itself, she fought like a raging tempest, king of the Huns yet not one of them.
It barely even registered to her that she had armies at her back as she swung her sword with single mind.
Destruction. Domination. Invasion.
She could not be sated, even as the lands of the Huns grew beyond their ability to control. She merely swung the sword and continued the slaughter. Even in the moment when death came to her, she recalled – as she laid in a pool of her own blood, she had thought only of ways to fell Rome.

However, having become a heroic spirit and taken form as a Servant, she began silently questioning herself. Had she perhaps been too much of a warrior? What if she had not become the embodiment of destruction itself? What if she never gripped the sword of the war god?

She had been feared by Europe as the punishment brought down by their absolute deity, the very whip of God Himself. She had been a fighting machine. History had even forgotten that she was a woman. What life could she have lived, if not as a warrior?

What would she have spent her time on?
Would she have been a traveler, freely circling the world on the back of her horse?
Would she have been a grower of life, tilling the earth as she had seen the people of Europe done?
Would she be baking bread in a smoldering oven? Hunting birds and beasts in the wild?
Would she be learning words and language, and writing it down in books?
Would she, with reddened cheeks and gentle smile, have pressed herself into the breast of another?

She did not know. But she wondered…

### Connections with Characters

#### Other Servants

All civilization must be destroyed. There is no difference between them.

#### Caster Servants

Although she witnessed the work of curses in life, as she herself had few ties with magecraft, she holds some actual interest in those pure Casters who practice magecraft.
