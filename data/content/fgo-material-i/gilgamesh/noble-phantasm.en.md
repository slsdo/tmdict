Enuma Elish.
Time and space severance by means of Ea, the Sword of Separation.
The dislocation of the wind pressure, compressed and clashing inwardly, turns into a pseudo space-time dislocation, pulverizing everything which stands to oppose it.
Its attack value cannot be defended against without using an anti-purge{{n2}} armor class or counterbalancing it using damage of the same level.
While the Sword of Separation, Ea, is categorized as a sword, in itself it is close to that of a staff. Its three lithograph each represents heaven, earth, and underworld; They each rotate to a different direction, which represents how the world is. All three together represents the universe.
Possessing output that equal to or even greater than Artoria’s Excalbur, it is the sword that “tears the world.”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Post interlude, it’s EX. SOmetimes GO mats gives out ranks depending on ingame rank and not actual rank.
2. {{note2}} Fun thing I found. I had always thought it to be 粛清 (shukusei), which means (political) purge, but it apparently is 粛正 (shukusei), which means enforcement. They are both political terms. The difference would be, 粛清 is the desire to make disappear not only things that are unjust and impure, but also EVERYTHING that stands in your way. Basically, press ctrl+delete on anyone that is a nuisance for you.
Whereas 粛正, the terms being used for Enuma Elish here, is the desire to remove all that is unjust and impure, and then returns to proper form. Basically, use ctrl+find then replace things that are bad with better things.
I feel like this is important, because this strengthen the image that Enuma Elish is not an attack that only pulverizes, but also sorta drive home the concept that Enuma Elish was also an attack that rebuilds, which ties in to how Ea (drill) is the power used by Ea (god) to separate heaven and earth from its chaotic state and then builds bunch of cool things, like human civilization and stuffs.
Technically, both is still purge if you squint at it the right way. Just that the one used here has a more positive connotation.
