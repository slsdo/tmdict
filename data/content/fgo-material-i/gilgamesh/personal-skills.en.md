### Charisma: A+

The ability to lead and command large armies.
At this point, it is no longer popularity, but a type of curse instead.

### Golden Rule: A

Not a golden proportion of the body, but the fate of how much wealth follows him around in life.
He can do even multi-millionaire, goldy style. Has no money troubles for the entirety of his lives.

### Collector: EX

The ability to acquire and manage items of high quality.
EX means outside the standard, but in Gilgamesh case, already various treasures are counted inside his vault in the state of “what is yours belongs to me”.{{n1}}
There are also cases where, if he were presented with a target treasure, he would discover from his fault the “original” that became its basis and relabel it.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} It’s a Doraemon joke, in case you didn’t get it. Gilgamesh, mankind’s oldest Jaian.
  To note, this is also the skill that basically is responsible for GoB treasure paradox
