The deuteragonist of Kara no Kyoukai. You know who he is.
For normal people, he’s a gentle but otherwise unassuming young man. However, for those walking outside the human path, his impossible normality can become a fatal toxin. This nature is in full display in Adventures, as the shock of meeting him was enough to split Yukinobu’s head into 17 pieces. PS: The hardcore fans may have noticed it, but the Shiki that Yakou Yukinobu saw there was SHIKI. Yukinobu himself had subconsciously noticed that, which is why his narration of the moment consistently described Ryougi as “the high schooler” instead of “her.”
During my research trip for *The Adventures of Lord El-Melloi II*, I rechecked the chronology of the events between the end of Kara no Kyoukai and Future Gospel. The essential thing I wanted to verify was who owned Aozaki Touko’s office, Garan no Dou, and the answer was that the owner at the time was Mizuhara Maayu. It’s only a little while after this that a young man stumbled into place and ended up publishing a fairy tale book.
