Commonly nicknamed “The Titan’s Cellar.”
An association of alchemists located in the Atlas Mountains, Egypt. The institute of aggregation and measurement.
They were originally one of the three major divisions of the Mage’s Association, but they are less a group of mages and more a group of superpowered individuals who treat their bodies as man-machines.

However, one group of families called The Six Sources of Atlas possess special cells that produce magical energy that functions only within their bodies. These abilities called Traditional Features are mere checkpoints toward Atlas’s goal but the families internally develop them in order to awaken the abilities of their bodies. The Etherlight of the Eltnam family, for example, was initially developed as pseudo-nerves for medical purposes and eventually reached the point where people can use them without necessarily being an Eltnam, although with some functions restricted (it’s still a fact that only the family can use it to its true potential). Additionally, Sion Eltnam Sokaris has a power named Transparent Body, but you’ll have to read the story to understand just how compatible with Etherlight that makes her.
Oh, “why do only the members of the Six Sources have these cells?”, you ask? See, the Atlas Institute began with…
