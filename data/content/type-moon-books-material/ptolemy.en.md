A past hero you may know from Case Files, cheating his way into making an appearance.
He was a vassal of Iskandar and one of the very few winners in the Wars of the Diadochi. The founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt.
He was illustrated by Sakamoto Mineji but originally designed by Morii Shizuki, tying in with how Morii drew him for Case Files Materials.
As alluded to in-story, he is the kind of Servant that had two golden ages in life, so his best Noble Phantasm differs depending on if he’s in his younger or older days. The Noble Phantasm of his younger days is [Pharos Tis Alexandreias]{Eternal light unknown to the moon}. It’s the mirror that served as the vital point of the Pharos Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. This mirror that converts all forms of energy into powerful light and heat is something Ptolemy obtained during his expeditions with Iskandar.
