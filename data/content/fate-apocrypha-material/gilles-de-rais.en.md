The man who went on a rampage as a character in *Fate/Zero*, and whose unexpected reappearance shocked everyone, even myself. As everyone already knows, he is the man known as Blue Beard, Gilles de Rais.
In this work, he appears as a Servant… or rather, as a guest character to break Ruler’s heart.
However, since Shakespeare summoned the true Gilles, he changed sides after being persuaded by Ruler. Though Gilles de Rais is someone suited for breaking Ruler’s heart, he is the least suitable person to turn into Ruler’s enemy. Shakespeare knew that risk and yet still enthusiastically wrote the script that way “because it seemed interesting” to him. This is what you would call reaping what you sow.
