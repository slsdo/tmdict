The dean of the Department of Summoning. The Department of Summoning is a subordinate organization to the Department of Spiritual Evocation, which ended up being regarded very highly only in the *Fate/Apocrypha* world. As you all already know, subspecies Holy Grail Wars are held all over the place in the *Apo* world, so the Mage’s Association had to quickly form countermeasures. At first, every magecraft department even slightly linked to Servant summoning techniques were scrambling to reap the benefits before each other, causing ugly conflicts to continue even after a Holy Grail War ended, so it was decided to treat “everything related to Servants of the Holy Grail War” under the category of “summoning,” entrusting all responsibility to an assured conservative in the Association.
That conservative is this old man, Rocco Belfeban. Status-wise, he is effectively a “proxy Lord.” Of course, since there is a conservative faction, there is also a reformist faction, and they strongly recommended Lord El Melloi II, who survived the largest-scale subspecies Holy Grail War in history, for the position instead. (However, the El Melloi clan’s stance is conservative, and El Melloi II’s own position is neither conservative nor reformist, maintaining a complicatedly neutral stance.)
Fortunately, both of them are well aware of the threat of subspecies Holy Grail Wars, and their views match in that they prioritize resolving the situation over the gains for their respective factions.
Rocco is a collection maniac, and yet by contrast is quite sloppy with what he collects. He’s the type to be completely neglectful by using Mystic Codes that activate just by having them on hand. He has stated in quite a carefree manner, “It’s fine as long as I have just Mystic Codes that resist against curses.” No, it’s not fine. He doesn’t involve himself much with the students, so there are lots of rumors like “The old man’s private room is becoming more and more of an entirely different world every year” about him.
