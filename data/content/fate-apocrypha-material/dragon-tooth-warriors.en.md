An army of small-fry who fight using pure numbers. Originally, making warriors using dragon teeth is a form of magecraft that comes from Greece, but a magus of Semiramis’ level is able to use it of her region of origin or personal style of magecraft. This time, they were used as rank-and-file soldiers to defend the Hanging Gardens, with even flying types appearing, but sadly, they are still small-fry… As such, they were easily blown apart with one blow of Astolfo’s magic flute.
