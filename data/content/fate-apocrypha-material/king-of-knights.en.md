Her true name is Arturia Pendragon, otherwise known as King Arthur. The billboard character of *Fate*, the original Saber-san who boasts the highest popularity no matter how many times the Saber archetype has been ridiculed, and a cold father. There is no need to give an explanation on her at his point; rather, I think those who would need an explanation wouldn’t be reading this Material book, but what can I say?
Even though she is a character that definitely has to appear in the flashback of Mordred’s past, I was super tense just showing her backside in one of the third volume’s illustrations.
