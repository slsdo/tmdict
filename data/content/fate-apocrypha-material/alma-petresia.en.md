A Christian sister who works at the church under the authority of the Holy Church in Trifas. She is completely unrelated to the Church’s Executors or the Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, and was merely ordered, “For now, watch over the situation of this town.” She never investigated matters unnecessarily, simply ignoring the existence of the magi in town and passing several decades there in an unconcerned manner.
Naturally, she isn’t able to get excited and passionate at her age… Just when she thought that, she received a shock from the girl who appeared before her suddenly. When Alma first saw her, she realized with a glance that she was the esteemed saint Jeanne d’Arc and almost fainted.
