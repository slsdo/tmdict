A “Red” Master. His nickname is Silver Lizard. Just like the other “Red” Masters such as Gene Ram and the Pentel Brothers, he has fought both together and against Shishigou at various times in the past. He is obsessed with animals, particularly lizards, and the skin on almost all his vital spots besides his face are covered with silver scales.
He and the others were given such individualistic settings, but they were all completely defeated with Semi-sama’s attack of “Now, now, have a cup of tea.”
