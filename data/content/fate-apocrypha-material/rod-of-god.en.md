An enchanted weaponâ€¦ or not. It is actually a new weapon created by modern science. It is a simple yet deep space-born weapon that consists of dropping big, long and heavy metal rods from space and destroying targets with their kinetic energy.
Of course, it is considered a far off idea since there is the issue of the rods burning up in the atmosphere, and it is nothing more than idle gossip. Well, if Ruler threw her holy flag from space with all her might, it might create an approximately similar amount of kinetic energy, though.
