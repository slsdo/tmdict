O Sun, Abide to Death. The Anti-Divine Noble Phantasm of Lancer of “Red,” Karna. A god-killing spear given to him by the thunder god Indra in the *Mahabharata*. The secret weapons among secret weapons, which doesn’t exist even in the treasure vault of the King of Heroes. Just as shown in the illustrations within *Complete Material IV*, his spear transforms and officially becomes this Noble Phantasm after he sheds his golden armor.
It’s not like the spear he usually uses is a fake, but it can’t activate its name of “Vasavi Shakti: O Sun, Abide to Death” in this state.
