When I first started writing these characters, I came up with freelance magi under the theme of “joined”… in other words, conjoined twins… actually, characters like the resistance leader Kuato who appeared in *Total Recall* (the 1990 version), but the “Red” Masters basically didn’t need to be written in such detail, so I quickly moved it to the discarded ideas pile.
Just like Zugzwang (the magus clan that appeared in the short story that was published in TYPE-MOON Ace), they are the type of magi who divided up their family’s Magic Crest between themselves and display greater power when near each other. “We are 1+1=200…!” Well, these types generally end up disputing with each other as siblings or leave themselves unguarded and die, though.
