The name of a real place. It is a Romanian provincial city to the northwest of the capital Bucharest, and it is where Vlad Tepes…Vlad III’s parental home is preserved. It has a long and old history, having been formed primarily as part of colonization from Germany in the 12th century. The old town district in particular is a precious place where buildings from the Middle Ages still remain as they were in the past.
Trifas was conceived using this city as a model, while also made so as not to be eye-catching as a tourist attraction in comparison.
