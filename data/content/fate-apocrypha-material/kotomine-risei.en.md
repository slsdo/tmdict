The person that the Holy Church dispatched to the Holy Grail War during the Third War in Fuyuki. He was assigned as the moderator of the war. However, the Greater Grail was stolen during the Third War, and despite being the moderator he reluctantly intervened into the situation and rescued the Master of the Tohsaka, who he was friends with. In the midst of that, the Einzbern Servant, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, helped him with his rescue work.
As thanks, Risei prepared a family register for him after he gained a flesh body, registering him as his son “Kotomine Shirou.”
He entered the Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament as Kotomine Shirou, but naturally Risei couldn’t acknowledge him as his son there and approached him honestly as a friend. Around the time when Risei’s son Kirei was born, Shirou had deliberately diminished his contact with Risei.
Since there was no fear of a Fourth Holy Grail War, Risei appeared to have been able to live somewhat longer here, but he has already died from disease before the start of the *Apocrypha* novels. His funeral was the last time that his son Kirei and Shirou met.
