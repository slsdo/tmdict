Holy Mother of Dissection. The Noble Phantasm of Assassin of “Black,” Jack the Ripper. It is a Noble Phantasm that has sublimated the Jack the Ripper murders as a concept, of a somewhat different nature than normal assassination-type Noble Phantasms. By fulfilling three conditions when activating the Noble Phantasm, its power is doubled. First condition: the target is female (including female animals as well). Second condition: there is fog out. Third condition: it is night. In a Holy Grail War, it is relatively easy to fulfill all but the first of these conditions, so in that regard it can be considered an easy to use Noble Phantasm.
And when this is combined with Jack’s skill “Information Erasure,” she can act more than sufficiently as a member of the Assassin class.
However, though her Noble Phantasm’s power is great, its damage is determined by the target’s resistance to curses. It is difficult for “Maria the Ripper” to deal its full power just as planned against enemies, except for modern day Heroic Spirits. Only if she has a Master that is the best in terms of magecraft and all three conditions are fulfilled can this Noble Phantasm have power equal to the average “Zabaniya” used by the Hassans.
