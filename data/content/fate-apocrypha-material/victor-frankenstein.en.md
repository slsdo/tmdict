The creator, or perhaps parent, of Berserker of “Black,” Frankenstein. In the light novel, he appears as a real historical person. He was a scientist and alchemist. Like Caster of “Black,” he aimed to create Adam and Eve. He differs from Caster in that he didn’t see the creation of Adam and Eve as the gateway to Eden, but rather simply wanted to create a being as close to God as possible.
Eve was born defective—at the very least, that was how Frankenstein saw her. An artificial life-form that does not have emotions was, to him, equivalent to a badly made living creature.
He doesn’t get it, he really doesn’t get it, this guy.
