The greatest rival of Rider of “Red,” Achilles, during his lifetime. He was the strongest hero on the side of Troy during the Trojan War. Also, his younger brother Paris is the perpetrator who caused the Trojan War to happen.
He is the exact opposite of Achilles as a hero, a bearded middle-age man who likes to play the fool. He refers to himself as “mister” (old man) in his speech, and always fights on the battlefield with an easygoing attitude.
He’s ruthless, but not cruel; skilled, yet not gifted. He faced other famous heroes besides Achilles, without retreating a single step… or not; rather, he would often retreat two or three steps and then strike the enemy when their guard’s down, before running away again, and just when they think he’s far away, he throws mud at them; a-anyway, he prided himself at being the strongest when it comes to siege battles.
He uses dual long-sword/throwing spear called Durindana, and by throwing it he managed to pierce through six of the barriers of “Rho Aias: Seven Rings that Cover the Fiery Heavens,” which boasts the greatest rank of toughness against projectiles.
In order to settle things once and for all with him, Achilles challenged him to a sink-or-swim duel, where he temporarily gave up his immortality. Unable to resist the temptation of getting the chance to take Achilles’ life, Hector accepted the one-on-one duel and was defeated by a paper-thin difference in skill.
To Achilles, Hector is one of the top three people he never wants to fight again, whether it is before or after his death. The remaining two are Penthesilea and Chiron.
