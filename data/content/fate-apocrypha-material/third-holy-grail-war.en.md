The third occurrence of the Holy Grail War held in Fuyuki. It was the war where, capitalizing on the history of shared failure during the First and Second Wars, a mediator was sent from the Holy Church, forming the current Fuyuki-style Holy Grail War format.
The timelines of this light novel series *Fate/Apocrypha* and the original visual novel *Fate/stay night* diverge at this point. In other words, history changes according to whether the Einzberns choose Avenger or Ruler as their Servant. In the former case, the Greater Grail ends up being contaminated, causing a great disaster in the Fourth War and the Holy Grail being destroyed or shut down in the Fifth War, while in the latter case, the Greater Grail isnâ€™t contaminated, but in exchange, it is stolen away by Darnic.
Oh dear, the Einzberns really are checkmated at all sides.
