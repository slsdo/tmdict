Reihō Fumidaku Meifu no Fuigo.
The same thing as Ishtar’s Noble Phantasm, An Gal Tā Kigal Shē. However this isn’t shot from the great heavens towards the great land, it’s a crushing blow of the Underworld’s mistress from the bottom of the earth to the adjoining land.
An earth impact that demolishes Mt. Ebih through earthquakes and deformation of the Earth’s crust.
It falls behind Ishtar’s Venus blaster in power, but the essence of this Noble Phantasm is 『making the terrain the Underworld』.
To Ereshkigal, who has an immense authority over the Underworld, to her and those fighting with her, to all those it gives a strong protection.

Although it’s another story, the Noble Phantasm’s sequence is:

01. Mt. Ebih is extended in the background behind the scene, but before (at the scene’s front) Ereshkigal advances elegantly with a model walk (as in a dot-like side-scroll game).
The mountain range is large, Ereshkigal is small.
02. Ereshkigal’s journey continues. Ereshkigal becomes gradually (or in about three steps, like a picture story show) becomes larger than the mountains.
The image of the size contrast of the nature that was like a picture behind the scene, and of the individual (god) at the front getting inverted.
03. Ereshkigal, who has become larger than Mt. Ebih, violently thrusts her spear into the center of the mountain range.
04. The mountain range erupts with death agony, a great earthquake is caused. A geyser of magma rises in the scene’s front, damage.
※ Actually she didn’t become bigger, at the end of the day it’s a metaphor of 『she broke the range』. Therefore when destroying the mountain, it’s fine not to think about the display of the enemy. The subject is 『the mountain and the goddess』.

Although that’s how it was, it’s not a Noble Phantasm that recreates a myth, but was modified to something with the last scene of Chapter 7 as a motif using Meslamtaea.
