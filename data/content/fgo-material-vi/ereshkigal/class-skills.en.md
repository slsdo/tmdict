### Magic Resistance: D

Invalidates magecraft with a rank lower than D.
With death having become a daily routine due to being immersed in the Underworld’s gloom, her Magic Resistance has remarkably decreased.

### Territory Creation: A+

Freely calls the Seven Gates of the Underworld.
The place in which Ereshkigal stands becomes the Underworld in which death easily conducts itself.

### Divine Core of the Goddess: B

A skill that expresses that she’s a perfected goddess since birth.
Is endowed with the effect of preserving the absoluteness of mind and body. Mitigates most mental interference, and the body shape doesn’t change due to growth or no matter how many calories are ingested.
A compound skill comprising Divinity as well.
Since she is a Pseudo-Servant, the rank stops at B.
