### Gift of the Starman: B

A skill acquired after becoming Santa Claus.
Giving presents, enriching the heart.
Although Altera wants to give presents, she can’t quite grasp the desire of others, and also because of her reserved personality, the skill rank is lower than Santa Alter (Artoria).
Santa Alter has 『Gift of the Saint』, but in Altera’s case, it’s changed for some reason to 『Gift of the Starman』.

### Natural Body: D

Having become a Heroic Spirit of Christmas, since she can’t regulate her body temperature properly due to having the concept of winter added, it has unfortunately been lost.
(Not used in 『FateGO』)

### Sugar Sculpture of Rainbow: B

The star attached to the Christmas tree’s top is called the Star of Bethlehem, and symbolizes the birth of the Messiah.
It is said that those struck by Altera Santa’s cane with a clunk will be given great blessings and favors. A minimum version of Merlin’s 『Hero Creation』. It’s Christmas, this much of a cheat is allowed!

### Crest of the Twinkling Star: EX

A skill that has changed due to the fusion of the unique patterns carved on Altera’s body and the concept of Christmas.
Through this strong blessing power, Altera-san awakens the potential engraved on her Saint Graph, and can act as Altera Santa for just three minutes on Earth!
A super power-up for 3 turns. After 3 turns, stun.
