Candy Star Photon Ray.
A new Noble Phantasm devised by having transformed the Sword of the War God that Altera has into a candy cane.
Photon Ray is now Photon Ram.
Please enjoy the splendid Itano Circus by Altera’s subordinate sheep.{{n1}}
In secret, it’s viewed as the rival to Caster of Okeanos’ Noble Phantasm · Pig Great Parade, but that’s for another episode.

Far away from the stone chamber.
Without connecting memories or records,
even if that huge solitude is still not healed.
The sheep she sees in her dreams span the night sky as a rainbow.
