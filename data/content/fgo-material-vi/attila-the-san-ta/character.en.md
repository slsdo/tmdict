### Personality

In order to infer whether Christmas, in which presents are given, is a good civilization or a bad civilization, she assumed the role of Santa Claus.
Saint Graph-wise she’s Altera, but since she has a slight fever, her judgment is weaker than usual, and it’s become easier to give her instructions.
One wonders if it’s fine to say the prettiness · loveliness of her appearance has increased.
Due to (thanks to) the fever, her Destroy-Civilization-Meter has been remarkably lowered.
The usual Altera is 90% character as a warrior, and 10% character as a girl,
but Altera Santa has become 40% character as a warrior, and 60% character as a girl.
Altera’s base is girlish and romantic, so she’s happy and excited about being entrusted the role of Santa Claus.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She sees Master as a reliable partner or a beautiful sheep, and calls them 『Fluffy Master』.
She tells herself that she’s Santa Claus before Altera, so her demeanor · responses are softer than usual.
That, combined with Altera’s honor student character of『doing things with all her power』, resulted into a strange behavior.
How much she knows and how much she doesn’t know can’t be grasped, but in order to make Christmas succeed, and to deliver an 『important gift』 from a shining sheep, she straightforwardly relies on the Master.
Her special technique is an imitation of Elder Santa Claus.
※ Elder Santa Claus is a lifeform from Altera’s imagination.

### Dialogue Examples

「I’m Altera. The great warrior and king of the Huns.
… As you can see, I am Santa. I’m Santa」

「Wait, now I’ll become a perfect Santa」
Here she puts on a false mustache with a rustling,
「Hohoho. I’m Santa」

「There’s only one problem. That this outfit is a bit cold.
It’s not a change from the usual? That shouldn’t be… It’s a bit cold」

「I know. It’d be fine to distribute presents, wouldn’t it?
But there is only one day. What a problem. Can one person distribute presents to children all over the world…?」

「――― I understand. Christmas is a warm civilization」

### Role within the Game

Look to the skies.
If you’re one to pray to the night sky you should see it.
The lonely rainbow dashing through the night sky.
The flock of sheep crying meeh, meeh.
And with her body wrapped in daring garments,
with a little feeling of having a cold, the figure of a beautiful Santa…!
Her name is Altera the San(ta).
The great king of the West, the sword princess possessing the Crest of the Star has awakened from an eventful fate
with a duty and motivation as Santa Claus.
This time she’s accompanied by many nomad and equestrian soldiers from her anecdote as a great king. …Though, they all have become lovely sheep (although in a spacial way). Why is that.

<>

Her too healthy body and her too sound mind, as well as her a bit ignorant… Nay, innocent character gave her a unique opportunity.
When the Chaldea staff fell victim to a mysterious fever, Altera the Santa, as the only 『Servant able to move』, got on the back of the famous sheep Zerco and flew away for the sake of peace in Chaldea and Christmas.
For Altera, who wanted to ascertain the civilization of Christmas for a long time, this role was what she wanted. Changing into showy Santa clothes, she dove into the sky of the Underworld.
Her only insecurity is the chill of the Santa clothes.
「Compared to the usual clothes, the area isn’t that small…?」, Altera Santa tilts her head.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} It’s written as フンヌ and ヒュンヌ between brackets, but there’s no alternative writing for “Hun” in English as far as I know. Also, Xiongnu aren’t exactly the same as Huns, but they’re associated with them.
2. {{note2}} Obvious reference to Padoru memes.
3. {{note3}} Just in case, she means Dumuzid. The ジ of ドゥムジ can be read as either “ji” (similar to G) or “zi”.
