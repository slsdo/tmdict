### Magic Resistance: C

Invalidates magecraft with an aria of three verses or lower.
Even if it’s a High-Thaumaturgy · Greater Ritual, she barely receives any damage. [2]
Since she sometimes can’t refute any claim of 『It’s different from the present I wished』 due to her natural kindness, her resistance to magical energy is lower than when she was a Saber.

### Riding: EX

Chosen as a Heroic Spirit of Christmas, and engulfed by the quiet flames of a sense of duty, Altera has greatly improved · transformed her Riding skill.
Concretely, she has become a sheep master.
The figure running not on a famous horse, but on the famous sheep Zerco, is associated with that of the strongest king of the nomadic and equestrian tribe of the Huns who ran about the Western world… is it… associated?

### Civilization Erosion: EX

A skill that is unconsciously activated by the Heroic Spirit Altera.
It transmutes whatever she has in her hand into the best attributes for her current self.
『The best』 doesn’t mean 『the most excellent』, but refers to the current obsession of Altera herself. It’s not necessary to say what Altera’s current obsession this time is.
Originally, the horses that should have been taken along as horses have all turned into sheep (kind of), and conversely her beloved sword Sword of the War God has been modified into the Cane (staff) of the War God. Amazing.

### Divinity: B

Existence of aptitude as a Divine Spirit.
Altera herself has no biological relationship with a Divine Spirit, but the fact of she trampling the European World was considered God’s authority, and being subject of awe resulted in her obtaining the two names of 『Punishment of God』 『Whip of God』. From those things, Altera, who became a Heroic Spirit on earth, possesses a high rank of Divine Spirit aptitude.
