I tried to design her in a cutely grotesque style for her three stages where they have the look that the things that have been wrapped up would momentarily swell up before they would burst open. The butterflies and ribbons represent lost souls, and they are of the impression that they are closely coiling around Abby-chanâ€™s surroundings. The butterflies will become moths as her Foreigner level rises during her last Ascension. (Kuroboshi Kouhaku)
