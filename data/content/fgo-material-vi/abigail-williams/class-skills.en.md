### Existence Outside of the Domain: EX

Denotes a being that descended from the void of outer space.

Possessed by an evil god, Abigail houses a portent of the god’s Authority within herself and wields it.

### Insanity: B

Anxiety and fear. Deviations from harmony and providence. A heterogeneous thinking that exerts an influence even on the worldviews within the mentality of the people in one’s surroundings.

### Divinity: B

Having become the “Gate” for a higher-order existence lurking in outer space, Abigail is tinged with a strong divinity. An immeasurable threat that can even rewrite the image of the world. But as compensation, that Insanity cannot be removed.
