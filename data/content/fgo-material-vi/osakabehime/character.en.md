### Personality

It all sounds fine when you call her gloomy, or shy or quiet. But in reality she’s simply a hardcore shut-in who can’t be bothered to talk or even breath.
And yet, she still carries some self-hatred due to how lonely she tends to make herself.

She’s lazy and undisciplined. The kind that won’t even clean her room.
But she’s pretty passionate about working on doujinshi and is devoted to always look for new material (wickedly).

### Attitude towards Master

It depends.
If her Master likes flirty girls, she acts spoiled.
If her Master is arrogant, she acts cruelly.
As their bond deepens, she’ll eventually show her true self to them.

Still, she’s aware of how she can be a bit troublesome or tiresome to deal with sometimes.

### Dialogue Examples

“Ahh…Ah? Right, I’m the Assassin-class Servant, Osakabehime! Say, can I go home now? I can’t? Oh, I see.”
“Gyahh! Why do I have to give you items even though we’re enemies!? Go away!”
(This is such a drag, I hate this. I have to say it but it’s such a drag that I’m getting dizzy.)

### Historical Image · Character Image

*(written by Morise Ryou)*

Osakabehime (刑部姫) (called Osakabedono (於佐賀部殿) in the “Saikaku Shokaku Banashi” and Osakabe (長壁) in the “Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki”) is a god who came to be deified as the indigenous god of Himeji.

She had lived at Himeji castle for a very long time, but she was then kicked out of the castle by Hideyoshi, then after the battle of Sekigahara, when Ikeda Terumasa became the lord of Himeji Castle, he built a five-story castle tower in 1609 that Osakabehime used to get inside the castle again. Through this course of events, it seems Osakabehime had taken pride in being the true lord of the castle, and despite there supposedly not being anyone up in the tower, you could sometimes see a light in there at night. People in the castle grew afraid of her and called her “Hachitendou-sama”. It was also said that whoever laid eyes upon her would die instantly.

If we were to make an estimate, her true form was that of a female fox who had lived for about 300 years. With her shapeshifting powers, she could change into a young girl wearing a ceremonial kimono, a three meter-tall fierce god, or many other forms. She was an important member of the fox family as she commanded 808 familiars, within which there were a few of them who were noted to be especially strong such as her four heavenly kings: Nikaido no Sususuke, Toriikoshi no Chuusaburou, Kakurekasa no Kinmaru, Niwatorikui no Yamitarou. As well as her lonely warrior: Noarashi no Hananaga.

Osakabehime’s parents were ancient foxes who lived in the Yamato province for a millennium, and during the era of Emperor Kanmu her parents were hunted down to be used as materials for the magical rainmaking tool “Hatsune no Tsuzumi”. Genkurougitsune, who loved his parents and saved Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the then wielder of the “Hatsune no Tsuzumi”, from danger is Osakabehime’s younger brother. (from the joruri play “Yoshitsune Senbonzakura”)

Youkai who lock themselves up in a castle like her are usually referred to as castle ghosts. Another example would be Kamehime of Inawashiro Castle (aka Kamega Castle). By the way Kamehime’s true form is a badger, and in his play “Tenshu Monogatari” the famous author Izumi Kyoka wrote Kamehime and Osakabehime as having a sisterly relationship.

Just like how Kamehime coerced the castle keepers of Inawashiro into always greeting her, Osakabehime who wasn’t very fond of humans also forced the lords of Himeji Castle to greet her once a year. (from the Kasshawa)

### 『FGO』中的人物像

Anyway, her real form may be that of a fox, but after a fierce argument with Tamamo it was decided she would do a job change into a bat.
She uses them as familiars to fight the enemy.

However, she’s still just a shut-in. After all, she had for a very long time enjoyed a shut-in life where she merely left the tasks of castle lord to warriors and she only met with the (temporary) lord of the castle once a year to say hi and give him some random instructions before going back to her room.

After many battles, and many eras, she eventually came to realize she had been left behind alone.

The lords of the castle disappeared; the people who listened to her also disappeared.
At first it was all fun and games for her, but she eventually started thinking that nobody knowing about her anymore would be the same as being dead, and she was spurred on by those thoughts.

She protected Himeji/Hakuro castle from many fierce battles. Even though she knew there was no longer any point to it.
There was nobody left to praise her. There was nobody left to fear her.
Even if there were those who knew she existed, nobody could actually be sure that she was indeed still there.

“……What, so this is the same as being dead, huh.”

At some point, Osakabehime simply disappeared.
And now, after tasting the forbidden fruit known as the internet and doujinshi she has been completely immersing herself in them day and night.

### General Armaments

Origami: Her origami attacks, protects, and moves her.

### Connections with Characters

#### Miyamoto Musashi

…Back when she was having trouble with other youkai who lived in Himeji castle, they all suddenly ran away once Miyamoto Musashi decided to stay in the castle for a while.

Osakabehime "T-Thanks for that…Huh? Wait were they a man, or a woman? Aaaah at any rate they’re scary! The force of their smile is too much!"

#### Minamoto no Yoshitsune

Yoshitsune was the wielder of the rainmaking relic Hatsune no Tsuzumi that was made using her parents. Genkurougitsune followed Yoshitsune out of love for his parents and eventually received the relic from Yoshitsune.

It is said that Genkurougitsune was so moved by this that later on he saved Yoshitsune from danger many times.
And Genkurougitsune is indeed Osakabehime’s little brother.

Osakabehime “Ahhh but having seen Ushiwakamaru in Chaldea I can’t help but feel she did it while thinking something like…‘Well the Minamoto house didn’t need some rainmaking relic, so I gave it to this random fox’…”

(from the joruri ‘Yoshitsune Senbonzakura’)

#### Kiyohime

She met her through Tamamo.
“She may be older than me but I have the upper hand as a princess, there’s nothing to fear!” or so she thought, but she eventually came to know of Kiyohime’s Kiyohime-ness and started going “Kiyohime, so scary…”.

She formed her own doujin group “Princess x2” with her, and they work on doujinshi in many different genres.

#### Tamamo no Mae

They once had this huge argument about how one of them had already called dibs on being the fox character, or whether one of them was the original, etc. and they ended up causing huge trouble and dragging an entire online forum into it. This incident is still the stuff of legend.

After having lost the argument, Osakabehime ended up dropping her fox element and adopted a bat element when being summoned!

Osakabehime "Just looking at her she seems to exude this incredible normie aura, but I also feel like there’s something oddly off about her, like she carries a very unfortunate air around her due to carrying some huge weight on her shoulders～♪ I guess being strong and famous isn’t all that great after all…"

#### Murasaki Shikibu

She feels like she doesn’t stand a chance when faced with a true genius.
Also she feels like their characters overlap!

- Literature
- They’re both gloomy
- Glasses
- Japanese

Pricess check, done!

But still, she does respect her as a fellow author.
