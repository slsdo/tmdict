### Chiyogami Manipulation: EX

She is able to control her origami at will. She can use it to attack, defend herself, and she can even combine it with her Shapeshifting skill to make decoys.
This is her own personal arrangement of the shikigami utilized by practitioners of Onmyoudou.

### Shapeshifting: A+

She possesses the power to shapeshift. In front of other people she appears as a young girl of about 17~18 years of age wearing a ceremonial kimono, but can also turn into a three meter-tall fierce god.
Moreover, despite being so reserved, she possesses a top-class growth aspect within Japanese Servants which even managed to fool Miyamoto Musashi.

### Four Gods Divination (Hakuro): A

A skill based on the story of how the location for Himeji Castle (also called Hakuro Castle) was divinated by four gods.
For a few turns, the surrounding area is treated as her own territory, and thus she gains a stat boost from fame.
Moreover, she can control the boost to her stats to a certain extent by prioritizing certain directions in her territory.
If she concentrates in the north, her END will be prioritized. If east, her STR. If west, her AGI. If south, her MANA.
Both Servants and Masters within the area can benefit from this blessing, but the limit is four people.

### Castle Ghost: A++

The general term used for monsters who migrated from places like shrines to castles. It is even said that Osakabehime was the real master of Himeji Castle.
Rumors say that merely seeing Osakabehime would curse you, and could even kill you instantly.
Sadly her power grows weaker the farther she gets from the castle, but within it she’s extremely powerful.

### Animal Control (Bats): EX

She can control bats, which are neither beasts nor birds, as her familiars.
She’s become highly specialized in bats, and thus she uses them to attack and move, and she never fights by herself. She’s pretty lazy.
Since she’s currently using her origami as main means of attack, her bats are currently taking a break.

### Divinity: C

She was worshiped as the indigenous god of the land of Himeji.
