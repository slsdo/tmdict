Hachitendou-sama of the Hundred Demons of Hakuro Castle.
A grand-scale magecraft that is similar but different to a Reality Marble that manifests a miniature recreation of Himeji castle.
With its majestic beauty, the castle provides mental support to allies.
If Osakabehime herself was more fierce, the castle could unleash fierce attacks upon enemies by itself, but due to her nature as a shut-in it has become a purely defensive Noble Phantasm.

It has a side-effect of inflicting charm upon Japanese Servants, especially those from up to the Edo period, but…This effect isn’t utilized in FGO.
