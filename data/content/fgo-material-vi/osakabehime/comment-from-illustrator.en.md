I was told to draw Osakabehime as a shut-in so I tried to draw her different expressions in a way to make her easy to like; her fragile mentality makes her so cute…I thought too much about her fellow e-mail buddies when deciding on her colors so she ended up naturally looking Halloween-ish. If you ask me, her second stage is her default form, while her third one is basically her best clothes for going out. So if she were to be suddenly called while she was lazying around in her room she’d go to her first stage to hide her appearance since she had no time to prep herself. (Moriyama Daisuke)
