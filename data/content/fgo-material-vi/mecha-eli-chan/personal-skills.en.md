### Innocent Kaiju: EX

An id_es skill that mutated from “Innocent Monster”.
The dragon-girl of iron, Mecha Eli-chan, flies through the sky with the power of special cinematography, breathing fire, leaking electric shocks, and firing missiles. That is truly how a guardian deity of steel should be. She secretly wishes for a theme song to play whenever she uses this skill.

### Overload (Revised): C

A variation of the skill that Frankenstein and Babbage possess. Although it does not increase the power of Noble Phantasms, it increases NP at the cost of HP.
According to the Eliza-resercher, Mr. R: “No matter how you look at it, this is the prelude to self-destruction!”

### Final Eli-chan: C

A defensive field which protects both the world and oneself---
By releasing the Eliza particles covering her body, it reveals her true form and final form.
She looks the same, but her tail is probably super hot.

### Magus 100-Hit Combo: EX

A demonic banquet that summons Mecha Eli-chans as she rides on the mass-production line and has them charge at the enemy target. In the end, over 100 Mecha Eli-chans combine into a giant spear and do something awful against the enemy. In another world view, this is also called “Superhuman Sisters Alliance”. (It is not employed in “FGO”.)
