Breast Zero Erzsébet.
The Ultimate Private Live Show in which Mecha Eli-chan throws all her armaments against a single individual.
A reckless action of taking something originally meant to be used against an army, and using it against a single individual. There is no Face Open.{{n1}}
The Blast Voice at the end looks like a beam weapon, but is actually just noise. It is an after-effect of releasing the maximum output of her internal dragon lung.
By means of spatial compression, said lung possess a spatial reverberation comparable to the Tokyo Dome and can produce a destructive sound wave on the same level as Elizabeth Bathory even without an amplifier such as the Čachtice Castle.
