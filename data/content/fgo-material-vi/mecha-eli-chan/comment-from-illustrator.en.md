Mecha Eli-chans!!!!???? For reals!!!!?????? Since I had no experience with drawing mechas or knowledge about them to begin with, I fumbled around, but it was fresh and fun~~~! At first I drew their faces with a “THE ROBOT” feel, but I got a request to redraw it so they are more charming so I made them cute ♡ (hopefully). I’m satisfied with the letters I added to the drawings of their standing pose like in a monster movie…! (Wada Arco)
