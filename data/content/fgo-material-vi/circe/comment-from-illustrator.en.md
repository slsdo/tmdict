When designing Circe, for the clothes I thought about showing the silhouette instead of making it simple to match the corresponding times. As if the element of 「hawk」 was necessary as well, I continued with the design with a feeling of breaking through one point with big feathers in the whole surface. The point of the pose on her first stage coupled with her whole body being covered was that you couldn’t even know if she had arms. (Hidari)
