Metabo Piglets.
A Reality Marble of summoning.
The boorish fellow invited to the luxurious banquet space is trampled by the beloved pigs of the witch Circe, “piglets”.
Pleasant and noisy, a fearsome banquet of magecraft that stuffs you up until bursting. Those who have learned the taste of ecstasy, will desire to degenerate into a beloved pig of their own will.
