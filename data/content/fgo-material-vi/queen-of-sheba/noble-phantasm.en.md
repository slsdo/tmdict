Djinn triplets obedient to the Queen appear and present difficult problems to the enemy (physically).
The three djinns are named Achat, Shtayim, and Shalosh, respectively.
Once, the Queen visited Jerusalem carrying a large amount of present, in an attempt to receive wisdom from the notoriously wise Solomon. Solomon completely saw through the three enigmas meant to test him, and the Queen was impressed by Jerusalemâ€™s prosperity. The Queen exchanged gifts with Solomon, then returned to her land.
