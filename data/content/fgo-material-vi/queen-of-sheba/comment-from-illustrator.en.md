I am Katou Itsuwa, the character designer. I remember well putting a lot of energy into this design, in gratitude to my permission to add animal years and horns right in my very first work here. There’s something of an origin story to my little djinns. At first, I considered doing them in a more “genie of the lamp” style, but I couldn’t due to circumstances including an already released character doing exactly that. This lead to me just drawing whatever I wanted and those getting used as they were. It’s very pleasant to see than in action as a real Noble Phantasm. (Katou Itsuwa)
