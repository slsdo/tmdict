### Artificial Limbs (Karakuri): A++

One’s flesh has become an artificial mechanism – particularly, a wooden mechanism [karakuri]. A bonus is added to one’s action checks related to combat and the success checks of their Skills.

If it is at least Rank A, not only their limbs but also their entire body has become an artificial “karakuri doll”.

### Mechanical Illusion Arts: B+

Techniques that utilize karakuri with genjutsu working as the core of these techniques.

They are something Danzou especially regards as her specialty. It is possible to apply these to many activities, such as infiltration, spying, combat, and so on. When it comes to combat situations, the “Mechanical Decapitation Method” excels in such situations, but Danzou does not like it very much.

### Subversive Activities: C

The ability to prune the opponent’s military strength in the preparation phase before conducting combat. The higher the ranking of this Skill, the lower one’s spiritual status as a hero.

### Ninjutsu: A

The general term for the espionage techniques, combat techniques, larceny techniques, torture techniques, etc., used by ninja. The version of ninjutsu used differs according to each school.

Since Katou Danzou is loaded with (the First) Fuuma Kotarou’s techniques, her school is that of the Fuuma Shinobi Band.
