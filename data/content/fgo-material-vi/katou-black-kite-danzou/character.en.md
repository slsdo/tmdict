### Personality

A mechanical karakuri ninja with few emotions. A karakuri girl. During her lifetime, Danzou did not have free will and was nothing but a mechanical doll that obeyed the orders inputted into her————or so she had defined herself as, but on the occasion of being carved into human history as a Heroic Spirit and materializing as a Servant, it seems it might be the case that she too believes it is okay for her to think and have emotions – just like humans, and from the way it seems, she bears in mind that if she is permitted to do so, then she wants to do it.

Whether this rare mechanism that was manufactured by the Black Magician Kashin Koji – who gave and poured his heart and blood into her – had ultimately attained the free will she now has, or whether a soul dwells in this mass of inorganic substance, there is no person who can correctly answer that. Whatever the answer is, Assassin Katou Danzou, though vague it is, possesses an ego.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

If her Master appears to treat her like a karakuri, then Danzou will live as a karakuri. Because she can say with confidence that in her view, it is the most reliable and easiest way for her to live. But supposing the case that she is treated as a human, she will try to imitate humans to the best of her ability————

### Dialogue Examples

“————Katou Danzou. Starting up now.”
“Well then, I will deal with them as you see fit.”
“The Five Elements are rather insufficient here. Promptly requesting replenishment… Speaking of it specifically, well, I want to inhale some air from outside.”
“… If it is about destroying enemies, then I will be of great use to you. That is what Danzou exists for.”
“Gather O’ Wind… Evil Wind Death Storm!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Katou Danzou is a ninja thief [shinobi-no-mono], or perhaps a spy [suppa; 水破], whose name can be seen in the likes of the Kanazoushi and the military science books from the early Edo period. The reading of the word suppa [水破] is the same as the word suppa [透波], which is the name for the ninja located in Kai and westward of it, but when speaking of the word suppa [透波] in the same time period back then with those characters in mind, it is a word associated with what is called the Koshu{{n1}} Suppa, who were employed by the Takeda House as spies, so rather, judging from the character [破] in its word, it seems a suppa [水破] was a spy whose existence is closely related to the Soshu{{n2}} Rappa led by Fuuma Kotarou, who was employed by the Later Houjou House. The Soshu Rappa were considered to be a group of 200 ruffians that were led by Fuuma Kotarou. After the downfall of their employer’s house, it is said that the remnants of the Soshu Rappa became bandits and raised havoc in and around Edo, but they were captured due to the secret information provided to the shogunate’s law enforcement force by Kousaka Jinnai – who was said to be a dependent of the Takeda House’s Chief Vassal, Kousaka Masanobu, and a disciple of Miyamoto Musashi as well – and executed.

Regarding Katou Danzou, she is known by nicknames such as “Flying Katou” and “Kite Katou”, and given that there are even books that reference only her name and no one else’s, it seems certain that she actually existed. Regarding those deeds of hers however, they are only mentioned in things like writings with a high degree of fiction and tales, so likewise, she is often an unclear figure because of those as a matter of fact. In those tales, Katou Danzou frequently displays the skills of a Puppeteer. The origin of this seems to be from an illusion technique that was mentioned in section 8.2-3 of the Bussetsu Juuou Kyou Jikidan (Personal Account of the Sutra of the Ten Rulers of the Afterlife) – titled “Fulou-koku Genjutsu-jin (The Illusionists of the Country of Fulou)” – where it reveals a puppet hanging several suns{{n3}} from the center of an illusionist’s hand and makes it sing without any trouble.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In regards to Katou Danzou, there are legends where she operated puppets and karakuri dolls, but those were legends derived from the fact that “Danzou herself was a karakuri doll”————or so how she is set in this work.

A ninja who follows the school of the Fuuma, a clan that played an active role during the closing years of the Sengoku period. And the true form of hers is that of a karakuri doll that was constructed by the Black Magician Kashin Koji. Danzou is an artificial female ninja (kunoichi) who was formed under the collaboration of Kashin Koji and the First Fuuma Kotarou, and she is not a human being that has life. Nevertheless, as a result of accomplishing plenty of her duties and being often talked about even in the books of posterity, that existence of hers was carved into human history as a Heroic Spirit.

In “The Seven Duels of the Heroic Spirit Blademasters”, Danzou found herself on the side of a black magician as “the Katou Danzou from her lifetime.” It was not the case that she has been embedded with a Karma like the Heroic Spirit Blademasters, but that her incomplete mentality was being manipulated by the Caster Ashiya Douman.

There is really no difference in regard to the personality and the behavioural principles of both the Danzou who appeared during the Seven Duels – which is a kind of Pruning Phenomenon – and the Servant Danzou of Pan-Human History who was summoned at Chaldea. Both are similarly ninja who are serious in their loyalty to their lords, and both are similarly mothers who treat the Fifth Generation Fuuma Kotarou with tender loving care.

### General Armaments

Danzou can carry out attacks with mainly a large number of edged tools and shooting-type wires that are built into her limbs. She is able to use both short-distance attacks and long-distance attacks. Sometimes, things like wooden missiles that appear to be of a Kashin Koji make can be pumped up and shot out too.

### Connections with Characters

#### Kashin Koji

Her manufacturer. A cold-blooded man. An extraordinary black magician.

#### (The First) Fuuma Kotarou

A person who should also be called another “parent” of hers similarly like Kashin Koji.

#### Ashiya Douman

A person whose connection to Danzou was born during the Seven Duels.

“He is not a person I met as a Servant of Pan-Human History but… it is noisy…”

#### Miyamoto Musashi / Senji Muramasa

Two people whose connections to Danzou were born during the Seven Duels.

“They are likewise not people I met as a Servant of Pan-Human History but… I feel like they are people I have a great debt of gratitude for.”

#### Mochizuki Chiyome

“Chiyome-dono, a shinobi of the Takeda House. The fact is that for Danzou, I want to get close to her, but from the way it seems for Chiyome-dono, she has a somewhat ill feeling for me.”

The secret concerning the two that was hidden in Danzou’s recorded data was lost to her. What the heck is this “certain incident” that the Katou Danzou from her lifetime actually perpetrated on the Takeda House?

#### (The Fifth) Fuuma Kotarou

When she had been living under the Fuuma clan’s roof for a period of time, Danzou became the foster parent of a certain red-haired infant. The reason is that Danzou, who has the skills of the First Fuuma Kotarou built into her as a database of some sort, was the best “transmitter of the Fuuma skills.”

Sometimes guiding him as his ninjutsu mentor, and sometimes treating him with tender loving care like a mother, this little child was surely none other than————the future Fifth Generation Fuuma Kotarou.

At first, Danzou herself did not recognize Kotarou during their unexpected reunion in Chaldea, but…?
