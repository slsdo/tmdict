I received the responsibility for Katou Danzou’s design. About the theme called ‘karakuri dolls’, I was tormented in all sorts of ways at the time of receiving it. Regarding the things that are called dolls, their limbs are usually being constructed longer than the normal length, so I tried to make Danzou-san’s limbs longer to some extent too, enough for her to give off just a little uncomfortable feeling to others. I came to carry out many trials and errors for this and that and so forth, but thanks to God’s scenario, this very attractive character was finished in the end. I am grateful to all the staff from the bottom of my heart. (Soga Makoto)
