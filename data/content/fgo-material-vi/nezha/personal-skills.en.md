### Taoist Arts: A

By exercising the Taoist Arts, Nezha can manage the numerous Magic Tools [Paopei] that she inherited from Taiyi Zhenren.

### Spiritual Pearl: A

For Nezha, it is not her Spiritual Core, but the Precious Pearl buried inside her that acts as the main part of her body. Therefore, Nezha will continue to resurrect unless this Precious Pearl is completely destroyed.

### Tathagata’s Divine Protection: B

Nezha’s body was given to her by Shakyamuni Tathagata, and its adjustments were done by Taiyi Zhenren. Simultaneously, this body seals her “Three Heads and Six Arms” technique, and it additionally plays a role in controlling Nezha’s rampages.
