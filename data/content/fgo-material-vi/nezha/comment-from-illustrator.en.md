A mecha… Why in the world is Nezha a mecha?… Eventually, I took care of the mecha-like aspect of hers… to the extent that I was satisfied, but at first, I had considered reverse joints. I’m glad I didn’t do that, don’t you agree?! While it’s disappointing since my Nezha’s Noble Phantasm Level is 1, I’m looking forward to her pickup at my humble Chaldea!!!!! (Aotsuki Takao)
