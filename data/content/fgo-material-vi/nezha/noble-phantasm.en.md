A scorching charge attack where she rushes up to the sky with the hyper-acceleration of the Wind Fire Wheels, literally becomes one with her spear, and then descends for her assault. A powerful technique in which Prince Nezha, who assumed about fighting a decisive battle with the Great Sage Equal to Heaven/Sun Wukong, tries to pull out the power of the Noble Phantasm she has as a Lancer/the Fire-Tipped Spear to the maximum degree.

Nezha’s rage, together with the soul of a Great Overarching Immortal (Da Luo Xian) from her previous existence{{n1}}, both of which dwells within her, can allow her to enlarge to a size six times bigger than her normal size. She transforms into her multi-headed, multi-armed Divine Beast form that has three heads and six arms. Having a specialized Magic Tool at the ready in every hand, she opens with an intense offense and defense.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The Da Luo Xian are basically the highest tier of Immortals who reside in the Da Luo Tian (The Great Overarching Heaven, aka the highest point of the Taoist Heaven).
As explained in Journey to the West, Nezha’s previous life being mentioned here (the one even before the time he was born to Li Jing and Lady Yin, his parents in the Earthly Realm) was him as a Divine Beast Immortal that served the Jade Emperor/the Taoist Shangdi.
