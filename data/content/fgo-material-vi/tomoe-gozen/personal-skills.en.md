### Knowledge of Chaotic Battle: B

The knowledge and skill she possesses about chaotic battles where friend and foe are mixed in large crowds.
Itâ€™s not a skill used to lead an army, but rather the fighting technique required to act as one warrior within an army.
Tomoe is quite used to battles between armies, or battles 1 vs many.

### Adrenaline Rush: A
