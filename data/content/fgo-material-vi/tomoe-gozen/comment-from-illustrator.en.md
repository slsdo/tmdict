Drawing Tomoe Gozen not showing much skin, and then going with an over the top armor like in her second stage is what I think was her initial design concept. Though since I had difficulties progressing everything in that direction, I took advice from Takeuchi, and while still retaining some of that direction I was going for, added elements of lighter garment like in her first and third stages. As with her weapons, she’s an Archer, but there’s a strong image of warriors from that period using just about everything so I gave her a bunch of stuff. I wasn’t expecting her to also wield a videogame controller…Afterwards I still wasn’t satisfied with my own ability, and even though I had already presented the illustrations for her ascencions, I wenr back and retouched her design, then redid the whole thing, so after going through all these changes I grew quite attached to this character.
