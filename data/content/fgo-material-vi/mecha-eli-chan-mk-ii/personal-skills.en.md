### Innocent Kaiju: EX

An id_es skill that mutated from “Innocent Monster”.
The magical castle of silver, Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II, flies through the sky with the power of special cinematography, breathing fire, leaking electric shocks, and firing missiles.
That is truly how Eliza VS Mecha-ELiza should be.
She imagines a villainous theme song playing whenever she uses this skill.

### Overload (Revised): C

A variation of the skill that Frankenstein and Babbage possess.
Although it does not increase the power of Noble Phantasms, it increases NP at the cost of HP.
According to the robo-researcher, Mr. M: “This is just battery leak, isn’t it?”

### Final Eli-chan: C

A defensive field which protects both the world and oneself---
By releasing the Eliza particles covering her body, it reveals her true form and final form. It is through and through a war mode.
Her catchphrase after using it is “A kaiju (that thing) who only eats fish is useless, after all”.{{n1}}

### Giant Mecha Eli Punch: EX

Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II docks with the megaframe, her true body, for an attack.
Because there is a mysterious agreement that it can only be used when turned into an enemy of humanity, this cannot be employed under the conditions of having obtained a Master.
In this state, the Mecha Eli Punch is said to be able to hold back even stars of calamity falling from space.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} This is in reference to the movie Godzilla: Final Wars, in which Godzilla fights his 1998 american counterpart, who mostly only ate fish. The american lizard lost in 20 seconds flat.
