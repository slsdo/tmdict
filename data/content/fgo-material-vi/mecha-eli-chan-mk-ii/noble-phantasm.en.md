Breast Zero Erzsébet.
The Ultimate Only One Death Medley in which Mecha Eli-chan throws all her armaments against a single individual.
While Mk.I feels negatively about the song, Mk.II recognizes its effectiveness as a result of the Halloween incident.
However, it differs from conventional musical knowledge as missiles are seen as ballads, lasers as blues, and vulcan sweeps as ambience.
Although Mk II denies it, her intellectual basis is the same as Elizabeth Bathory.
Despite sealing the Eliza-power with her inherent coolness and intelligence, that rarely seen sealed true nature appears at this moment alone, in which she goes on a full-powered rampage.
