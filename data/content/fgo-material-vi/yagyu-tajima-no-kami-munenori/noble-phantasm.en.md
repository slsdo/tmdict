Kenjutsu Musou・Kenzen Ichinyo

Be relaxed while possessing an unwavering heart----

It is the deepest level of the sword that the Buddhist priest Takuan once spoke of having, finally, it achieved perfection within Yagyuu Munenori. It is a sword that shows its true worth in the threshold of life and death, while Zen reaches enlightenment during meditation. A single sword stroke of Kenzen Ichinyo hits a state of being free from all worldly thoughts making it one deadly blow.
