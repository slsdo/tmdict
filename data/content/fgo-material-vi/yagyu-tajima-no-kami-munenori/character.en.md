### Personality

One of the strongest swordsmen of the Edo Yagyuu. A demon of rationality who is unswayed by emotion, gazes at everything with a reasoning of ice. Methodology is rationality, in other words, everything will naturally be fulfilled without any futility by mastering the sword-----

He never speaks of his passions, he does not become restless nor impatient.

He thoroughly carries out the most optimal and shortest measures in order to achieve an objective with the utmost composure. He is a man of ice and steel who is reliable as an ally, but is extremely terrifying once he becomes an enemy.

Yagyuu Munenori is a samurai.

Once he is summoned, he will faithfully obey with Master as his second lord. He could be summoned to destroy the world or summoned to fight to save the world. He accomplishes his task without changing his facial expression once.

「This is fate, I presume. I might have been happy enough to laugh if it was Shichirou, but that wish of mine is not possible.」

「I am truly sorry.」

「----------Apologies.」

### Historical Image · Character Image

A genius of the sword known as the child of Yagyuu Sekishusai and the father of Yagyuu Jubei. Said to have protected the Shogun Hidetada by cutting down seven warriors in an instant during the siege of Osaka (1615 AD). After his death, the third Shogun, Shogun Iemitsu dubbed him as “peerless in swordsmanship.”

He is a strategist and politician.

Not only has he instructed daimyos and their relatives in the Shinkage-ryu, he also sent his disciples to serve influential daimyos as swordsmanship instructors. He is often regarded as an extraordinary plotter in historical novels and plays. This is probably out of the reason that, in the early Edo Period, it would be impossible to raise the Yagyuu clan up to a social position of a Daimyo with 12,500 koku just by being honest and clean handed.

It is said Yagyuu received great trust from Iemitsu as a strategic instructor.

It was documented that Iemitsu had a nickname to call Munenori (Ryuu-tan). It was a nickname that took one kanji character apiece from Yagyuu and Tajima. He said “live Yagyuu” as his order after death.

It was said that he quickly saw through the expansion of the Shimabara Rebellion with excellent foresight.

In the 14th year of the Kan’ei era (1637 AD), right after the news of a rebellion by Christian believers was arrived, Munenori desperately tried to hold back Itakura Naizen-no-Kami Shigemasa, who was tasked with leading a punitive expedition. It’s been said, when Yagyuu was asked why by Shogun Iemitsu, Munenori answered “religious wars are always a serious matter” and “Shigemasa-dono would have died in battle.”

The situation progressed as Munenori predicted. Shigemasa, who’s a daimyou of 15,000 koku, was lacking in strength despite leading all the western daimyou and found himself forced into a hard fight as a result. As he saw the situation turning grimmer, Shogun Iemitsu dispatched his chief vassal, Mastsudaira Nobutsuna, to act as supreme commander, but when Shigemasa was notified about it, he became impatient and attempted an assault on the enemy camp before Nobutsuna’s arrival and ended up tragically dying in the process.

He is a heroic swordsman in the『Seven Heroic Swordsmen Showdown』who appeared as Saber Empireo. Craving a battle with Miyamoto Musashi, he transformed into a devilish swordsman embedded with a karma of absolute massacre as a Servant with a body of flesh and blood. Munenori already attained being a master swordsman, but with his desire to fight Musashi, he was completely distorted and not only did he have a complete state of mind as master swordsmen, he also accepted a violent end as a devilish swordsmen. He is summoned in Chaldea as his pruned phenomenon self that turned him into Empireo---------He doesn’t really talk about the “if” version of himself. It must be quite a twist of fate that the「Yagyuu Munenori」, who should have attained the state of “Zen through the sword,” would stray that far, that is all he will say, with a slight smile.

There are anecdotes of Munenori having criticized Musashi’s existence during his lifetime. He said things such as “Musashi is a member of the Western Army” and “an enemy of Tokugawa.” In his lifetime, Munenori never clashed nor met with Musashi, but was in fact mindful about him------

Or so has been established in this work. Therefore, he was fixated with his duel with Musashi during the『Seven Heroic Swordsmen Showdown』as Saber Empireo. He also knew that she was a different person than the「Miyamoto Musashi」from his own world.

The Munenori who was summoned to Chaldea as a Heroic Spirit has already recognized Musashi’s skills and way of being. He shouldn’t have shared memories of being Empireo who was his pruned phenomenon existence, but-----------

As for what he thinks of the「Miyamoto Musashi」of his own world….that remains a mystery for now.

……Let me see.
They are all magnificent people, I wonder if I shall have a chance to cross blades with them.

#### Tomoe Gozen

Hmm, a photo.
Of a creature that reminds me of Loco Moco? Oh, oh, I see, this is not bad. It’s as if it’s cutting the past!

#### Mochizuki Chiyome / Katou Danzo

This is not a world of war nor is it the Edo period. You don’t have to be stern towards a Daimyo, but…that’s beyond my control.

#### Minamoto no Raikou / Sakata Kintoki / Watanabe no Tsuna

Warriors of the Heian Period, they are seen as people who stand at the top. That terrifying power is at a catastrophic level that defies the laws of science. The samurai・military commanders of turbulent times that we know of don’t even reach their level. With that said---------------
It’s still amusing to confront each other with not much freedom from all worldly thoughts.
Haha.
I’m joking, I’m joking.
Lord.
Fufu.
