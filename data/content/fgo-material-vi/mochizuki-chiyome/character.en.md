### Personality

Even while under the torture of her inherited curse, she carries out her duties as a ninja with loyalty.
Very earnest.
If her lord told her to die she would do so on the spot.
She appears as a calm and collected kunoichi who acts as her master’s eyes, ears and blade, but behind that she hides a part of herself that fears, shivers and cries due to the serpent’s curse.

She carries out her duties in a calm and serious way without any jokes, but…
She actually really enjoys pleasant entertainment, and during her off-time she frequently shows many different expressions.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Loyalty. Very docile.
She recognizes her Master as her lord, and will obey orders wholeheartedly.

### Dialogue Examples

“High-ranking ninja of Kouga, my real name is Mochizuki Chiyome. My class is Assassin. Please give me your orders.”
“I am truly happy.”
“This is the Kouga style.”
“I will eliminate my lord’s enemies.”
“Curse my blood. Curse my sins. Years and generations after Kouga Saburou, here is that which cannot be cleansed. Kuchiyose - Ibuki Daimyoujin Engi!”

### Character Image

A woman from the Sengoku period who left her name in Shinshuu Nezumura’s “Renpan ken no koto”.
She was a kunoichi who served the Takeda clan and is said to be a descendant of the Kouga-Mochizuki clan, but it is not clear whether she really was a ninja or not.

In a way, her existence is…a sort of ironic answer to the proposition of “a famous ninja”, a contradiction to the ninja who are supposed to do their job in absolute secrecy.

In FGO, Mochizuki Chiyome has inherited a curse that was given to the ancestor of the Kouga, Kouga Saburou, by a god, and became a being with strange powers. In addition to serving her lord as a shinobi…
She offers prayers to appease the restless spirits of the gods, as the lone priestess of the great serpent.

In “The seven duels of the swordmaster heroic spirits”, she was one of the swordmaster heroic spirits summoned by the necromancer, and stood in the protagonist’s way as Assassin Paraiso.
It is unknown whether the version of her summoned in Chaldea retains her memories of Assassin Paraiso, but it seems like she has read the documents that were recorded as data.
She condemns herself over what she did, and there’s nobody besides her Master who can console her over it.

### Others

Sengoku period, widow, girl, kunoichi, priestess
Some Servants have made worried comments along the lines of “Doesn’t she have too many attributes?”…

### Connections with Characters

#### Tomoe Gozen

She’s always talking to me. I am very thankful to her.

#### Katou Danzou

So it’s flying Danzou huh, then she…

Hmm, hmmmmm….
(Katou Danzou’s the one who stole from the Takeda Clan so she can’t forgive her for that. However, the situation’s a bit awkward so Chiyome can’t look her in the eye.)

#### Shuten Douji

Uu…
Ah, aaaahhhh…Ahh…She’s…Looking at me…B-But…I’m already…!
(Shuten Douji is the child of the Great God of Mount Ibuki, that is, Yamata no Orochi, and thus posseses the aspect named Ibuki Douji. Because of this she causes Chiyome fear and terror. Whenever they meet, Chiyome can’t help but freeze in terror.)
