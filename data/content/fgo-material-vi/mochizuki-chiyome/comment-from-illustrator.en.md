A priestess who is also a widow, ninja and possesor of the great serpent’s curse. Her lore design had quite a bit of attributes thrown in, so I was able to just make her design in a straightforward way without many troubles. The big sword she has is her ritual blade as a priestess, and in battles as a ninja she uses the smaller one. In her final ascencion art I thought, since even in that situation she was holding her ninja blade with her left hand, that maybe that served as a sort of show of her personality or nature. Now the sashes she has wrapped all over her body serve as defenses, weapons and tools. These were supposed to represent the curse that wraps her body, but uhh…yeah, umm, no matter how you look at it it’s a sort of HOT LIMIT{{n1}}. Thanks. (Hiroyama Hiroshi)
