Utilizing the curse inherited from the legendary ancestor of the Kouga-Mochizuki, Kouga Saburou, she borrows the divine power of the fearsome god of Mount Ibuki.
Basically, she uses her summoning technique to temporarily call forth a fragment of the Great God of Mount Ibuki, that is, the Yamata no Orochi who cursed Kouga Saburou in his legend (the tale of the Suwa Engi), and curses the enemy to death with it.
The target is entwined in the serpent-shaped mana and loses their life.
