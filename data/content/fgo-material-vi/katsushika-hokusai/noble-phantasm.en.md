Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji.
The Great Wave, the famous masterpiece of Mr.Hokusai.
The 21st work in his series of ukiyo-e pieces, The Great Wave off Kanagawa.
A mastery of the brush reached by discerning the essence of nature and reaching a state of mind resembling divine possession, and by preparing the mystical essence in painting, she moves and influences the hearts and bodies of those who lay eyes on it.
Then the awakened Hokusai who made contact with the god of the abyss channeled its madness and created unique piece of ukiyo-e. That is “The Great Alien Sea off Kanagawa”. The original 36 views of Mount Fuji, and the additional 10 reverse views; this forbidden brush has stepped into a state of mind beyond even those.
