I had a lot of trouble deciding what to go with for her kimono’s pattern. I figured Oei respects Hokusai, but wouldn’t wear clothes designed by him, so I went with making her wear clothes with hanafuda patterns that she liked. She probably likes the moon. The rear part of her outfit in her last ascencion is inspired by her own painting “Nightscene in the Yoshiwara”. (Kuroboshi Kouhaku)
