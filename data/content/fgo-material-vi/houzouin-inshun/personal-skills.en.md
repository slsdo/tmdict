### Knowledge of Sōwa: B

A unique special technique that doesn’t reduce the accuracy of hits no matter how many times the same technique is used against the same opponent.
Attacks can’t be seen through.

### Seeking for Truth in Martial Arts: B

One of the skills that is conferred to those who ignore status, renown, and women, and wholeheartedly polished martial arts.
As long as Hōzōin Inshun has the Cruciform Spear, his combat ability increases, and he gains some degree of resistance against mental attacks.

### Two Steps Ahead: B+

Grasps the opponent’s bloodthirst, fighting spirit, hostility, etc.
and commences the attack 『before that』.
At B rank or above, it’s possible to play the first move
as long as it’s not a large-scale attack.
However, the first moves against attacks from something with no fighting spirit at all like a machine,
are rather weak.
