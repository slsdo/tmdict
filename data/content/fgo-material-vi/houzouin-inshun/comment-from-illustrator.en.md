A pleasant and refreshing monk. There are also specifications from Takeuchi-san, youthful and cheerful while being monk-like, and I designed him to look like a man of character. The design of the priest’s garbs is imagined with the appearance of the court rank rising with each Ascension. Also the crossed wound on his forehead was done by a master fencer with two swords he had a match with in his young days… That’s my headcanon. (Matsuryū)
