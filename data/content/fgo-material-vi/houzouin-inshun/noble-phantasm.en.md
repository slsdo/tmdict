Oboro Uradzuki Jūichi Shiki.
A Noble Phantasm that sublimates the martial art of the Cruciform Spear that Hōzōin Inshun mastered.
Against the list of 15 techniques established by his predecessor In’ei, Inshun displays the 11 unofficial forms he established.
It’s the type of techniques devised by Inshun, who was praised because 「That spear reaches the gods and the Buddha」, and makes possible to deal with any enemy or technique.
Also, no matter if it’s an enemy met for the first time or how bizarre the weapons are,
and it’s possible to eliminate the disadvantages due to a first encounter.

It has a high effect against skills like『Instinct』 and 『Bravery』.
