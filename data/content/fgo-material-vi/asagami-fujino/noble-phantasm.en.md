That thing that happened in that nostalgic summer.
Sight away from human sight, caused by her Clairvoyance aggravating…
Using a bird-eye’s view, the gods’ point of view, she visually confirms her target and uses a twisting super-long-range physical collapse.

Her locked pain bursts out and forms a spiral.
Its crumble is like that of a girl breaking down in tears.
