### Mystic Eyes of Distortion: EX

Our good old twister Fujinon.
A first-class item even among the paranormal abilities known as Mystic Eyes.
A paranormal among the paranormal, a rarity among the rarities. They perceive anything that physically exists, organic or inorganic, as a printed image and twist it, distorting and severing the target, regardless of size or strength.
They surpass the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception in their of destructive power, but they’re not almighty.
Because, since the distortion requires perceiving an existence on its entirety, it can’t bend the ground or the being known as a city. Also, because once the distortion is activated, you can avoid damage by moving away from its area.

### Clairvoyance (Darkness): C

Some lights can only be seen by eyes that lost their lights.
Strictly speaking, this is the psychic ability Clairvoyance. It’s not the same thing as the Clairvoyance mages use (Senrigan). Depending on how she uses it, she can have a bird-eye’s view of the scenery, making it distinguishedly compatible with Mystic Eyes of Distortion.

### Remaining Sense of Pain: A

She’s fully healed, and yet she’s still constantly feeling the pains of death. The proof that she’s human.
Since the Asakami clan sealed her ability, this sensation was locked away.
