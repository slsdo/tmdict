This is a guest fighter from Kara no Kyoukai. The first ascension is the Reien uniform we all already knew. The second ascension is her as an Ahnenerbe Café waitress. Since this is a crossover, I doubled down on the fanservice and made her into her Mahou Tsukai no Hako version. Although I decided on those two practically immediately, I didn’t know what to do for the third ascension. I thought of doing “Fujino Asakami”, from a situation where the Asakami never downgraded into the Asagami, so first tried to work around a design with a miko image to it, yet nothing seemed to work. Then I switched lanes upon thinking “Wait, the Asakamis were more like shamans than mikos”, and settled down with the current design. (Takeuchi Takashi)
