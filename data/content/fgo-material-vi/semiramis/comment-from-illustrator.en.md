I’m going cr-cr-crazy over her! “So, the real story behind Miss Semiramis. I have a friend whose strong point is in doing up hair, so it seems that they were absorbed in arranging Semiramis’ hair. If one takes a closer look at her hair ornaments, the eggs will hatch, and they will grow into elegant doves…! Speaking of which, rumour has it that the doves who spoke ill of her behind her back, saying she was dressing herself up to look young, had left behind a note saying “please do not search for me” and disappeared.” (Konoe Ototsugu)
