### Familiar (Dove): D

One can employ doves as their familiars.

A contract is not necessary for Semiramis to use doves as her familiars, and it is not a problem for her to dispatch them with her thoughts alone.

### Double Summon: B

A rare trait that only a small portion of Servants have.

Semiramis can materialize with and possess the Class Skills of both the Assassin and Caster Classes.

### Divinity: C

Semiramis is the daughter of Derketo – the Syrian Fish Goddess – and a mortal.

### Intoxicating Alcohol of the Arrogant King: B+

Šikaru Ušum (Intoxicating Drink of the Dragon). An environmental property of “Poison” is bestowed to the atmosphere around Semiramis and to her magecraft. It is a Noble Phantasm that can only be invoked in the Throne Room of the Aerial Gardens of Vainglory.

Against Servants who possess anecdotes of “poison was not effective against them”, they are granted a debuff resistance towards poison. But then in cases where they have episodes where they have suffered from being poisoned, it doubles the poison damage. It is feasible for Semiramis to select the type of poison used, and she can also freely make it lethal or non-lethal as she pleases. Furthermore, it is also feasible for her to summon even Magical Beasts that possess poison.
