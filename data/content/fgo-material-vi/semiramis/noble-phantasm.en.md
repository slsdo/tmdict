The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Semiramis was actually not involved with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. However, this was established as one of her Noble Phantasms by using the faith of many people that misunderstood it as so.

Because this is a “vainglory” after all, the Noble Phantasm’s invocation conditions are strict. By transporting a fixed amount of earth and stone from historic ruins in the vicinity of Baghdad – the capital city of Iraq – and putting those together, the invocation arrangements can then be finally completed. (The number of days needed to invoke it are about three days at the very least.)

It literally manifests as “a great fortress that floats in mid-air”. And as long as she is inside the fortress, Semiramis’ entire status is ranked-up. Her fame also rises to the highest class, and furthermore, a plus modifier is added when she is attacking.
