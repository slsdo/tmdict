### Personality

An empress overflowing with cunning and ambition. Whether enemy or ally, Semiramis will kick and bring them down, kill them by having them drink poison, and even break their hearts by having them drink poison.

The suspicion Semiramis harbours toward others is strong, and whether it is necessary or not, she will dispose of even her allies. At the same time, she also has absolute confidence in her own power (but so long as she is within her territory).

Because of that, Semiramis’ compatibility with other kings is fatally bad, and it is rare for her to take the initiative herself.

In cases where she established the “Aerial Gardens of Vainglory” in its complete form, Semiramis will exceptionally goes on the attack aggressively for she boasts matchless strength while within the Gardens’ interior.

### Attitude towards Master

Semiramis fundamentally understands that it is a situation of use and be used. Her Master cannot be careless in any way, but if they associate themselves with her honestly, she may open her heart to them. Or maybe, she will use them as her puppet. At any rate, if one is not much of a Master, then Semiramis is an untrustworthy companion.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Assassin. I am Semiramis. Now… First of all, prepare a throne for me. We can talk after that. If you have none, then it cannot be helped, but it is fine if thou become my chair.”
“I will show you a citadel of the skies that no man can touch. Gardens of Vainglory, Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It is fine if you crawl around like ants… Fufu, hahahahaha!”
“Before thou art a cup of poison. Drink up… It is a joke. But that is perhaps the way love is. Be cautious and live, my Master.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The legendary empress who reigned over the Assyrian Empire. Semiramis was born between the goddess Dekerto and Oannes, a mortal. It has been told that Semiramis had been abandoned by Derketo when she was a baby, but doves bundled around her in order to warm her up, perhaps because half of her was divine, and they reared her up until she was taken into the care of a shepherd at the age of 10. Afterwards, she was married to Onnes, a veteran army general, but she was forcibly snatched away from Onnes by King Ninus, who was charmed by her beauty. Semiramis made many suggestions to King Ninus, and although she deepened his favour in her, she killed King Ninus via poison several days after she became queen consort————

It has also been told that at the end of her reign, Semiramis was murdered by her son, and that she was given an oracle that the imperial throne would be inherited by her son, so she transformed her appearance into a dove and took off to the skies.

In addition, the Hanging Gardens was originally not Semiramis’ work. Therefore, the word “vainglory” is engraved into the Noble Phantasm’s name.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Although Semiramis has a desire to rule, it is also not a particularly strong desire. From the way it seems this time, she will totally cooperate as a Servant, for she also has a proper wish called the Human Order Correction. Nonetheless, given that it is a rare summon for her, she does not conceal her desire in wanting to toy with others according to her own whims.

### General Armaments

Chains and the like from her wedge-shaped magic circle. Semiramis can also summon Magical Beasts.

### Connections with Characters

#### Amakusa Shirou Tokisada

The Master Semiramis fought together with in a certain Holy Grail War. Nonetheless, it seems she thinks that it is simply another her who was summoned in a different world, so this Semiramis precisely attaches that distinction… or, she should attach it, but…

#### Other King Servants

Semiramis is terribly disrespectful to every last one of them. If it comes to it, she has no choice but to give them a drink.

#### Atalanta

If only her wish came true, or if only she was by her side. When she was born, Semiramis dreamed of an uninteresting future such as “Say, I do not want to have those painful feelings” and bitterly smiled a little.

#### Mordred

Semiramis’ compatibility with Mordred is so far as fatally bad. Far and away the number 1 Servant she does not want to face in Chaldea.
