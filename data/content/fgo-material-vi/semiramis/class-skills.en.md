### Presence Concealment: C+

Suppresses one’s presence as a Servant. It is suitable for espionage activities.

The rank of Presence Concealment drops greatly when they are preparing to attack. However, this demerit is not included in cases where Semiramis is concealing poison as preparations for attack.

### Territory Creation: EX

As a mage, one can create an advantageous position for themselves.

By collecting specific materials, it is possible for Semiramis to construct a “Hanging Gardens”, which is better than a “Temple”.

### Tool Creation: C

One can create devices tinged with magical energy.

Semiramis specializes in tools that use poison, but she cannot create any devices other than those.
