### Personality

Pretty much the same as a Rider. Oryou hasn’t changed either.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He wishes for his relationship with his Master to be like that between two friends from the same town. Oryou is relatively fond of them and doesn’t mind helping out every now and then.

### Dialogue Examples

Ryouma: “Let’s get washing them all away, then.” Oryou: “I’ll scrub them hard.”
Oryou: “Yaaay. Oryou-san turbo peace.”
Ryouma: “Oh? Time for the Kaientai to go all out?” Oryou: “Right… Ryuu yo, Wadatsumi no Hara wo Yuke”
Oryou: “Done. Time for Oryou’s victory peace. You do it too, Ryouma.” Ryouma: “L-like this?” Ryouma & Oryou: “Yaaay!”
Oryou: “I am the White Serpent of Takachiho. For thy offerings, some frogs would be welcomed.” Ryouma: “Hahaha, you can’t keep a solemn face either, Oryou.”
Oryou: “Fine, I can let Izou ride the tip of my tail.” Ryouma: “Make sure not to drop him.”
Oryou: “Now that you’re a Lancer with no divinity, we can kick that Archer’s butt. Good job, Ryouma. We’re having frogs for dinner tonight.” Ryouma: “I wish it were that easy.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A loyalist living through Japan’s Bakumatsu. Born from a country samurai family in Tosa, he deserted his fief, studied under Katsu Kaishu, founded the Kameyama Shachuu (which would later become the Kaientai), intermediated the Satsuma-Choushuu Alliance, and devoted himself to the restoration of imperial rule, overall contributing a lot to the Meiji Restoration. However, his ideals fell to assailant’s blade, thus he never got to see the age of Meiji.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

An aloof man on his mid-20s appearance-wise. He may be a master of the Hokushin Ittouryuu, but he’s actually a kindhearted guy who dislikes conflict to his very core. Instead, the mysterious belle by his side will take the lead.

His default Class is Rider, but circumstances lead to this manifestation of him as a Lancer.

This form, in possessing of the Amanosakahoko and one of the Three Knight Classes of the Holy Grail War, is a what-if possibility that Sakamoto Ryouma could have attained, and a Servant powerful enough to uphold the reputation of Hero of the Restoration.

If Sakamoto Ryouma is summoned as Heroic Spirit, he’s restricted to only getting either the polearm or the serpent as a Noble Phantasm. That goes to show how much of miracle it is that he is capable of using both.

He is a master of the Hokushin Ittouryuu and his swordsmanship is a force to be reckoned with, but the course he practiced was for the naginata, so the Lancer class is where he can best put his prowess to work. In addition, Super Oryou is bursting with power. Together, they’re an invincible Kaientai.

### General Armaments

Ryouma: Amanosakahoko (because he snapped it in two, he has the ability to split it into two spears). Super Ryouma Gun (can switch into Sniper Mode). “And dontcha forget mah Mutsu-no-Kami Yoshiyuki{{n1}}”.

Oryou: Hyper Power-Up Oryou Martial Arts and easily spammable beams of something unknown.

### Connections with Characters

#### Okada Izou

His best friend in their town. He wanted to stay best friends but their relationship never recovered from their split. After an incident where he got punched, they managed to return to their nostalgic ways.

Takechi Hanpeita

Former fellows who split off due to ideological differences. Takechi holds Ryouma in such regard that he believes Ryouma’s presence would have spared the Tosa Imperialist Party from its failures. After an incident where they got punched, they managed to return to their previous ways.

#### Tanaka Shinbei

Takechi’s right-hand man. In life, Shinbei kept Ryouma away from Takechi. He was probably annoyed at the faith Takechi had in Ryouma.

#### Nakaoka Shintarou

“It wounds me to disagree with Nakaoka in a discussion. Nonetheless, if I can’t discuss with him, there is no one else worth discussing with.”{{n2}}

While Ryouma was frequently suspected, he was trusted by everyone. He and Ryouma compensated for what the other lacked.

#### Takasugi Shinsaku

They share mutual respect, with Ryouma acknowledging Takasugi as The Unicorn Prodigy and Takasugi acknowledging Ryouma as the Dragon Soaring the Skies. They also envy each other, believing one has what the other lacks.

#### Voyager

Ryouma can’t hide his excitement about a rocket that can fly to space. Oryou gets competitive and begins an irregular training regime to fly to space.
