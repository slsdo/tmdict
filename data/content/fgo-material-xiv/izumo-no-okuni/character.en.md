### Historical Image · Character Image

A performer from the Azuchi-Momoyama Period. It is told that Okuni is also the founder of the kabuki dance, and it is said that the dance went through various changes, which led to the kabuki of today.

It is said that Okuni is a shrine maiden from Izumo who went on a tour through various provinces and performed her dances. It is also being said that the purpose of her doing this was for the sake of raising funds for the Izumo Grand Shrine, but that is not certain. Okuni’s kabuki dances attained immense popularity, and it became something that captivated people all over society.

But before long, the influential people at the time shunned Okuni’s kabuki dances as something that corrupts the public morals, and it was passed around among people that Okuni had aimlessly begun a trip to who knows where.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Although Okuni has the appearance of a beautiful girl who looks elegant, her real nature is comparatively playful. The Ayakashi Hunter who dances and fights together with Zanzaburou, the mechanical armoured warrior. She was originally someone who originated from a village that eradicates malignant spirits by making use of Izumo’s Spiritual Evocation, but due to a certain matter, she left Izumo to embark on a trip and travel around the whole country. She pushes on with her speciality, the kagura dance, in the middle of her journey, and she hopes she can continue to change the sadness of this society into smiles with her newly completed kabuki dance.

Whether it is a lie, or the truth, the karakuri warrior that Okuni took along with her is an ancient implement used in religious ceremonies that came to Izumo from time immemorial, and Okuni performed her own modifications to it and is using it as her personal Mystic Code. Although she has been calling it Zanzaburou, it was originally the broken remains of an olden god, or something like that.

#### Shinsaku Takasugi

“That fucking president. In SAITAMA, it was a relationship of us using each other without having our true intentions displayed to each other, but Ms. Okuni’s feeling where she thinks he’s a shitty president is genuine! I mean, are you still alive, you shitty president!?”

#### Himiko
