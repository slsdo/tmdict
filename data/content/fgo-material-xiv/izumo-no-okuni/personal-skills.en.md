### Theatrical Wild Dancing: B

A combat art that is passed down among sealing shrine maidens.

Okuni can manipulate an oodachi that can even compare with her stature with ease, using it to slay numerous demons.

### Doll Kagura: A

Okuni’s unique Magecraft where she manipulates karakuri that are charged with her Magical Energy by dancing. She exhibits that graceful, as well as magnificent, kagura dance in a powerful combination with Zanzaburou, who is her personal Magecraft Mystic Code.

### Sealing Shrine Maiden: B+

A Skill that denotes a shrine maiden who accumulated special training in order to use Magecraft rituals for the sake of sealing demons. One can conclude that not everyone can master this, and it also largely depends on one’s innate abilities. This training was done since early childhood, and it was not even rare for someone to lose their life while in the middle of their training.

The one called Zanzaburou is a karakuri warrior, but its original body, which became the basis for Zanzaburou, was the remains of an olden god that had been sealed away in Izumo. It is being thought that, since Okuni arbitrarily took its original powers out and completely remade it into her personal Mystic Code, those powers have been lost. Although it is a karakuri, something like a will can be barely felt from it too, and there are even occasions where it feels like it is protecting Okuni out of its own volition.
