For someone who would be going up on stage, I finished up Okuni gorgeously. I had thought ‘It seems difficult for her to move in battle since she was completed with a detailed design, right?’, but she moves well; she moves so well…! Whether she is chattering or fighting, I love how gorgeous she is doing so. As for Zanzaburou, there was an idea in the early stages of its design where it was something like a hero robot too.
