### Summer Street!: A

She had the great idea of studying the arts under the mentorship of the ace van Gogh, but the only thing she really learned was that she had no talent for painting. But now that her vivid sense of color is awakened, she breathes new life into her poetry, evolving it into something that steals the hearts of those who come across them.

Later, her Master would be provided with a Mystic Code also named Summer Street. The story behind this is that after she confused the maker with her (unsolicited) advice, she compromised by utilizing only the name… or something like that.

### Nightpool Slider: A

Speed brings thrills. Now that she experienced this excitement, she can’t go back to her ordinary life. She found a radiant performance stage that can brush aside the darkest night. “Let’s take the dive, chan-Mas. Headfirst into the sparkling lights.”

She gathers stars for a critical punch. A Skill regarded as the smartest and strongest since ancient times.

### List of Elegant Summer Sweets: A

Shaved ice mixed with liana syrup… Hey, those words were taken straight out of Sei Shounagon’s classic List of Elegant Things. Japan’s first kakigoori, with a legendary syrup lost to time. Cold as the snow on a winter day, it can be used to prevent sunburns. I already know what I want this summer!

By the way, there’s an ongoing research project to recreate liana syrup, so the day we can casually reproduce the iconic scene of The Pillow Book might be coming sooner rather than later. What a dreamy prospect.
