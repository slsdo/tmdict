### Mad Enhancement: D

The Class Skill of the Berserkers. It steals intellect in exchange for a large increase in physical capabilities. Despite being discreet, courteous, and cultured, she has the potential to transfigure herself into a wild youngster. Note that the regular Sei Shounagon (Archer) does not have this Skill.

### Independent Action (Self-Centered): D

Goes out to have a good time even when her Master is absent.

“Right, let’s go to the beach.”

However, she needs her Master’s backup for things that demand a partner, such as using her fireworks watching, barbecue, or watermelon splitting.

### Law of Ekanaya: B

The Lotus Sutra defines the Law of Ekanaya as an allegory to the idea of being the one and only. Sei Shounagon’s single-minded feelings toward her lady repel all forms of temptation that come her way.

The reason why she doesn’t seem that different as a Berserker, slight trigger-happy tendencies aside, is because she’s supported by this Skill or the memories at its core… maybe.
