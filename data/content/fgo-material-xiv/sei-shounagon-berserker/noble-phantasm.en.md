A Noble Phantasm shaped by a policy of the writer Sei Shounagon: “A summer hotter than what anyone has ever experienced would be splendid!”

Emotional Engine is a source of creativity and imagination powerful enough to create a Reality Marble. In a bold move, she converts all of the energy generated from it into propulsive power to dash through the streets on her skateboard. The gaudy letters she writes with her spray cause the enemy’s mind and body to be pierced by the emotion.

An 1v1 Noble Phantasm highly effective against the Man attribute, Lawful alignment, and Shadow Servants. The super-effectiveness against Lawful can be considered an addition caused by her image as someone who rebels against conventions, but as consequence of it being an ability she learned through enthusiasm and commitment to the bit, she began to regularly unleash her fury on prominent individuals, mainly Sakata Kintoki.
