### Personality

Due to a multitude of combined reasons, including the feeling of expectation and extra hard training in preparation for the inevitable summer, she changed from her original Saint Graph into a Summer-exclusive Berserker Class. Most likely due to the effects of Mad Enhancement, her occasional moments of acting like a poet in the Archer Class become even less frequent, and she became about 30% more annoying. She shows signs that she’s misinterpreting her Class for whatever reason (in her head, Berserker = outlaw) and makes her first impressions on the people around her by randomly playing the part, but this condition doesn’t last long. She most likely gets fed up with her character partway through the conversation.

In 3rd Ascension, she shifts her rowdy demeanor into the next gear. She wears a chouran-style uniform modified into a bikini, and cranks the 80s punk speech quirks full throttle. Even here, she can’t play the delinquent part to perfection, betraying some hints of elegance. That’s Heian nobility for you… Or is it? Any objections? None? Then that’s settled.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Despite her embracing the Berserker identity in all it’s unruliness, she surprisingly sharp-eyed for changes on her Master’s state. Whenever they’re feeling pained, depressed, or pestered by an evil onmyou monk… she’ll appear out of nowhere and drive away the source of their anguish with a loud GAHAHAHA.

### Dialogue Examples

V-v-v-v-vwoom!
Overwrite the dullest moods with an infinite variety of VIVID FULL SENSAAAAATIONS! Heave-ho!
Hm? Did I hear an imitation of a rooster?
No idea what you’re plotting, but it’s better to quit now that’s gonna fail, whatever it is!
Get him, Respectful F! This is real last round!
Our summer has just begun! FIN!

### Historical Image · Character Image

She’s the daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke, one of the Five Men of the Pear Chamber responsible for the Chinese-to-Japanese translation work in the Man’youshuu. A talented woman who gained fame in a male-dominated society thanks to her mold-breaking dynamism. Throughout her whole life, she served only Empress Teishi, the consort of Emperor Ichijou, and remained by her lady’s side until her passing. Her numerous written offering to Empress Teishi were posthumously compiled as The Pillow Book.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A Heian period lady writer rode full speed into the allure of summer and changed into a swimsuit, causing the Berserker Sei Shounagon to burst into the scene. That was one hell of a sentence. She was shaking with curiosity about this sense of freedom she never had the chance to experience in her lifetime and the cool theme of a summer adventure. When she’s partying, frolicking, and bustling about immensely with a crew of companions, it looks almost like this form also regressed her mind to her teenage years, not only her body.

Or maybe… That’s exactly how she was during her times in the gorgeous Teishi Salon, back when she destroyed chairs with her games and made a carriage covered in flowers run around the city. Seeing her sparkling summer form, so reminiscent of their fondly remembered days together, would surely bring a smile to her lady’s face. “How beautiful it would be.”

### General Armaments

She specializes in riding her skateboard all over town and fighting barbarously by smacking people with her hammer and spray can, tackling, shooting beams, etc. Everything is allowed in her fighting style, except mercy. “You can’t tell a Berserker what to do.” Note that her spraypaint is made out of a special material that disappears with time. No matter how dubious or masterful her writing is, nothing will be left behind of it. This Berserker is upstanding to the law in the weirdest places. She’s often witnessed getting chased by Emiya after scribbling on the walls with the kids.

Rumors say that these weapons may or may not use technology from another universe… And sure enough, it’s revealed right there in the 2021 Summer event Chaldea Summer Adventure that they’re items from the Servantverse. Her parallel universe alternate self Space Nagon contacted her through a bizarro space and dumped those space gadgets on her. It bears adding that her Saint Graph conversion to Berserker was also forcibly done through Space Nagon’s Saint Graph Conversion Beam. She’s a handful.

### Connections with Characters

#### Kaorucchi (Rider)

Those two bestest friends[citation needed] are, to no one’s surprise, as close as ever in their swimsuit forms[sources unverifiable].

Comes the summer season and I constantly drag her to beaches, pools, and Singularities.

#### Suzuka Paisen (Rider)

Paisen finally got that swimsuit and that bike license she always wanted, so I get to ride with her a lot.

Sometimes I get too hyped and she yells about how I’m “so annoying”, but jokes on her, I enjoy that.

#### Siacchi, Cordrin, Kamacho

The lovely sisters-in-arms who braved the Caribbean Singularity with me.

Their stars of summer and love were shining in full bright, so I couldn’t help rooting for all of them.

(Kamacho looks away with the face of someone who has a thousand arguments against that statement.)

#### Caemyon

(Circumstantial evidence tells that she tried to join the Chaldea delinquent faction but Caenis and Mordred both rejected it.)

#### The Nimwits Five

We’ve been gaining more opportunities to interact since the events of the Caribbean Singularity.

We don’t plan anything but on the weekends, everyone gathers at Ricacchi’s room.

They are The Nimwits Five. Yes, The Nimwits Five.

#### Nobu and JJ

The classic quartet, faster and wilder than ever with the addition of the delinquent and the race queen.

We still get together sometimes, I think.

Since Suzuka Paisen went Summer Vaycay mode, Okita had to inherit the role of the only sane woman in the group.

#### Sugi-Shin

The finest party-goer produced by the age of the Bakumatsu.

Every time we interact, this man finds something to entertain him, but he is the real entertainment.

#### Locq

“Ain’t bamboo shoots a lot better?”

“Huh? Is it war you want?”

#### ■■■■

A colorful pair.

They’re always complaining that I’m nothing like they heard about in class, but jokes on them, I enjoy that.
