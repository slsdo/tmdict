### Personality

A genuinely Evil Servant who pursues her own selfish desires to the exclusion of all else. Had she been summoned to assist humanity by a Master who was unable to keep her in check, there is no doubt that she would have been the cause of a major disaster.

She has no regard for others’ sacrifices or suffering. While she doesn’t technically lie, she has no problem obscuring truths which could inconvenience her. Her preference is to enjoy her villainy in secret, without risk of being caught. Her loyalty is, first and foremost, to her own desires. She has no compunction about attempting to seduce anyone she likes into joining her in her evil. When the chips are down, her true wickedness shines through.

Regardless of her Ascension, her personality and behavior remain unchanged. Never takes her glasses off, even in the bath.

“This stupid mountain goat’s name is Baphy. She’s here to keep an eye on me. Ugh, she’s such a pain in the ass.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Her desire for the Holy Grail is ’revenge against the French royal family’ and ’the corruption of mankind and the return of the Holy Mother of the Abyss’. Her attitude towards the Master is unrestrained and capricious. Usually savoury, moderately charming and careless. Some days she is gentle, some days she is strangely insolent, and some days she is in an unexplained mood and won’t talk to them.

### Historical Image · Character Image

The Knights Templar was a military order tasked with protecting the people undertaking pilgrimages to Jerusalem. Molay was the twenty-third and final grand master of the order. The Templars leveraged their privilege and spread their influence across Europe, and they utilized their financial resources, on par with an entire nation’s treasury, to function as one of the first international banks in history. However, the order’s tendency toward secrecy also led to a great many unflattering rumors founded in envy, such as that the group practiced black magic. Ultimately, the entire order was disbanded under suspicion of heresy.

Molay was burned at the stake at Île de la Cité in Paris. He screamed curses before his death, and within a year of Molay’s execution, the King of France and the Pope, the primary architects of the Templars’ dissolution, died unexpectedly.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

As a Foreigner, Jacques de Molay is an innocent Heroic Spirit whose Spirit Origin has been altered by the slander and lies spread by the authority figures who envied the Knights Templar. She has also been possessed by an evil god known as the “Holy Mother of the Abyss” who wishes to corrupt all of humanity, giving her Evil traits a boost.

Incidentally, the reason Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky date is because it is said to be the day on which the Knights Templars’ identities were exposed.

### General Armaments

Longsword, shield, Holy Shroud (False), Holy Nail (False).

### Connections with Characters

#### Gilles de Rais (Saber)

Marshal Gilles de Rais. It is an honour to meet the legitimate descendant of Robert de Craon, the second President of the Knights Templar. It is thanks to the leadership of your Highness that the true foundations were laid for the Order at that time, when it was nothing more than a group of poor young men with a dream. Let us also come together.

#### Columbus

Oh. Columbus! You are a sailor among sailors, a true man of the sea, a man of honour and humanity! Yes! Can I call you Columbus? Anyway your father-in-law, Bartolomeu, was a Knight of the Order of the Saviour, but he was originally a Templar from the Portuguese jurisdiction. Don’t hang out with the other pirates okay?

#### Jeanne d’Arc (Ruler)

Ruler Jeanne d’Arc huh…? The way a Servant should be, the meaning of their existence, the meeting with Master that could have happened…… Ah……She is so beautiful… really. It’s a miracle of God. And all I have left is this dirty curse.
