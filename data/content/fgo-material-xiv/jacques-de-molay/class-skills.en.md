### Entity of the Outer Realm: A

A Foreigner from the Void of the Outer Universe. One who has been possessed by an evil god and hides a portion of its power in her bosom, in order to tempt others.

### Territory Creation: A

Creates an advantageous position for one’s self. She becomes the head of a secret society of mages, and gathers magical energy and followers from a wide array of branches located around the temple tower. However, due to various restrictions in Chaldea, it doesn’t seem like it’s showing it’s true potential.

### Divinity: B

She became the forerunner of a higher life-form that lurks in outer space and has been entrusted with strong divinity. It seems that Molay herself is being monitored through a rebellious familiar who refuses to listen to orders. The both of them are the same in that they ignore orders.
