### Innocent Monster: A

This bears no relation to her opinions or appearance from when she was alive; it only refers to the severity of the reputational harm she suffered thanks to malicious rumors.

One rumor said that she worshipped a goat-headed demon by taking part in obscene rituals. Another claimed the Knights Templar are still active, and that their massive wealth continues to be passed down to this day. It was these unfounded accusations brought against the Knights Templar, and the exaggerated stories told about them in later years, that corrupted Molay. As a result, she gained a seductive body that craved pleasure above all else, and has become almost unrecognizable in personality and behavior from the knight who swore to reclaim the holy land.

### Holy Shroud (False): B

A highly dubious theory holds that the Shroud of Turin was actually used to wrap Jacques de Molay’s body rather than the Savior’s. It’s true that the Charny house in France where the Shroud was discovered did have deep ties to the Knights Templar, and it’s also true that the house has connections to Geoffroi de Charny, a Templar knight who was burned at the stake alongside Molay, but beyond that, who can say?

### Investiture in Depravity: A

A powerful temptation technique. In this secret investiture ritual, prospective Templar knights are made to swear fealty to the Holy Mother of the Abyss before the spirits of great knights from the past. An initiation into release and, well, depravity.
