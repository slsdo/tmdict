Friday the 13th.

The “Temple Tower” is the place where gruesome torture and executions begin. The inside changed into an eerie otherworld where a dark mass is being held in worship of a demon. A high-density curse then takes physical form, transforming into a blasphemous creature that washes the enemy away and swallows them into it’s womb.
