### Personality

Just like the nickname of “The Warrior Queen” that she has, Zenobia’s personality is frankly viewed as clear-cut and straightforward. Regarding her reign, she had used both her cruelty and her generosity for different purposes. In some sense, she is a rational and earnest person.
“As a matter of fact, given that I am a talented woman, there are also times where if I was asked for advice by someone, I would have given them some of my knowledge.”

“It seems reasonable to go to bed early in the night to be prepared for tomorrow. What else is there to do other than that?
Umm… That is somewhat… I do not understand it well…” (mumbling)

Zenobia possesses a chaste sense of ethics, and she is a little unfamiliar with love affairs. It is being passed around that she had a sexual relationship with her husband only during the times where she was trying to conceive a child. She does things such as blushing without meaning to from seeing the uninhibited appearances of the Chaldean Servants.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The wish Zenobia wants to make on the Holy Grail is for her to personally clear her own shame away. She also thinks that the Holy Grail is not needed if she can demonstrate such a thing during the course of the war where she is fighting in order to obtain the Holy Grail.

Regarding her Master, Zenobia generally comes into contact with them without any difficulties. However, if that person did something like pitying her or laughing at her after they saw her bounded condition, it seems that they will be unable to mobilize her except by using a Command Spell.

Regarding the Chaldean Master, Zenobia will seldomly call them by the name “The Augustus/Augusta of Chaldea”. This word of Augustus/Augusta means “majesty” and the like in Latin, and it later came to be that it was used as a title that indicates the Emperor of the Roman Empire. She had also given that name to her son when declaring independence for their state, and she takes the stance of “The title is merely a title, and it is something that only has meaning when a worthy person takes it as their own.” It is not the case that she blindly attaches an importance to the title itself. That being the case, even if Nero and the other Roman Emperors become offended and say “That is the title of the Roman Emperor! I, too, am Augustus!”, Zenobia would have an unruffled air to her.

### Dialogue Examples

“The Queen of the East… is here!”
“… You are thinking, ‘What the heck is that appearance’, right? Do not worry, I am thinking of such a thing too. But it is not a problem. I can say with confidence that this is something that cannot be helped. Do not worry about these restraints either. I can fight splendidly even in this condition. In all likelihood, it is for the sake of demonstrating that————Surely it is that reason that I am here… now.”
“Romulus, Caesar, and in addition, Nero, Caligula… Hmph. Well, there are a lot of Romans… at this place.”
(Seeing the Servants with a high degree of skin exposure) “Huh, hold on, for all of you… to openly show your skin like that… Damn, as I expected, you are all being put to shame by someone… You are not?
You are not… Is that so?… No, it is not something I should poke my nose into, but…” (blushing)

### Historical Image · Character Image

The Queen of the Palmyrene Empire (Kingdom) that existed near Syria during the era of the Roman Soldier Emperors in the 3rd Century. Zenobia was called the greatest Heroine, as well as the most beautiful woman, of the Eastern World. She is a talented person who manipulated several languages and studied several disciplines, has a physique that was thoroughly trained, and liked riding and hunting. She supported her husband, who was Palmyra’s ruler, with her ingenuity and strength, but because her husband was murdered by one of his relatives, it has been decided that Zenobia would rule over Palmyra as Queen instead.

Palmyra was one of the areas governed by the Roman Empire, but it strengthened its influence so that it could match up with the disorders happening in various places within the Roman Empire at that time, and it became a great state that governed a vast region that included Syria, Arabia, Egypt and the like. Zenobia, who was the actual ruler of Palmyra, intensified her antagonism with the Roman Empire by assuming the title of “Empress” along with her son as “Emperor”.

But the Palmyrene Empire fell as a result of the military expedition led in person by the Soldier Emperor Aurelian, who ascended to the throne for the sake of restoring the Roman Empire back to its former strength, and Zenobia in addition became a captive. Regarding the ceremony of Aurelian’s triumphant return, it is said that Zenobia was made into a humiliating spectacle, her figure decorated with dazzlingly beautiful gems and golden chains and shackles as she was paraded around within the Roman cities.

News were passed around that thereafter, Zenobia either died, or became a Roman citizen and lived in happiness, but…?

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Zenobia will not forget about her loss to Emperor Aurelian, nor the humiliation given to her in that ceremony for his triumphant return.
The weight of the golden chains;
The ache from the golden handcuffs;
The glitter of shame from the gems decorated on her.
It is also being told that thereafter, when it was nearly time for her to be put up for judgement, she was so terrified with fear, she begged for her life, but————

As a Servant, Zenobia exists for the sake of dispelling that humiliation. Even if it is an uncertain folklore (where she was close to taking sides with Rome), and even if it is lost from her own memories, it is impermissible for the Queen of the East to do something like begging for her life. It is impermissible to be later forgiven and do something like living as a Roman citizen, which destroyed Palmyra.

Rather than deciding that the humiliation itself of her defeat did not happen, it is surely necessary to overcome it instead. Therefore, Zenobia materializes with that most humiliating form. Her true golden age as a Servant is accordingly “the moment she pushes aside that humiliation and dies as a true Heroine.” Even if she materializes in the form from before that time where she was humiliated – from the time where she had been merely acting as the Warrior Queen, she would not escape from derision such as “But in any case, her heart will be broken after this moment and she will turn into a Queen smeared with humiliation, right?” There is no way she can be her true self if something like that is uttered.

This is exactly why Zenobia will continue to assert that very reason with her very own form as that.
“My heart will not break from that sort of thing.”
“Although I am bound with golden chains and handcuffs, there is never a time where I will even yield to anything.”
She is deliberately in that humiliating form————However, she will not forget about her dignity as a Queen, all while resolutely setting her intense eyes on what is ahead of her.

### General Armaments

Manacles and chains (since she is in a state where she is bound in shackles, her fighting style is something like restrained hand-to-hand combat).
Her sword.
Her javelin.{{n1}}
Arrows, fire arrows, stones and ballistas (a system of installed crossbows).

There is a record that Aurelian’s army was tormented by the Palmyrene army.

### Connections with Characters

#### The Roman Emperors

“There are some things to think about. The fact is that, if they were not tyrants, I would have acknowledged them as it suits the occasion, but…”

Zenobia had also ruled over Palmyra as a Roman province until some time.

#### Boudica

It is said that they get along with each other.

“It was the right thing for us to defy Rome that carries out a tyrannical regime.”

#### Spartacus

It is said that they get along with each other.

“Why do you not try joining my army too?” (Zenobia says to Spartacus as an invitation while sweetly smiling.)

#### Cleopatra, Semiramis

Zenobia had personally claimed that Cleopatra is her ancestor, and that she was Semiramis’ successor. If she comes across them in Chaldea, she will become their fan.

#### Iskandar, Ptolemy

Zenobia had also personally claimed to be a descendant of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Because of that, if she also comes across these two people in Chaldea, she will naturally become their fan.

Servants with a high degree of skin exposure, such as Swimsuit Servants and Shuten-douji

Zenobia is squirming without meaning to as if those appearances were about herself.

“Are those appearances… okay? They are okay?… Is that so?…”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The JP text says 投げ矢 (fired arrows), but according to her artworks, she does have a javelin (投げ槍) as one of her armaments. Also, it wouldn’t make sense for fired arrows to be on a separate line of text from her other arrow-related armaments, which that line of text is right below it.
