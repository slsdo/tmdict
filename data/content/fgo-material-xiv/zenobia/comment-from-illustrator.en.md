No matter how much disgrace she receives, the Warrior Queen who denies herself and personifies her ideals will reign in the end. To that end, it was necessary to create as much of a gap as possible between her most humiliating aspects and her most ideal aspects so that Zenobia can experience catharsis when she is set free from her shame, and it resulted in a design like this. After trying to have her shame, her warrior aspects and her queenly aspects stand together, it resulted in an unusually large number of ornaments and equipment being added to her, and the ballistas, which were the cornerstone in the protection of her state, float around the Queen and serve her. These, too, are the embodiment of the strength of Zenobiaâ€™s will, who resists in an attempt to demonstrate the form that she wishes for. (Nishide Kengoro)
