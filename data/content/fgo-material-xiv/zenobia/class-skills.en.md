### Magical Resistance: D

A Skill that nullifies Magecraft spells that were done in one step (a Single Action). A Magical Resistance of the same degree as an amulet that rejects Magical Energy.

### Independent Action: B

The ability to remain autonomous for a while even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from oneâ€™s Master.

As Zenobia has Rank B in this, it is possible for her to maintain materialization in this world for two days even if she is without a Master.

### Riding: B

The ability for riding. In the case of most vehicles and beasts, they can be completely managed with above-average skill, but beasts of the Mystical Beast and Sacred Beast Rank cannot be completely managed.

As a strong-minded Queen, Zenobia had got on chariots and horses out of her own accord. It is being told that she rarely embarks on carriages that were made for women.
