### Assumption of Augusta: B

A Skill that shows how Zenobia proclaimed herself Empress along with her son – her co-ruler – as Emperor. It is said that she gave her son the title “Augustus”, which was the highest title that indicated one being the Roman Emperor, while she called herself “Augusta”, which is the feminine form of the Augustus title and is a title that indicated one being the mother of the Empress/Emperor. Rather than her saying “We want the crown of the Emperor of the Roman Empire”, this is probably something like her saying “It is us, not you, who are truly worthy in ruling the Roman Empire (the world)” out of pride and sarcasm. For that reason, even if she makes use of this Skill, it would not additionally endow her with the Roman Attribute.

It is said that at its height of prosperity, Palmyra had governed a vast region that included Syria, Arabia, Egypt and the like.
