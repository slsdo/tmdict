### Beach Crisis (Poseidon): EX

This skill may seem similar to skills like Beach Flower and the original Beach Crisis, but is actually an entirely different beast. Anyone unfortunate enough to fall prey to Caenis’s outwardly feminine charms will swiftly experience the brunt of the sea god’s curse. Case in point, Fergus was heard saying, “Why is this skill affecting me? It’s not as though they’re exposing that much more skin than usual” just as he was cursed.

### Sea King Style: B

A series of original combat techniques developed in collaboration with Yagyu Tajima-no-kami, which are optimized for use in and around water. According to Caenis, this style is “just for a bit of fun.”, they said. These techniques were neither painstakingly devised, nor are they meant to be passed on to later generations. There is no more than a passing fancy, something of a “why not?” summer dream both parties share.

### Summertime Combat: B+

A skill which embodies the mindset of Chaldea’s temporary summer safety officer. Enhances combat prowess, with an additional bonus granted during near-water battles.
