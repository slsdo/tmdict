Sea Serpent, Storm Blue.
Caenis rides their sea serpent mount across the ocean’s surface and hurls a spear wreathed in sea-serpent shaped magical energy at their target, thoroughly obliterating it. Apparently, it even enhances Caenis’s Attack when its True Name is released near water.

The spear used is the same one used in their Lancer Noble Phantasm, though it has been changed to fit this one. You can glimpse a fraction of its scales during Caenis’s Third Ascension.
