### Personality

Caenis’s Spirit Origin has changed now that they’re wearing a swimsuit. Their personality, however, has not. Well, it might be fair to say that they are a little easier to get along with now, thanks to Goredolf hiring them to serve as the summer safety officer.

For one thing, they don’t pick fights nearly as often as they did before. (That’s not really saying much, though.)

For child-type Servants or the protagonist, they say, “Don’t go too far on your own,” and “Are you okay?” showing a decent amount of care. However, towards romance-oriented Servants, they lightly worry with a hint of sarcasm, saying, “Are you underestimating the sea?” but it doesn’t quite come across.

What they hate the most is still the sea.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

“Looks like I’m gonna be Chaldea’s interim safety officer this summer.”

This is Caenis’s foremost concern in this Spirit Origin, due to Goredolf personally entreating them to fill the position. As a result, they’re a little more protective of both Master and the other accompanying Heroic Spirits than they would usually be…though it’s hard to tell at a glance.

### Dialogue Examples

“Leave the camp to me, I’ll take care of it. Just go and have fun.”
“Don’t stay out too late. Come back before the sun sets. Got it? GOT IT???”

“Dinner’s ready!”
“Maybe I’ll try catching some waves too!”
“Hey hey, if there’s gonna be trouble with the enemy, count me in too. Even though I’m the interim safety officer, I can’t just stand by knowing there’s trouble brewing. Right, Gordy!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

(Same as Lancer)

### Character Image in “FateGO”

By changing into a swimsuit, Caenis converted their Spirit Origin to the Rider class, and was then hired as an interim safety officer by Goredolf in the 2021 summer event. While fulfilling their summer duties at Chaldea, they still intend to enjoy themself in their own way during their free time.

Given the choice, Lancer Caenis wouldn’t even approach the beach on their own, but in this Spirit Origin you might spot them heading out with a quick “be right back,” surfboard in hand.
