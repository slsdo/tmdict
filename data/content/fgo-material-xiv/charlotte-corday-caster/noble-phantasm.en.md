The demon exorcism program treasured by Okuni, who is also a kagura-dancing shrine maiden from Izumo. Her strongest technique even among the kabuki programs in her repertoire that are numbered from 1 to 18. An ultra combination attack between Okuni – who dances with an oodachi in one hand – and Zanzaburou.

A unique Noble Phantasm where Okuni’s way of life of always pursuing the expression of new styles is sublimated, so even after she is summoned, the form and special characteristics of this Noble Phantasm can progressively change into something that is more aligned towards those new styles that Okuni is currently pursuing.

It is often thought that the attacks that are being done consecutively is the main part of this Noble Phantasm, but the true value of this Noble Phantasm is actually the stage itself that Okuni deploys. The Magical Energy that is continuously being knitted over the body of Okuni, who is a sealing shrine maiden, spreads out to the target’s surroundings according to Okuni’s intricate Magical Energy manipulation, which is being done by means of her kagura dance, and that surrounding Magical Energy turns into a great sealing Bounded Field formation that seals any demon.
