### Illusionist (Imposter): C+

An illusion that relies on pure skill rather than magecraft. Occasionally, a truly talented practitioner will acquire the Genuine version. This skill shows its targets, and sometimes experience, things that can’t be seen, or even cannot possibly be real. Of course, since Corday basically fell into being a stage magician, her skills pale in comparison to other, more talented Heroic Spirits of this sort.

### Haphazard Show Planning: A

Even when Corday cobbles her shows together with practically nothing in the way of planning, they tend to go great for some reason. The audience finds itself willing to overlook a few mistakes, and generally goes home satisfied.

### Stage Magician Angel: EX

Corday’s…mysterious angel friend compensates for any mistakes she might make. Really, when you think about it, this angel is the strangest part of all of this…. The angel can lower the audience’s guard, enhance their suspension of disbelief, and keep them entertained…and scarily enough, it can do those things just as well in battle too.
