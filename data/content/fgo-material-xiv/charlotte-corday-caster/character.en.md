### Personality

Despite changing her class from Assassin to Caster, there hasn’t been much change. She’s still full steam ahead on the path of a maiden.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She’s trying to conceal her affection but is failing miserably at it.

### Dialogue Examples

“Step right up! It’s time for a Corday magic show! I hope my auDIEnce will enjoy it!” (Not a typo)
“With a whoosh…Dragon’s Splitting Scale! Oh no!”
“Now then everyone, please give a round of applause!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A 2021 swimsuit Servant. Though still somewhat embarrassed by how much attention her new swimsuit draws, Corday has decided that this summer will be the one where she makes her move on Master.

Her personality may not have changed much, but now that she’s no longer scared of rejection, she’s also being more aggressive, which has led some Servants to be extremely wary of her.

She learned how to do stage magic from a shady, dapper old bartender, and a mysterious centaur sage.

### General Armaments

Various magic goods.

### Connections with Characters

#### Swimsuit Princess

“I don’t think pranks and magic are really the same thing… But isn’t it a bit too flashy for a princess?”
“‘What, I’m quite similar too?’ … Well, never mind about me! I mean, I’m just an ordinary person!”

#### Japanese Princess with Strong Opinions on Villainess Stories

“‘Standing next to the princess, I look like the protagonist of a villainess story?’ That just makes her look like a villain!”

#### Suspicious Bartender

“Thank you for teaching me magic tricks! Look, now I can… um… I can do this! Ah, wait! I almost got it!” (※ Not actually able to do it)

#### Not-so Suspicious Centaur

“Thank you for teaching me techniques to captivate the audience. Psychology is amazing!”
