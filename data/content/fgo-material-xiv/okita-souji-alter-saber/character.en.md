### Personality

First and Second Ascension

Okita’s Spirit Origin, which will be described later, has been slightly cut off and is possibly in the state it was in before it was worn down over the course of a long battle, in this state she speaks in a more polite way like a Junior High School student.

Rengoku has a male tone but the voice of a cute girl

As you can see, this Spirit Origin’s reconstruction led to Okita Alter splitting into two people. This was the result of Rengoku, Okita Alter’s weapon, cutting off a part of Okita Alter’s Spirit Origin and fusing it to themself in order to function independently.

Rengoku was originally a safety device or rather a self destruct device, to destroy Okita Alter if she went out of control. However, Rengoku became self-aware while fighting by Okita Alter’s side for a great many years and began to care about Okita Alter developing an unconscious desire to leave Okita Alter’s side destroy themselves instead.

This desire came to the forefront during this summoning which led to them cutting off a piece of Okita Alter Spirit Origin and used it to materialize a mini Okita Alter.

Third Ascension

The ultimate Okita Alter, fused on a spiritual level with her sword Rengoku and transformed into a complete Counter Guardian. She manifests not as an Alter-Ego but a Saber the original appropriate class for her.

Her personality is slightly airheaded as she is worn out, being summoned from the end of her long battle. Almost the same as the original Okita Alter.

Rengoku is what is called an intelligent sword. They have prepared themselves to be together with Okita Alter until she disappears. To hide their embarrassment they sometimes uses abusive language with her but the unaffected Okita Alter just lets it slide.

“This is why I can’t leave you alone!”

Rengoku is like the uncapturable friend in a gal game.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Okita Alter shows absolute trust in her Master. That is a promise that will never change.

For the time being Rengoku recognizes them as the Master of their Wielder, however in the worst case scenario their Wielder, Okita Alter, takes priority.

### General Armaments

Hyper mysterious swordsman ship action with a large sword and shield.

There will also be beams coming out of her eyes.

There is a shield so Majin is safe.

### Connections with Characters

#### Okita Souji

The original personality but with the transformation from Alter-Ego to swimsuit Majin Saber they’ve become even more different. I think swimsuit Okita’s jetpack is a little nice. She’s at the age where she wants to overboost.

#### Oda Noubunaga

I don’t think she’s that scary of a person but is Rengoku wary of her? “It gives me a headache to think that this guy is a large part of my spark” is what Rengoku was thinking.

#### Chacha

At Chaldea she often takes care of Okita Alter and gives her sweets. A certain young child has taken a liking to her maybe because they spent a lot of time with her.

#### Hijikata Toshizo

He gives me lots of shaved ice and I’m sure he is a nice person, Rengoku. Is that so? But you don’t need pickled radish though.

#### Li Shuwen

I don’t know if Shuwen is taking care of her or if Okita Alter is selfishly following him around or if it’s both, but we often find ourselves together with him.

#### Swimsuit Jeanne Alter

I find her words and actions cool and respect her. “Eh………” Is what Rengoku is thinking.
