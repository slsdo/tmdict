Everytime we do character meetings itâ€™s all a mess but this time, as usual, we reached a conclusion and decided to turn her into a little girl and then a divine idea come fort before we settled on the current form. Rather than just a swimsuit there is half a new character to design but I very much like it. I had never drawn a character as young as Rengoku before, so it was a bit of a struggle but well worth the effort and I received a lot of compliments for the squishy feeling of the character. The third Ascension of swimsuit characters is often dressed up in order to give a silhouette, but I think I was able to preserve a pleasant swimsuit feeling. (Takashi Takeuchi)
