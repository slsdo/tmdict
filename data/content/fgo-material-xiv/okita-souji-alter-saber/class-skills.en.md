### Independent Action: A

As a Counter Guardian with a swimsuit, she is able to act independently during summer vacation. Since she can manifest on a beach in desperate times for the sole purpose of annihilating her target alone, or whisking the target away on a vacation, this skill was adjusted to be high-ranking.

### Magic Resistance: A

As her entire outfit has been reconstructed to match her new Saber class, she possesses more Magic Resistance than the original Okita could even dream of.

Sickliness? She left that at her family home and never looked back. Her favorite shaved ice flavor is Blue Hawaii, while Rengoku’s is a more dignified strawberry milk.

“Oh, did you know Rengoku is constantly getting sleepy? It’s adorable.”

“What’s cute about me feeling drowsy? I swear, you could never imagine how differently your wielder would treat you until you have a Spirit Origin of your own!”
