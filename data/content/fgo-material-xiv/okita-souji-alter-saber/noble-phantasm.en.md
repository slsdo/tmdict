Zekken, Mukyuissen.

Light that surpasses the sun and the moon. It illuminates this base world and opens up the azure expanse. Ultra sun and moonlight pierce the void, followed by a lightning-fast strike from the ultimate demonic sword, cutting a path through endless nothingness. It also possesses the aspect of a Noble Phantasm that cuts anything and everything in half, returning it to nothingness.

It is difficult to deploy when Okita Alter’s Spirit Origin is unstable, and so it can only be used for a tiny window of time while in her first and second Spirit Origins.

That’s why Rengoku and I hold hands for this Noble Phantasm’s big finish. It’s so cute!

…This really isn’t the time for that, Wielder.

Incidentally, Rengoku’s base personality (can we really call it a personality?) is male, and the dagger they carry while in Little Rengoku form is the manifestation of that personality. That’s why Rengoku has such a dashing masculine voice when offering support in their sword form. …But then, why do I have such a cute voice when I’m Little Rengoku? Why did this happen to me!?

…Hehe, you really are adorable, Rengoku.
