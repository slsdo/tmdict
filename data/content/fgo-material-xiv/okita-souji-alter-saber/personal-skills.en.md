### Majinken: B++

The ultimate sword Okita Alter will one day achieve. A technique that arises from the possession of a sword that has never known defeat even in the course of a long, long battle. The incomprehensible ideal of a style of sword that is forever both complete and uncomplete, it is all that remains of the spark known as Okita Souji after crossing the bounds of infinity.

### Rengoku: B

A general-purpose combat operating system run by Rengoku, the sword wielded only by Okita Alter. In practice, itâ€™s more of a support system than a weapon. It has some surprisingly insightful things to say, though this never achieves much since Okita tends not to listen all that much.

### Sun and Moon: B

A Craft Essence made exclusively for Majin Saber that gathers all light into a dark black gleam. With its sun shield and moon armor, its Defense is on a whole other dimension. Even if Okita is wearing light clothing it can read the mood and deploy itself as an invisible protective layer.
