### Personality

Although her class has changed from Rider to Ruler, her personality seems to be unchanged. That said, she does seem more curious than usual, and she has to hold herself back from running around excitedly wherever she goes, though that may just be because she’s in a Singularity. And who can blame her, since she finally has the chance to experience something she’s so far only been able to observe from the sidelines?

Da Vinci had almost started to ask Master to tell her all about the latest adventure, as she always does, but then, she remembered that she would get to experience it herself this time, and flashed an embarrassed, but happy smile.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

“I wonder what exciting adventure you’ll take me on next?” she asks with excited eyes.

Her excitement is about 30% higher than usual, resembling a girl her age, and her responsible side is slightly subdued as she eagerly awaits the thrilling and earth-shattering events she’ll experience.

### Dialogue Examples

“Oh, that’s interesting! Now, what kind of adventure will you take me on next?”
“What should I do, Master? This stegosaurus has imprinted on me.”
“Goredolf, you’re so tyrannical!!!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

This summer has a sense of adventure in the air…
That’s how the young-girl type da Vinci adjusted her Spiritron Dress.
She investigated the records of the various wacky events that have occurred so far, and intends to enjoy them to the fullest.

———Although she wasn’t interested at first, pirate treasure accidentally fell into her hands.

As a result, an unforgettable summer mayhem unfolds.

At the center of this chaos were Leonardo da Vinci and Christopher Columbus.

Though these two lived during the same period, there is no historical evidence of them having met each other.

The child a young Da Vinci spoke to about her dreams probably went by a different name, and the same is most likely true for the child to whom a young Columbus confided his dreams with.

Regardless, the two children set off on different paths, each determined to make their respective dream come true.

It was a promise made just as the sun was setting.
Two children talking about their dreams, though whether it actually happened is anyone’s guess.

Of course, it has nothing to do with her.

### Summer Position

Looking at the records of minute Singularities is one of the few ways Da Vinci is able to entertain herself.
“What in the world happened here?” “How did such a crazy Singularity even exist?”
She would think about how the Servants who were trapped there must have felt, or laugh at seeing her predecessor’s complaining in the accompanying records, even though she knew she shouldn’t.

Though Da Vinci had always admired Singularities, she never thought she would get to experience one herself. That she finally has a chance to do so feels like nothing short of a precious gemstone, and she plans to make the most of it in every way she can.

### Connections with Characters

#### Steggy

She happened to be imprinted when it hatched from its egg.
Though she says, “Oh no.,” she doesn’t seem bothered at all.
Sensing the impending parting, she takes care of the Stegosaurus.

#### Columbus (as a young boy)

When they were children, they apparently talked about their dreams.
Unfortunately, neither of them have a clear memory of it.
She wonders if he (she) has forgotten about it as an adult.
Columbus, however, doesn’t remember anything in particular as an adult.

#### Goredolf

She thinks that they should enjoy the summer together.
Goredolf thought it couldn’t be helped, so he continued his cooking with due diligence.

#### Protagonist, Mash

“Come on, let’s enjoy the summer together!” she says enthusiastically. Since the two of them are very easygoing, they go along with it.

#### Sherlock Holmes

I wondered why he wasn’t enjoying the summer, but I soon realized it was because he’s too used to wearing a coat! I guess it can’t be helped…

Except that there’s no way that “it can’t be helped”.
