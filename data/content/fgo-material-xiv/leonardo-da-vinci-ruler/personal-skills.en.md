### Dreaming Machine: A

A series of support-type dinosaur mecha Da Vinci gave up sleep to develop. Each one has its own unique (though admittedly simple) AI that gives them a degree of autonomy, and they all move just as you’d expect dinosaurs to move.

Triceratops: Fiamma (Italian for “flame”) Futabasaurus: Mare (Italian for “sea”)
Archaeopteryx: Vento (Italian for “wind”)

### Treasure Checker: B

A treasure-tracking skill Da Vinci gained for her very first treasure hunt. While it’s normally meant to detect gold, silver, and other similar ores, in battle, it also serves as a form of active sonar.

### Shining at Twilight: EX

Every adventure has to end sometime. Once the Singularity disappears, it will be as though the treasure hunt never happened. But, no matter how strong the twilight may have been, there was always something bright shining.
Although this skill may resemble Dream Upon the Star, it has very different effects.
