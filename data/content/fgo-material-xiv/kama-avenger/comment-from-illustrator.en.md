From Jacques de Molay (Saber), the lamb is transformed into a goat and the back of the shield resembles a Genghis Khan pot. Since he was accused of all kinds of crimes, burned and then became a Foreigner, I designed her based on the most dubious rumour related to Molay: “The Knight Templar’s vast wealth were later used by the Nazis to develop UFOs” That’s why the design looks a bit like a space suit. I also tried to make a design that would make Saber Molay faint if he saw it. (Kouhaku Kuroboshi)
