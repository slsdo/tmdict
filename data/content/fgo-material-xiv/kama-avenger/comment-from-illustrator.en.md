The First Ascension had cute flowers, while the Third Ascension had the image of a God (Demon King) those two were set from the start but the Second Ascension was a two month long struggle. The work was truly weighing on my mind at that time. I didnâ€™t notice it at all when it was made, but when I looked at it again after it was implemented, I was surprised at how great the Third Ascension looked. I felt like if that was safe, I could do anything. I drew as many ideas and differences as I could and sent them to them so that they could choose and use them,and they decided to use them all. I felt so thankful. (ReDrop)
