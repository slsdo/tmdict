### Avenger: B

“You’ve become cute these days” A skill obtained to avenge affectionate words like such from Parvati. As the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Mara, she has a reason to take revenge on the Buddha, as the God of Love, Kama, she has a reason to take revenge on Shiva. She seems to have increased the rank of this Skill by forcing this interpretation. Increases own NP generation rate when taking attack She easily gathers hatred and resentment (As a result of her bold moves this is especially true of the group that loves Master).

### Oblivion Correction: B

Avengers never forget. Whether it’s that her body was burnt by Shiva. Or that there was someone she couldn’t defeat despite all her love.

### Self-Replenishment (Magical Energy): A

Her magical energy will forever continue to flow until she accomplishes her revenge.

### Independent Manifestation: E

A special skill. The corruption of love originally had the ability to appear anywhere… but now she can only manifest in front of the Master. As such the Skills rank has been lowered.

### Magic Resistance: A

Cancel spells of A-Rank or below. Modern mages are unable to harm her with their magecraft.

### Riding: A

All vehicles and all creatures but those of Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast-rank can be used as mounts. Kama’s mount is said to be a parrot. This time she’ll be riding a float shaped like the sea monster Makara.

### Divine Core of the Demon King(?): B

Kama says that when got her summer spirit origin her “Divine Core of the Love God” changed and this new skill shows that she is a terrifying Demon King. With this she claims that her “Mara side is coming out strongly” despite that fact however it is pretty much hearsay as the impression she gives hasn’t changed at all Same effect as Divine Core of the Love God.
