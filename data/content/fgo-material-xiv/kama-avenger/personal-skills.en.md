### Makara Floating: A

A perfect skill for summer waterplay. Kama is said to also have ties to Makara, a sea monster from Indian mythology. Makara is also the vehicle (vahana) of Varuna, the water goddess, and Ganga, goddess of the river Ganges, which means it has the power to control water. In addition to being comfortable to float on, Kama’s mysterious shark and crocodile floaties can overcome even the roughest waves. At times, they can be even faster and more maneuverable than a jet ski.

### Hollow Evil: EX

As a result of acquiring an Avenger Spirit Origin, Kama, who was connected to the universe thanks to Shiva incinerating her, became even more deeply intertwined with the unusual magecraft temperament of the girl whose body she inhabits. Consequently, her summer version is able to attack by manipulating a unique form of magical energy. Though the fires of depravity will never disappear, this skill does help to lessen them considerably. That’s why there appear to be fewer flames burning her body in her Third Ascension.

### Midsummer Sea Mara: EX

This skill demonstrates just how seriously the Demon King is taking summer. You can think of it as the summer version of Mara Pāpīyas. It suppresses her usual unmotivated attitude and makes Kama a little more…proactive. Who knows? It may even prompt her to respond to requests she would normally turn down because they’re “too much trouble” with a more accommodating “Eh, why not? It is summer, after all.”
