With Love Comes Summer Romance.

A version of Kama’s flower arrow (Sammohana) that changed its appearance to better suit its use during summer: a cute floatie ring that couldn’t be better-suited to a pretty young girl. This weapon, for a weapon it is, makes anyone who sees her fall in love. Once this NP hits its target, its sheer corruptive power bursts out in the form of a shadowy giant. Not even Kama herself knows why that happens.

“Rūpāstra” is another of Kama’s names. It means “one who possesses the weapon of beauty.”

With Romance Comes Depraved Love.

An invitation to depravity, performed while Kama’s Mara aspect is openly dominant, this is a dark universe that ultimately leads to love. While that part may not be meaningfully different than usual, in this Spirit Origin, it manifests as something deeper, and more hollow.

Anyone who falls into this depraved darkness will never escape it. One could say this entire space is a void transformed by flame. Instead of Love Flame, which brazenly incinerates those it touches, this dark, empty flame dissolves its targets with nary a sound.
