### Snow White Princess: B

One of the fairy tale factors Elisabeth has absorbed. She gains various buffs such as Invincible for 2 turns (or 3 times Invincibility), but as a demerit, she enters a “poisoned” state. Shocking exactly no one, it comes from “Snow White.”

### Red Hood Slicer: A

One of the fairy tale factors Elisabeth has absorbed. Her attack increases, but as a demerit, she suffers a defense debuff. This one’s from “Little Red Riding Hood,” if you somehow hadn’t guessed.

### Glass Cinderella: EX

One of the fairy tale factors Elisabeth has absorbed. If you can’t work out where it’s from, weeell…

With the exception of her Riding Skill, each of these is a unique skill Elisabeth made to take advantage of the different fairy tale factors she’s absorbed. While each does create a poison (demerit) as well as benefit, that doesn’t stop them from being very powerful.
