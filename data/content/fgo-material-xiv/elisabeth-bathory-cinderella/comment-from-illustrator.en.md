Elisabeth Cinderella, your singing was wonderfully exquisite and terribly splendid!!!! I remembered the costume of Cinderella from the old-fashioned and excessively large three major fairy tale collection that was at my grandmother’s house, and I drew it while faintly recalling that image. The dress is imagined like a glass dress to match the glass slippers. I drew her a bit thinner than usual as a pitiful Cinderella, but since Eli-chan is already thin, I regret making her a bit too thin…” (WADARCO)
