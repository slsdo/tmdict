### Personality

Eli-chan has gone even further down the fairy tale rabbit hole to become a version of Cinderella who is in love with falling in love and dreams of dreaming big. In this form, she’s left her pop idol roots behind to transform into an idol of musicals (meaning of the movie and theater genre, rather than representing any ability to actually carry a tune). Which is whyyy♪ she now siiings♪ almost every chance she geeets♪ The drab, plainly clothed Spirit Origin reminiscent of pre-fairy godmother Cinderella she has when we first meet her in her pre-First Ascension is almost like a chrysalis of sorts. Upon being summoned, assuming that her prince has found her, her Spirit Origin transforms its old, raggedy clothes into a fancy ballroom gown.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Being Cinderella, she naturally assumes the protagonist is her prince, but soon realizes that might not be the case. Undeterred, if her Master isn’t a prince, she’ll just turn them into one. “If you’re not a prince, I’ll make you one. Let’s take over a kingdom!” Why is Eli-chan turning fairy tales into strategic simulations?

### Dialogue Examples

“I am\~♪ The most beautiful\~ princess\~ in the world~♪ And also an idol\~♪”

### Historical Image · Character Image

She follows the tradition of the various Elisabeth Báthory incarnations.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

At long last, Eli-chan has made her comeback. And this time, she’s leading a children’s story-centric charge starting with the ultimate princess, Cinderella. Now that she embodies, idols, Cinderella, and fairy tales, the three things children around the world care about more than anything, she has nothing to fear at all.

“I don’t know. That’s still not much different from my usual self.”
“Yeah. If I’m going to survive the Great Elisabeth War…”
“I’ve got it! Musicals!”

And so, Elisabeth began singing her way through every battle and indeed even every conversation. Meanwhile, Tamamo sighed, and took out her trusty earplugs.

What she seeks is to be the epitome of a princess.

Elisabeth’s essence is defined by her beautiful dress, which she considers central to her identity. She doesn’t intend to mimic anyone else. With a prince-like figure already nearby and no glass slipper left behind, there’s no need for someone to come searching for her. If she ever desires a prince, she plans to jump into a pumpkin carriage and simply capture one.

In Elisabeth’s Cinderella world, there are no stepmother and stepsisters. Any oppression would be met with tenfold retribution through her advanced torture techniques, leaving no trace but screams.

Some may point out that Elisabeth is just a version of Cinderella wearing glass slippers, and they are mostly correct.

### General Armaments

She uses various props from Grimm’s fairy tales as weapons. Though she questioned if the poisoned apple counts as a villain’s weapon, she liked the idea of attacking with it and let it be.

### Connections with Characters

#### Other Elisabeths

“We’re the same but rivals~♪ Rivals but like-minded friends~♪ This is the great Elisabeth era~♪”

#### Hans Christian Andersen

#### Jacques de Molay

“Not quite sure, but she seems like a villain! She had an evil-looking face! So, let’s\~♪ sing\~♪ and stop the tragedy\~♪ By covering my ears, it stopped\~♪”

#### Seven Servants

“Stop it\~♪ Don’t fight\~♪ over me\~♪… They’re not fighting\~♪ Well, that’s that\~♪ Fight\~♪ Fight more\~♪”

#### Li Shuwen (Assassin)

“Real-ly~?♪”

#### Nursery Rhyme

Eli-chan doesn’t accept complaints about what fairy tales mean to her, but she feels a bit down about it\~♪ Still, Elisabeth’s strength lies in her quick recovery\~♪
