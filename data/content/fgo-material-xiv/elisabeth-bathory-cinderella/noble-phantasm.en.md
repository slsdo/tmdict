Fairy Tale Erzsébet.
An offensive Noble Phantasm that converts fear of fairy tale villains and admiration of their heroes into attack power. Its strength fluctuates depending on how well-known the fairy tale is, but in the modern world, it consistently outputs moderate to maximum damage.

In addition, when other Servants with fairy tale attributes are near Elisabeth, she gains new attack methods as well. Together, these two boosts are so effective that they fully compensate for this NP’s lack of power.

Incidentally, whether a Servant has the fairy tale attribute or not is entirely a matter of Elisabeth’s personal opinion, so any Servants who object to being classified as such should address their complaints to her.
