### Marble Phantasm: D

Though Arcueid normally has this skill at A, here it has been ranked down to D.
True Ancestors in a Luminary state can only use their Marble Phantasm in an approximate manner.
Due to having turned into a Luminary, she cannot construct any detailed fantasies.

### Event Storage: EX

The ability to conceptually and physically store things that have been cultivated on the surface of Earth.
The confiscation of all creations birthed on the surface of the planet—its Textures.
An ability on par with the Divine Spirits’ so-called ‘Authorities’, though given that it’s a function possessed by the planet, it is less of a skill, and more of a system.
The gravitational field that appears under Arcueid’s feet when she has turned into a Luminary has enough of a reach to store all Textures on Earth.

### Mana Discharge (Planetary): A

The super version of Mana Discharge—the Breath of the Planet.
What animals know as ‘breathing’. She inhales magical energy (mana) from the atmosphere and then exhales it into the outer world as new magical energy after circulating it through her body—a Mana Cleaner.
This is the reason why the Earth gets filled with high-density mana when the Luminary appears, causing humans to die.
The gravitational field that appears under Arc’s feet when she’s turned into a Luminary has enough of a reach to store all Textures on Earth.{{n1}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The last line of Event Storage and Mana Discharge being essentially the same (aside from Arc’s name) is not an error. This is really how it is.
