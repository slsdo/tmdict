Special abilities endowed to the body from birth such as those possessed by Shiki, Kohaku and Hisui are known as physic abilities.
Whether it be through training or studies, they are impossible to obtain after birth, no matter the method.
Through successive inbreeding, it’s possible to pass these psychic abilities on to some extent, even if it’s not possible to perfectly reproduce the ability possessed by the parent.
Shiki could be seen as an even further mutation, as he belongs to the Nanaya clan, who have passed along one of these mutations for generations.
(*The Nanayas’ special ability is not associated with “death,” but rather concerns “karma.” The reason this altered into “death” in Shiki’s case is because of his near-death experience)
