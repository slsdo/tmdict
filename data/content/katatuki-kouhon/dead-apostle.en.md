Something much like what the public at large imagines a vampire being like.
Immortal, weak to sunlight, sucks human blood, transforms into beasts or mist, etc…
They’re called vampires in the game as to make things a bit easier to understand.
*However, the creature known as the vampire started being talked about in the 1900s. In real folklore, they’re actually the monster with the lowest pedigree. In contrast, werewolves, who are often seen as their henchmen, are monsters passed down from days of old—in fact, parts of what the vampire was modeled after were lycanthrope characteristics.
That’s why in the world of Tsukihime, they are more properly treated as bloodsuckers—the general term for things that suck blood from their own kind.

Dead Apostles are—just as one would imagine from their name—dead. They are divided into those that have been transformed into one by some kind of magecraft, and those that have had their blood sucked by a True Ancestor, and become its puppet.
Unlike True Ancestors, both of these kinds have to suck human blood in order to survive. Blood is considered a necessity for them to live.
They’re also weak to sunlight, and as they’re unable to completely rid themselves of the shared awareness of being human, they are defeated when faced with religious cleansing rites.
