The city goes by the name of Souya.
In the previous version of the game, we used a provincial city as the setting, but now, we’ve changed it to an urban one. It is a fantastic place, neighboring a gigantic factory about four stations away, reminiscent of the Tokyo-Yokahama Industrial Area.
The protagonist’s high-school lies close to a residential area far from the station, and as such, he does not hang out there on his way home from school. At the end of this residential district lies a forest that has been there since ancient times, and by this forest’s entrance stands the mansion of the great landowner Tohno family.
