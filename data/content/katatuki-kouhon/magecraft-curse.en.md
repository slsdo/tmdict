Technology used by Ciel and Roa. Known as magecraft—spatial interference and application methods based on rituals (systems).
Magecraft can be used by just about anyone with enough training, but the potency depends on the individual’s own qualities (the number and quality of their Magic Circuits).
In the story of Tsukihime, runes, kabbalah, curse, witchcraft, wonderworking, etc, are all bundled together as magecraft. Xian arts and esoteric buddhism are also included in this category, but as they’re part of a different faction, they’re not brought up in Tsukihime.
Magecraft is basically all-purpose, however, it cannot make the impossible possible.
At the end of the day, magecraft is a technique for abbreviating the processes of methods already possible to the individual themselves.

“Sure, it’s amazing being able to shoot fire from one’s hands—but nothing more than just amazing. If all you wanna do is shoot some fire, wouldn’t it be more efficient to just bring a blowtorch?”
