“This is our armament, and that’s all you need to know!”
“…Brother.”
“What is it, Sister?”
“Perhaps it’s best if you elaborate a bit more. After all, it’s not often for a human to journey with us this far.”
“They have the other folks from the Argo who can do the explaining. But maybe you’re right. If they have some time to spare…I guess I can talk a little more about it.”
“Very good, Brother.”
“Our armament consists of my sister’s sword and my disc. Both are essentially made of light, or starlight. The invincible adamas, also known as divine steel, was used in its construction.”
“Adamas is also used in the Heroic Spirit Odysseus’s armor and Noble Phantasm.”
“And I think Achilles’s shield and armor were also made from adamas.”
“Is that so?”
“Maybe…I think?”
“Perhaps it’s best to ask him personally, Brother.”
“Heh. That’s a good idea, Sister. So there you have it, Master. We have some business to attend to, so we’ll be off now!”
