“Oh, I have a great idea! It’s a superb idea with no strings attached whatsoever!
If Operation God Destroyer goes as planned and we all come out unscathed, let’s hold a banquet, with plenty of delicious food!”

While victory was achieved, the promise could not be fulfilled.
This is a record of the past.
Dazzling memories that remain within your heart.
And yet, if such a future was possible, you humans would surely look at this scene and use it as your strength to rise up.

Just like a certain “ordinary” Master who managed to achieve so many impossible things…
…As he rests inside a coffin of uncertainty and the void.
