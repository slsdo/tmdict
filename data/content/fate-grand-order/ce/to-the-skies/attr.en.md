The starry sky…
Countless sparkles scattered across the night sky.
And a pair of someone’s arms are held out, extended, as if embracing that brilliance in its entirety.

You think:
Those must surely be the arms of the supreme god you know.

You see:
That those are the arms of the supreme god…

And you know:
That those arms will eventually reach the skies, and they are the arms of the supreme god who formed a contract with you…they are arms that work for you, and they will work for whoever comes after you. They represent tomorrow…the future…

The arms are love…
Romance…
A human’s dream given form.
