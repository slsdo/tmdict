I couldn’t bring myself to like magecraft.
I couldn’t engross myself in the world of mages.
I was simply learning about it out of resignation and duty.

And yet, in this place…
I appeal to my ring, here in the garden that my mother left me.
Even if I can’t do anything, I can at least choose to fight.
