The young boys’ goal was to defeat the most sinister card master.
They carry their bravery in their hearts and put their hopes in the hands they are dealt.

“Card set! Let’s go, Apollo!”
“That’s a good hand! This is getting interesting!”
“Do not expect me to let my guard down!”

Will the young boys be able to overcome the many strategies Mister Catapult employs to block their efforts to obtain the master badge!?

“Do you think my strategy cruel!? Make no mistake, it is a necessary sacrifice.”
