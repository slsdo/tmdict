Under the name of the golden tree, two family lines branched out and bloomed.

The Icecolle Family of the Dark Arts.
The Musik Family of Alchemy.

The two heads of the houses later participate in the world’s Great Holy Grail War, and both ended up with completely different outcomes than they expected.

For one head, it was owed to their hidden selfishness and greed.
While the other, it was owed to a sense of good that they didn’t even realize they had.
