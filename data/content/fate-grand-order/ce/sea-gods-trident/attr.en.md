Mine is the blade of a god.
Which means this is a god’s armament…the sea god’s trident!

This here’s also a type of Noble Phantasm.
One of my Noble Phantasms, “Poseidon’s Blessing,” is essentially a type of protective blessing, but this spear itself is both protection and a blessing for attacks.
Normally, this thing’s an awesome Divine Construct that can even control the sea’s Authority…but don’t get your hopes up too much. As long as it’s here among my equipment, there’ll be restrictions on using Authority. And if it’s used too much…hey! Not that I can properly use Authority anyway! My Divine Core would shatter and I’d die!
And you won’t walk out unscathed, since you’re contracted with me and all!

Huh?
I’m worried about you?
What the hell makes you think a stupid thing like that!?
I’ll kill you, bastard!
Yeah, I’ll do it.
