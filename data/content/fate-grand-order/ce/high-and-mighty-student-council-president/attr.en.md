“Whoever wrote this letter saying ’the unparalleled Jason is the best, most perfect student council president ever!’ really knows what they’re talking about!”
“…I have a pretty good idea who sent that.”

The student council president may be a bit haughty, but with the help of the prefect, who is also the top student in professor Chiron’s class, and the excellent accountant who basically never comes out of the infirmary, the student council is always rock-solid.

The boisterous voice of the president, who happens to also be the captain of the yacht club, echoes through the student council room.
