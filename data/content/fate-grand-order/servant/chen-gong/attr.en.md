A military commander during the end of the Han dynasty.
Chen Gong was born in East Wuyang County, Dong Commandery of the Yan Province (present-day Shen County in Liaocheng, Shandong Province). He is a military tactician who made a name for himself during China’s warring period.

Initially, he served the warlord Cao Cao. After gaining his lord’s trust, Chen Gong defected, joining Lu Bu, who was widely considered to be a terrible menace to China during this turbulent time. Together, they fought Cao Cao for dominance of the land.

After multiple defeats, both Chen Gong and Lu Bu died at the city of Xiapi. It was said that their trials and executions were personally overseen by Cao Cao.
