A warrior and tyrant who appears in Greek mythology. She went on many adventures with the many heroes who comprised the Argonauts. According to myth, she was born female and was later turned into a man.

Originally, she was a woman famed for her beauty, considered to be one of the most beautiful maidens in Thessaly. While she turned down many suitors, she one day found herself the object of Poseidon’s desire…and so lost her chastity.

Pleased with himself, the sea god promised to grant any wish she might have, to which Caenis replied: “Please take from me my womanhood, so that I may never be made to endure this again.” And so, according to legend, Caenis was transformed into an invincible man.

Whether this story holds any truth is unclear. One legend holds that after dying, Caenis became a golden-winged bird and vanished into the skies. Another claims the corpse left behind was found to be female.

Either way…

Caenis/Caeneus in their later went on to become a powerful warrior and a tyrannical ruler.
