### Bond 2

A soldier who harbors great anger within.
They dislike the sea.
They dislike the gods.
Their anger is intense enough for an Avenger.
Normally, they do not permit it to rise to the surface.
In fact, they may even have a smile for you if they are in a good mood.
Even if they are in a bad mood, they will respond should you address them, and perhaps engage in idle chitchat.
They like sweets, and will quite enjoy the topic of snacks, should it come up.

But be warned…
Once their anger is truly unleashed, they are uncontrollable.
Their fury is on par with a Berserker’s, and may even result in their killing their own Master.
