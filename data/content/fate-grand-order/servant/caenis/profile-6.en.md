### Clear Main Quest 「The Journey Continues」

In Part 2, Caenis appears as Kirschtaria Wodime’s Servant, serving in spite of the intense hatred for all things divine…not because of Kirschtaria’s exceptional charisma, but because he explained the truth behind his plans to restructure the Age of Gods.

To turn all humans into gods and restructure the Age of Gods…would mean that the gods from the previous ages, including the ancient Greek gods, would lose their position. This, of course, would include the object of Caenis’s fury: Poseidon himself!

“That’s brilliant…that’s the best payback ever!”

Caenis wholeheartedly supported Wodime and his cause.

“In that case, I will brandish all the protections and blessings of the sea god endowed upon the Noble Phantasm harbored within my body!”
