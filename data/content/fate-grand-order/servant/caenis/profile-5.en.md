The Sea God, Great Raging Tidal Wave.
The target is crushed by an immense ocean current, regardless of whether they are at sea, on land, or in the air. This offensive Noble Phantasm is powerful enough on its own, but if near or on the water, its STR grows drastically.

It is a partial reproduction of Poseidon’s Authority over the ocean, since its full effect would have made it Anti-Nation or perhaps something even grander. It is not typically used in this game.
