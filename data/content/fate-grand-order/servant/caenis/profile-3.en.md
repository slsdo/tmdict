### Bond 3

Manifested as a Servant with a female form. Their True Name is “Caenis,” the name that was used through her life as a woman.

It is said that Caenis turned into a bird with golden wings upon death. That legend is reflected in the Noble Phantasm Caenis uses when manifesting, though there is a possibility that this is because of the Noble Phantasm’s intrinsic special ability to transform the user’s body at will had gone berserk. This may also be why Caenis manifested as a woman, or why there are animalistic characteristics mixed in.

As Caenis rises through Ascensions, the Core of the Sea God and Poseidon’s Blessing Noble Phantasm (expressed as a skill in the game) become more pronounced, and the form they take bears more characteristics from their life. This means Caenis grows closer to the shining, incomparable being clad in majestic armor in the likeness of the great sea god Poseidon…
…as the invincible soldier.

And as a result of receiving intense grace from Poseidon, their Spirit Origin is configured with a spiritual rank at a greatly elevated state…to the point that it does not fit in the Heroic Spirit container. Thus, the soldier Caenis manifests here as a Divine Spirit Servant.
