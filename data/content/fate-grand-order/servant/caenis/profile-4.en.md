### Bond 4

#### Madness Enhancement: EX

As a barbarous hero, Caenis possesses a special kind of Madness Enhancement in this manifestation. While retaining senses normally, the moment their anger exceeds a certain threshold, Caenis becomes a violent storm Lancer who is beyond communication or reason. Instead of having the potential to kill Master, Caenis simply WILL kill Master and cease manifesting.

#### Core of the Sea God: B

As a Heroic Spirit, Caenis would not under normal circumstances possess a Divine Core, but Poseidon offered their Spirit Origin a special grace. Therefore, when Caenis is summoned as a Servant, it is with a pseudo-Divine Core and elevated to the rank of Divine Spirit rather than Heroic Spirit.

#### Poseidonâ€™s Blessing: A

A perfect defense akin to immortality. This skill functions as a conceptual defense mechanism. Normally this would be a continuously active Noble Phantasm, but it is expressed as a skill in this game.
