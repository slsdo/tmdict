The Tengu girl who was the talk (probably) of the mountains of Kurama is ready to hit the beach! It turns out this great strategist also knew how to have a good time! Swimsuit Ushiwakamaru is no longer the Ushiwakamaru you knew; her agility, her divine power, and her skimpy swimsuit make her the true Tengu maiden of Kurama.

“My fleet feet and the beautiful natural scenery all around… My memories of training in the mountains are returning to me!
Oh, the fan? It’s a hand-me-down from my mentor, so please don’t let it bother you!”
