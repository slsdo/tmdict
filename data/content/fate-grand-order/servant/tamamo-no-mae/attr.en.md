A shrine maiden who wanted nothing more but to be a good wife.
She served Emperor Toba at the end of the Heian period and was known as the most beautiful woman of her day.
Some say that sheâ€™s actually the Nine-Tail Demon Fox in disguise.
Well, a lot happened and she was chased from the palace, then gave herself up to humans and stuff.
