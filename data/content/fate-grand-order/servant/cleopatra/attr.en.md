Cleopatra VII, a tragic queen whose beauty became legendary.
The last queen of Ptolemaic Egypt, and in practical terms, the last Pharaoh of ancient Egypt.
In many works of fiction she is described as a voluptuous beauty who loses herself in love and treats her kingdom as her personal property, but the truth is the exact opposite.
Intelligent and a brilliant economist, she led the militarily inferior Ptolemaic Egypt to become one of the worldâ€™s top economies.
