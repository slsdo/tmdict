The legendary warrior from the Ulster Cycle of Celtic Mythology.
A member of the Red Branch Knights and the strongest warrior of Ulster, he made his name by using the spear techniques taught to him by Sc√°thach, the ruler of the Land of Shadows.
Unlike his usual class, he has materialized as a Berserker.
Some factor has caused his equipment to change, and his personality to be altered as well.
His expression is cruel, his crimson spear has been mixed with black, and is overflowing with an ominous aura.
