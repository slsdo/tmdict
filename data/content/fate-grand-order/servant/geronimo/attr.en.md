Geronimo was a soldier of the Apaches, one of the native tribes of the North American continent.
His name was originally an Apache word for “one who yawns,” but despite this easygoing name his life changed dramatically when he was 20 years old.
When his wife and children were killed by Mexican soldiers, he gave a speech where he vowed vengeance against the Mexican army as a “warrior.”
