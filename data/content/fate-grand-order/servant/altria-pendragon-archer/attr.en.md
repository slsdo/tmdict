The King of the Beach has descended upon the summer ocean. She has left all her kingly duties behind at the office, and has come fully prepared for the summer sunshine. Due to certain circumstances, Altria was unable to enjoy swimming. She entertained herself with watermelon splitting on the beach… Until she met Water Blitz (paintball using water guns). The next thing you know, she looked like this. Since she hates losing, the only goal she has right now is to become the World Champion of this game.

…On that day, she encountered a certain fate (though she does not really care too much).
