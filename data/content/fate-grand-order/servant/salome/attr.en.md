Salome was the adopted daughter of Herod Antipas, who was one of the four tetrarchs that ruled the Galilee and Perea regions. During this period, Israel was under Roman rule, so he was technically an acting governor.

She fell in love with John the Immerser, otherwise known as John the Baptist. Leveraging the fact that her adopted father King Herod was in love with her, she executed a plan to have John all to herself. As King Herod forbade the Baptist from ever setting foot outside his prison, Salome seduced King Herod to convince him to behead Johnâ€¦
And so she gained the head of her beloved.
