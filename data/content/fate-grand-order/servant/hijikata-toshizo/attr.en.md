Hijikata Toshizo, vice commander of the Shinsengumi, the militia group that operated within Kyoto during the Bakumatsu Period.
He ruled his men with an iron grip, and even the genius swordsmen under his command feared him as the Demon Vice Commander.
While he displays the ferocity of a vicious oni on the battlefield, he also possesses keen insight as a strategist, making him rare among Berserkers.
