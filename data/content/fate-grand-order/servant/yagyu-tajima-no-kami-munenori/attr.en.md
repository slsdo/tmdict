One of the strongest swordsman of the Edo Yagyu.
He is the epitome of rationality. Unmoved by emotion, he views the world through a lens of ice-cold logic.
He believes logic and reason to be the path to mastery, and so mastery of the sword makes anything possibleâ€¦
He never speaks of his own passions, and is never impulsive or impatient.
His focus is always on the best, most efficient means of achieving his goal. Cool and steely, he makes both a reliable ally, and an utterly terrifying enemy.
