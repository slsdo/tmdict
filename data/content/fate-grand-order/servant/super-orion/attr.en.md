This Archer is a superhuman who calls himself Greece’s greatest hunter. His fortified and dynamic body enables him to take down any beast, whether he be barehanded or armed with a bow. He is also a hard-core womanizer…but he has lived an amusing…er, pitiful life that’s been full of ups and downs, all because he garnered the affection of, of all beings, the goddess Artemis.
