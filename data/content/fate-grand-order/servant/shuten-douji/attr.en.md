The leader of the oni of Mt. Ooe during the Heian Period.
There are multiple legends surrounding Shuten-Doujiâ€™s origins. Some say she is the child of Ibuki Daimyojin (Yamata-no-Orochi) and a human. Others say she is the heaven-sent child of Mt. Togakushi (Nine-Headed Dragon). Either way, the fact remains that she is a child of a dragon god. She shares a common background with Sakata Kintoki.
