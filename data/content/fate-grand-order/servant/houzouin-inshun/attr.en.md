Thrust with it, and it becomes a spear. Cut with it, and it becomes a scythe. Draw it back, and it becomes a sickle. No matter how it’s used, it never fails to hit its target…
Such is the renowned Houzouin jumonji spear.
Houzouin Inshun is the second generation master of Houzouinryu Soujutsu, and his skill was said to reach the realm of the divine.
