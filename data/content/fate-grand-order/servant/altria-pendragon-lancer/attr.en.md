King Arthur, the legendary King of Knights who ruled over Britain.
A “what if” version of King Arthur who switched her favored armaments after she took the throne. Without the sacred sword’s influence on physical growth, her appearance now matches her age. Although the wielder of the sacred lance will become closer to a Divine Spirit, as she only wielded the lance for 10 years, her psychological and spiritron composition remained about the same.
