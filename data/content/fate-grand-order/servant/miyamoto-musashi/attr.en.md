A swordsman from the early Edo period, famous for being the greatest master of the blade in Japanese history.
Musashi is said to have created “Niten Ichiryu,” and was a master of the two-sword style that used both short and long swords.
…Or so it was thought, but it seems that this Musashi is different from the one known in the history textbooks.

“Eh? Musashi’s a guy in this world? And super-famous? Wow!”

As you can see, this Musashi is a very casual person who doesn’t put on airs.
She’s not interested in victory nor honor, drinks way too much, is exceptionally greedy, and easily swayed by offers of free food.
But those who fight her all say this before they are defeated:

…The flower at the apex of heaven is splendid in color.
Her blade reaches the heights of true nothingness.
