A historical figure from the 10th-11th centuries.
As founder of the Settsu branch of the Genji family, she contributed to the prosperity of the Seiwa Genji family.
Crowned the strongest Mystic Slayer of the Heian period, she has dispatched many demons, such as Shuten-Douji of Mt. Ooe, the Giant Spider of Kyoto, and the Ox-Demon of Sensoji.
Of course, this figure was historically a man. However, the secret of her birth is the reason for the gender change.
She leads four retainers: Watanabe-no-Tsuna, Sakata Kintoki, Urabe-no-Suetake, and Usui Sadamitsu.
