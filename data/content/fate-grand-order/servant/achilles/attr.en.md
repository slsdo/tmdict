One of the best-known heroes of Greek myth.
He swept through life like a swift wind, but at the same time, he had a manner that made him worthy of being called a hero.

His mother once asked him whether he wanted to live an ordinary life of peace and tranquility or die a famed hero. He chose the latter without hesitation.

The Achilles tendon is named for the legend of Achillesâ€™s one and only weakness, as he was otherwise immortal.
