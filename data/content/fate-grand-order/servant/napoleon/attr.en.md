A man of possibilities.
The iconic, ideal hero, formed from the expectations of the people.

The first emperor of France.
He ruled over much of Europe at one point, but his reign ultimately collapsed in the end.
His tempestuous and dramatic life was not solely a result of his personal ambition and ability, but was also influenced by the will of the people. At least, that is how the Throne of Heroes has defined Napoleon the Heroic Spirit.

Thus, the Napoleon that has manifested always acts as a man who answers to someoneâ€™s hopes and desires.
