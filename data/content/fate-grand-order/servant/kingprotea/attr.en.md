The Alter Ego of yearning.
Formerly sealed away as waste at the edge of Void Space, she is a High Servant who was extracted and recreated within the Abyssal Cyber City, SE.RA.PH, just like her fellow Alter Egos Meltryllis and Passionlip. This Alter Ego is a giant capable of growing infinitely, and has the highest output of the entire Sakura series.

Alter Egos are typically an amalgam of several goddesses, and Protea is no exception; she is composed of the essence of the archetypal mother goddess that most mythologies have in common. This even includes Tiamat, the grand mother of ancient Mesopotamia.
