Countess Elisabeth Báthory was the model for the vampire Carmilla. She has now turned into something else completely due to the skill “Innocent Monster.” She also got covered in Halloween attributes by a Grail she picked up by coincidence. What a mess.
She has got the attributes of a dreaming princess who wants to be an idol. Man, she’s got it all.
