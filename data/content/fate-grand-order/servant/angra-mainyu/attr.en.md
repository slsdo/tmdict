This Servant shares his name with the king of destructive spirits in Zoroastrianism, the world’s oldest religion with a dualistic cosmology. Whether he is the real Aŋra Mainiiu is up to his Master to decide.
He specializes in killing humans, but has no other powers beyond that. In a battle between super-powerful beings, like the Holy Grail War, he is of no use whatsoever.
In every sense, he is the weakest Servant.
