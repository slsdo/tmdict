One of the Alter Egos BB created.
The Alter Ego of love and hate.
A girl whose defining characteristics are her large chest and sharp talons. She does not like to fight, but her unique skill “Masochistic Nature” makes her a constant target, and so she has no choice but to fight back.
Among the Alter Egos, she is unmatched in sheer brute strength.
She is the true embodiment of one blinded by love; she embraces her opponents, wrestles them down, and crushes them to her bosom…
Or so it was, but after a fateful encounter, she realized how hollow one-sided love truly is. Having matured into a reserved, kindhearted AI, she tries to conceal her many weapons so as not to harm others around her.
