A young girl who inherited the secret techniques of a certain cemetery. While she is not used to socializing, she works diligently at the Mage’s Association’s Clock Tower as Lord El-Melloi II’s apprentice.

Only a handful of people (El-Melloi II among them), along with a strange talking cube that calls himself Add, know the truth concealed beneath the hood that she wears.
