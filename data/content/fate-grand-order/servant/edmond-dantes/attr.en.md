The world’s most well known seeker of vengeance.
Known as “The Count of Monte Cristo.”
Entrapped by a cruel plot and convicted of a crime he didn’t commit, he was sent to the nightmarish Château d’If. His iron will kept him from falling into despair, and with the treasure of Monte Cristo island in hand he returned to Paris.
There he exacted a terrible revenge upon the city’s most influential people who had betrayed him to become so.
