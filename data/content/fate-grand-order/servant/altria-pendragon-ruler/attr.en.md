Summer Lion King.
That name has three meanings.

1. It belongs to the owner of Casino Camelot, the king of Las Vegasâ€™s many dazzling casinos!
2. It belongs to the host who oversees the Seven Duels of Swordbeauties Championship Match, where contenders must fight with swords in hand, dressed in their best swimsuits, to make wonderful summer memories.
3. It belongs to Lancer Altria, who decided to put on her summer attire.

Also, this Lion King is entirely different from the Lion King of the Sixth Singularity, so try not to get them mixed up.
