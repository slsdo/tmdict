A normal young girl who attends the elementary school division at Homurahara Academy.
She has silver hair, red eyes, and a vaguely aristocratic name.
She claims her absent parents are away on unexplained “business,” and for some reason lives with two maids in her normal residence.
Also, she has an older brother not related to her by blood.
She’s just your typical fifth-grader.
