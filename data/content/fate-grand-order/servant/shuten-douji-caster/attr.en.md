It’s not really clear whether THAT actually existed in the Heian period. Perhaps it was only a rumor that spread among oni living in the shadows of the modern world. Whatever the case, she won’t shut up about it…the legend of the Magifender oni.

The heroes who save the world of man become Heroic Spirits, while those who save the world of oni become Magifenders. Preach to oni, denounce oni, and kill oni… This is the way of the oni Magifender, and the only way to truly save all oni.

“Well, it’s a nice story, so just go along with it, okay?”
