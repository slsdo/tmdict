A young swordswoman whose title comes from the famous Japanese folktale of the “Tongue-Cut Sparrow.” She is also the reliable young owner of the Enma-tei. What’s more, she is also a gallant hostess who never hesitates to nag at those who are lazy, while offering encouragement and the sincerest service to those who are honest.

Her sword-drawing skills are so keen that she can slice off a single layer of skin, and also cut out any tongue that dares speak falsehoods… At least, so the rumors say…

“I will not take your life. But I will not tolerate that deceitful tongue of yours!”
