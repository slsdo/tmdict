One of the most famous leaders of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Despite being the Rani of Jhansi, she took up a sword, rode a horse, and lead her people from the front lines. Her brilliant command of the rebellion’s army earned her praise even from the enemy British commander.

She led her people courageously against the British troops, who were armed with the most advanced weaponry of the time, but died in battle in Gwalior, in June of 1858.

Even after her death, tales of her bravery and strong will have left their mark on people’s hearts to this day.
