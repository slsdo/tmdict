Look to the sky and behold the girl in a swimsuit soaring among the clouds. The mumyou’s light blasting through the skies is…who, exactly?

Her name is Okita J. Souji of the Shinsengumi. This girl uses the mysterious techniques of the Jet Tennen Rishinryu, a sword style from a backwater galaxy. Apparently she flies around Vegas in her jetpack to hunt down outlaws.

“Swimsuit Okita-s…I mean, Okita J. Souji is feeling great! Can’t you tell from my dynamite bod? What? You don’t think the jetpack look works? Oh noooooo!”
