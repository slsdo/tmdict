Astraea chose the most fitting vessel to possess for the goddess of justice and balance. A person who was born to stand above others…

If you believe that premise holds true, she certainly fits the bill. Having accepted that her duty is to wield justice as her Authority, she will never go out of control by claiming it to be her right.

…However, despite her virtuous standard, whenever she comes across anything rare or precious, she has a tendency to think it of utmost importance that it be protected. In other words, she is the most elegant (cunning hyena) even when she is from the heavens.
