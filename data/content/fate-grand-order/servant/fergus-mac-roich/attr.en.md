A warrior found in the Celtic Ulster Cycle.
A member of the Red Branch Knights, he wielded a magical sword, and was also a friend and foster father to the hero CÃº Chulainn.
A man of enormous energy and appetite, he was friendly, never jealous, and never afraid.
The name Fergus remains with us to this day as that of a true hero.
