In Celtic mythology and the Ulster Cycle, there is a great hero who stands above all.
A “Child of Light” born of the blood of the Sun God, Lugh.
Also known as the Guard-Dog, he seems to be the same individual as the Lancer that is summoned with the same True Name.
However, his body and mental age seem to be a bit younger than “the other one.”
