A cool leather jacket.
A trendy hairstyle.
And a shiny, crazy-looking belt buckle.
Gone is any sign of Japanese culture.
The Rider of Lightning, Mr. Golden, the great Sakata Kintoki is here!

“Ya wanna ride with me?
Alright, you zipped up and got your helmet on? ’Cause this lord of lightning is gonna snatch your heart with a speed that’ll take your breath away!”
