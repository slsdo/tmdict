The most famous monk in Japanese history, who earned his fame with Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune.
Even today, he is loved in various stories told through Kabuki and Joruri.
Many phrases stem from him, such as Benkei’s guardian stance (standing firm with feet apart), or Benkei’s Crying Spot (that point below the knee on the calf).
