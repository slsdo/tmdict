And so she transformed into this most unusual Samba-Santa.

“Ay, it seems like I made a tiny mistake, yes…”

But what’s been done can’t be undone.

In her endless positivity, she simply concluded that the two are basically the same, as they both bring smiles to people’s faces, and so resolved to be a goddess who would pass on the gift of happiness to humans everywhere, as she adores them all.

She pours her heart into her samba dances, and into giving gifts to the people of the world…

…and, of course, into Lucha Libre!

Dance, Quetzalcoatl! For everyone’s smiles!
Fight, Quetzalcoatl! For everyone’s peace!
