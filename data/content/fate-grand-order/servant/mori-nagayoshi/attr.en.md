Mori Nagayoshi, a warrior from the Warring States period. He was the son of Mori Yoshinari, the esteemed retainer of the Oda Clan, and his younger brother Mori Naritoshi (Ranmaru) was famous as Oda Nobunaga’s own attendant.
He was a fierce warrior, and using the skills with a spear he inherited from his father (who was dubbed “Sanza the Attacker"), he ultimately earned the nickname “Oni Musashi” for his many military exploits.
