William Tell (aka Wilhelm Tell) is a character from folklore said to have lived in the canton of Uri during the late thirteenth to early fourteenth centuries.

He is best known for the story of having to shoot an apple placed atop his son’s head as punishment of his own failure to bow to the Vogt’s hat, which had been placed upon a pole.

While William Tell is widely known as a character from a play, to the people of Switzerland, he is a hero who symbolizes the foundation of the country and its rebellion against tyranny.
