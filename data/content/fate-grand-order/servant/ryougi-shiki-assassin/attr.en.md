A girl seen in the Irregular Singularity, Boundary Formula.
Clad in a dress blending Japanese and Western style, she speaks in a masculine tone and never hesitates in her actions.
All are considered to be significantly abnormal in a normal world.
Because of her abnormal ability to see death, she has found herself involved in various bizarre incidents and has cut them all down.
Though sheâ€™s completely unaware of the fact, she herself has become an urban legend that roams at night.
