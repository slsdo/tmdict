The Alter Ego of pleasure.
One of the Alter Egos BB created.
She is the Alter Ego focused on pure offense, possessing poisonous nectar capable of melting anything, metal legs able to slice apart all they touch, and a merciless, sadistic personality.
Out of all the Alter Egos that BB created, she has the most balanced abilities, and her drain skill surpasses even BB’s. Because of that, she has little respect for BB, and marked contempt for the other Alter Egos. She is very much aware of the perfection of her form, and so she is extremely prideful.

“Even I think my sadism goes too far sometimes. Kicking the crap out of someone, even if they’re helpless, is honestly such a thrill.”

Her form is, in truth, that of a water queen, but physically she is a young girl who is the most delicate and lovely of all the Alter Egos.
