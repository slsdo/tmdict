A military commander with a story so tragic you could say everyone in Japan knows her name.
Although she was gifted with both talent and charisma, she was abandoned by her brother, Yoritomo, and was defeated along with her retainers including Benkei.
Ushiwakamaru was the childhood name of Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune.
