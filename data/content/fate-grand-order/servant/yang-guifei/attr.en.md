The beautiful imperial concubine whose beauty inflamed the rebellion in the Tang Empire and was said to be the very cause of the dynasty’s ultimate downfall. She is a Foreigner who can at one moment seem the charming girl next door, and the next seem a bewitching princess clamoring for attention. Within her body burns the fire of a malignant god who dwells in the stars…

“I offer my beauty to my nation, my love to His Imperial Majesty, and my heart to my blood relatives. However, my pipa’s melody…the joy of singing and dancing…is the only thing I shall keep for myself.”
