Pulling Caliburn the Sword of Selection out, this is the Altria who just started walking the path of kingship.
Because of such, she’s still a half-boiled knight.
She’s as fresh faced as a lily, and her eyes are filled with glimmering hope.
She walked across the country to experience many things, and left many adventures to tell.
Those saved by her praise her as the Princess Knight from her elegance.
