The niece of the Sengoku period conqueror Oda Nobunaga, she later became the consort of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the child of the sun.
Innocent and insolent, she loves luxury and extravagance in all things. Even the shogun found her to be a handful.
In short, she’s expensive to keep around, but it’s impossible not to be charmed by this flighty princess.
“Now that you understand, there’s something I’d like you to buy for me!”
