A girl discovered within the irregular Singularity, Boundary Formula.
She wears the conservative uniform of a strict girls’ school, speaks in a modest tone, and takes action in an overly bold manner.
Although everything about her is normal, she somehow appears to be a bit off. She possesses the Mystic Eyes of Distortion, which enable her to warp and twist any object she sees, regardless of its rigidity, structure, or size.
It’s said that the Asagami family comes from a long line of shrine maidens who communicated with gods and the supernatural, and the name was once spelled with the Chinese character meaning “deity.”
