A mysterious Servant who showed up in Las Vegas.

No one really knows who she is, but she’s gone out of her way to show off her skills as a first-class ballerina, a goddess of artistry, and even a gifted figure skater. On top of all this, she is also a Servant with the power to control both water and penguins.

More significantly, she is also the owner of Suiten Palace, one of the five major casinos in Vegas. Suiten Palace is known for its incredible slot machines, though rumor has it that the slot machines spin so fast it’s hard to tell what you might be stopping on!

All the customers (Servants) who lose their fortunes in her casino wind up missing. Some say Lambda has captured them and turned them into EXP cards…
