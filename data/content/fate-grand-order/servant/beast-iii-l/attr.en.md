Beast III/L.

While Beast III/R is the embodiment of narcissism who spreads through the universe by directing all love inward to herself, this Beast is the embodiment of loving others by directing love outward toward all mankind to drain the universe.

Kama/Mara may act and talk oppressive, sadistic, and condescending, but no matter who she is, she is still able to “love” as well as being able to twist others into wild sensual madness. Yet this love is not offered for its object’s benefit. Kama/Mara’s Bestial nature comes not from corrupting others by drowning them in love, but by using love itself to corrupt them.
