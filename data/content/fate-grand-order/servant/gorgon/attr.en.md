The youngest of the three Gorgon sisters in Greek mythology.
Her True Name is Medusa.
What remains after a cursed maturation.
For reasons not quite understood, her original monstrous aspects have grown tremendously in power.
She is very close to transforming from a goddess to a pure monster, Gorgon, and should not normally be able to be summoned as a Servant.

───In this state, she is worthy of the title Queen of Demonic Beasts.
