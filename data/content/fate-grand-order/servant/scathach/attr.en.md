A warrior queen from Celtic and Ulster legend.
The Queen and Guardian of Dún Scáith, the “Land of Shadows,” and a prodigy in the arts of spear and runes.
She possesses a power immense enough to rule and close the gate of the “Land of Shadows,” which is overflowing with countless ghosts.
Later she became the mentor of young Cú Chulainn - who would later grow into the hero of Ulster, teaching him all sorts of techniques and even bestowing upon him her beloved spear.
She also taught his son, Connla.
