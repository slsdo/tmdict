One of the most important deities in Aztec mythology in Central America.
A goddess who may seem free-spirited, but is actually kind-hearted and incomprehensibly wise.
She detests sacrificial rituals and loves humans. She is a goddess of life and the harvest, a goddess of culture, and a goddess of rain and wind.
There is a legend that says she even temporarily controlled the sun.

A manifestation (as a Divided Spirit) of an ultimate being.
In this abnormal situation, Quetzalcoatl has appeared wearing a new face that none have seen before, and as a goddess who fell in love with the art displayed by modern Mexico’s Lucha Libre wrestlers - the art of free combat.
…She is not, it’s worth pointing out, worshipped as the goddess of Lucha Libre. She just likes it.
