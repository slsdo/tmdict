As his origin is slightly different than other Heroic Spirits, you cannot call him an official Heroic Spirit.
He is a Guardian, and serves as the defensive system for humanity’s
“collective unconsciousness.”
His very being is humanity’s Counter Force. He is a faceless enforcer of justice chosen by the nameless.
