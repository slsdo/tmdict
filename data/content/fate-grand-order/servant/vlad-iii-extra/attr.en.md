A celebrated hero of Romanian history, he fought to keep Wallachia independent. A warrior of integrity, once called the shield of the Christian world… and an Innocent Monster, known throughout the world by the name of “Dracula.”

To save Wallachia from the Turkish forces, he purged the nobles who had ruined his country, and impaled 20,000 Turkish soldiers on stakes.
But the severity of his punishments turned the nobles against him, and in the end, he was betrayed and assassinated by Wallachian nobility.
