News reached Raikou that morals and decency had been thrown out the window in the southern isles during last year’s summer event.
In order to prevent something like this from happening again this year, she personally prayed to Gozu-Tenno and forced a class change. She may not be as powerful as her Saber self, but she has transformed into Lancer Minamoto-no-Raikou, which has strengthened her desire to protect the capital while restraining her maternal instincts.

“If Raikou were to appear as her proper class, Saber, she’d be totally stern. She’d be a super prefect.”
“But as a Lancer…she’d be the shadow prefect. In other words…”

She’d be a delinquent.
With her maternal aspect held back, Raikou slashes through summer as a gallant warrior out to protect the capital!
