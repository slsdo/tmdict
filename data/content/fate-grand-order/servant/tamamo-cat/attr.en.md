One of the Tamamo Nine.
After Tamamo-no-Mae raised her divinity through thousand-year training, she returned to a one-tailed fox and the other eight tails were cut off.
Each tail gained divinity of their own and became individual souls that could be summoned as Heroic Spirits.
A crystallization of the (rather) pure side of Tamamo-no-Mae.
