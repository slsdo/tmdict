The exploits of Lu Bu, The Flying General, have been chronicled extensively in various tales and histories, chief among them “Records of the Three Kingdoms.” He was a warrior of unparalleled valor and a legendary general who fought ferociously until the moment of his death. It was said that he cut his way through the battlefield astride his favorite horse, Red Hare.

“And now, Lu Bu has merged with Red Hare, his Noble Phantasm and favorite horse… Man and horse, fighting together as one! The centaurs of ancient Greek myth have nothing on me! This manifestation is the perfect union of man, horse, weapon, and armor! The ultimate horse-man warrior!
Indeed, I am Lu Bu. Neeeigh!”

…Neigh.

There is not an ounce of doubt in his passionate words.
