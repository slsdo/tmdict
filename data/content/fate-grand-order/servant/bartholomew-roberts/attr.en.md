Bartholomew Roberts is the great pirate who commanded the largest pirate fleet in history. Contrary to the typical stereotype of an unruly band of pirates, he established a strict code of conduct that prevented internal conflicts and treason. While Bartholomew and his fleet won many a battle, he died fighting against the Royal Navy, which ultimately marked the end of the Golden Age of Pirates.
