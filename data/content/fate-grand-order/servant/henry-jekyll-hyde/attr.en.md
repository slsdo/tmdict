A character from the 19th Century novel “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” or rather, the person whom the character was modeled after.
He attempted to remove the “evil” from his personality, but that evil manifested itself as a personality of its own, eventually committing murder and leading Jekyll to his destruction.
