The god of love in Indian mythology, also called Kamadeva. Originally depicted as a male god. Kama’s manifestation uses an all too familiar girl as a vessel. This is due in part to that girl’s peculiarity, and in part to the presence of another goddess who also appeared as a Pseudo-Servant.

It is said that this god wielded a bow made of sugarcane that shot arrows decorated with flowers. Anybody hit by the arrow is filled with desire.
