Considered to be one of the four great assassins of the Bakumatsu Period, his nickname “Man-slayer Izo” was well-earned. Ono Ittouryu, Kyoushin Meichiryu, and Jikishiryu are just some of the disciplines in which he was trained. After carrying out multiple assassinations, he was eventually captured and executed.
While he can be boastful of his talents and tends to look down upon other swordsmen, his talent with the sword, often described as being “as swift and powerful as a falcon,” was undoubtedly remarkable.
