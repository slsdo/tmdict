A special case that arose within the Mooncell Automaton. Originally a high-grade AI created to monitor the Masters’ health, a bug in the system caused her to go out of control.
As the cancer of the digital world, she rules the far side of the moon. She is the digital demoness who interfered with SE.RA.PH’s Holy Grail War. While she forced the participants of the Grail War to abide by the rules, she herself, being the illegal meddler that she is, broke all the rules.
While she doesn’t bat an eye at the notion of destroying the world, she commits herself to being the best precocious little kouhai to her senpai (Master), wrapping them around her little finger. A devilish heroine.

“Prim and proper battles are so boring, don’t you think? I want to see everyone suffer even more!”

At first blush, her action and personality parameters seem completely out of whack…but that’s just BB for you.
