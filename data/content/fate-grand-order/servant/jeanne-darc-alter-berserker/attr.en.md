“If SHE gets a swimsuit, then I damn well do, too!”

The spell of summer has even overtaken the Dragon Witch. Really, her mind was made up the moment she heard where she would be going next. She pulled an all-nighter poring over travel guides, dog-earing almost every page and meticulously planning the most efficient sightseeing routes for a limited stay. Of course, she also chose the perfect outfit, reminiscent of a Hollywood starlet on an incognito vacation. And with all of that done, she was ready for tropical paradise.

The rogue Heroic Spirit became one of the strongest agents.
A Berserker burning within the dark flames of revenge! She is…Jeanne d’Arc Alter!
