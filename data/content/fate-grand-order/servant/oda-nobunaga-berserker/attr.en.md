The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven by the beach has descended!
Incorporating the latest trends of the summer in Owari, Nobbu has come back looking smart!
“Eh? You’re asking if I’m embarrassed to be wearing a super lame T-shirt?
Heh…I am completely different than the usual me this time around! You won’t believe it, but this summer, I’ve got two whole Ascensions left! That’s right… It’s along-awaited costume-changing Nobbu Ascension!
Don’t you dare buckle your knees after seeing my glorious form after Ascension! 
Uwahahahaha!
…Actually, I think this T-shirt is pretty cool.”
