The summer season has arrived!
“It’s too hot! I’m tiiired! I don’t have any energy!”
Fran, artificial being that she is, can’t handle the summer heat. In search of somewhere cool, she changes into a swimsuit and joins the race!
Her partners are a shady old man and a giant, transforming robo-Babbage.
It’s like a summer blockbuster movie!
