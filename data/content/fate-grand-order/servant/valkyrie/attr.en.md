Warrior maidens clad in armor.
The daughters of the Allfather.
These warriors were manufactured en masse by the god Odin, the highest being in Norse mythology.

They fly over innumerable battlefields, selecting the worthiest souls from among those who had fallen in battle and guiding them to the Allfather’s shining gold palace, Valhalla.
These souls were all gathered to be a part of the Allfather’s army to slaughter the giants, in preparation for the Twilight of the Gods, known as Ragnarök.
