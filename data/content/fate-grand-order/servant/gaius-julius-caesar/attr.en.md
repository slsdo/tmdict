Caesar was one of ancient Rome’s greatest heroes, having shown outstanding prowess as a general during the Gallic Wars, the expeditions to Britannia, and other endeavors.
A playboy and self-proclaimed descendant of the goddess Venus, he supposedly fathered children with both humans and fairies alike. Pronounced “Kai-sahr” in Latin and “See-zar” in English.
