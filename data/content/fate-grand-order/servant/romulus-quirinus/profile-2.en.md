### Bond 2

At times they sever the world, at times they clear the way for civilization…all the while they love humans as only another human can. Should this romantic embrace be likened to a spear, it would be most grand and sharp. An ordinary Spirit Origin would not be enough to contain it all, and only when the Grand title is placed upon the Spirit Origin will they be able to manifest in their true form, which is to say, as a Grand Lancer.

So while they manifest as a normal Lancer under Chaldea’s summoning system, there is little doubt they will remain a most extraordinary being.
