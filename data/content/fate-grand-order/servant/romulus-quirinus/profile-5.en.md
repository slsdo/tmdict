Our Arms Cut Through It All, Taking Us to the Stars.
A great Noble Phantasm that is similar in nature to “Magna Voluisse Magnum” of the Servant sharing the same name. The concept  of developing and expanding civilization has sublimed into a Noble Phantasm.

The arms of romance that sever the world to clear the way for civilization that will eventually reach into the sky itself are like spears of light. And while it’s a manifested depiction of the arrogance of those who control the universe, it’s also an embodiment of the people’s determination to carry on despite an uncertain future.
If this is used as an attack, it will wreak most devastating destruction.
Should this be used for protection or to create something new, it will surely prove even more dazzling…but that is not how it is typically employed in this game.

While it’s downsized, there is a possibility of this being one of the aspects of a nation-building Authority, or even an application for it…at least that’s what Holmes and Da Vinci infer…
