### Bond 3

#### Core of the King of Gods: B+

As the child of Mars, taken along with their being deified as the highest-ranking god within Roman mythology after dying, they possess a Divine Core in their Spirit Origin. Normally it would have been a nonstandard rank, but it has dropped to B+ under Chaldea’s summoning system.

#### Independent Action: B+

Normally, nothing on earth would be able to restraint the highest-ranking god…but Romulus=Quirinus has purposefully lowered their rank.

#### Throne of Quirinus: EX

Meant for the highest deity of all mythological systems, as well as the deity who governs the entire world of the Mediterranean Sea, this skill has converted Imperial Privilege, and under normal circumstances it should represent various different Authorities. However, this is typically not used as an Authority in this game.

#### Divinity Transformation: B

The Natural Body skill that has been altered along with the Spirit Origin. A representation that Romulus, though born as human, ascended to become a deity.
