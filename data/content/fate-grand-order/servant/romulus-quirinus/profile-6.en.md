### Clear Main Quest 「The Journey Continues」

The nation-building hero Romulus who was previously bound by human limitations has now revealed their aspect as a god. Normally there is no possibility for a Divine Spirit to be summoned with a Grand Spirit Origin. However, the fact that they were deeply involved with human history and, in a most unusual exception, were elevated into a supreme god despite being human, were the miracles what enabled them to be summoned as a Grand Lancer in the Fifth Lostbelt.

In the Fifth Lostbelt, many of humanity’s Heroic Spirits attempted to go up against Zeus, the Lostbelt King, but they were wiped out entirely. Entrusting their final hope to Chaldea, knowing that they would soon arrive, the Heroic Spirits gathered the last of their strength and left a grand plan behind to survive them.

And so, “Operation God Destroyer” was conceived, leading to the summoning of Romulus=Quirinus, a Heroic Spirit/Divine Spirit who was on the side of humanity, and possessed a human aspect while simultaneously being the supreme god of myth, as well as power equivalent to the thunderbolt wielded by Zeus, the Greek king of gods.

With the arrival of Chaldea, Operation God Destroyer came to fruition. When Romulus=Quirinus manifested in the Lostbelt, they fought alongside Chaldea to successfully defeat the swarm of Olympus’s divine mechs.

When the mechanical gods were destroyed, Romulus=Quirinus disappeared along with them, and it was thought that they would never manifest ever again… But the bonds they formed with Master, combined with the Spirit Origin registering on to the Trismegistus in Novum Chaldea, enabled their Spirit Origin to be summonable without the Grand title. With their summoning, they can once again wield their arms like shining spears in defense of humanity.
