Rome is, in its essence, “romance”…
As if to symbolize this, after the Age of Gods, this man attained a sense of humanity and the ability to love his fellow humans.

The young Romulus, who would become the great founder of the nation of Rome, was born to the war god Mars and the beautiful princess Silvia. He was raised among wild beasts. Here, his youthful self has been combined with Quirinus, one of the three highest-ranking Roman deities.

This being is worshipped as a god, and his manifestation emphasizes the brutal aspect of the rapid expansion associated with ancient Rome. Just like the Heroic Spirit of the same name who symbolizes rule and prosperity, he epitomizes the possibilities for humanity as it leaves the Age of Gods behind.
