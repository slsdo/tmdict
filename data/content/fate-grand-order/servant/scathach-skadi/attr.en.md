A Servant, originally from the Scandinavian Lostbelt, who is completely separate from the Scáthach of Proper Human History. She is recognized as a god only in the Lostbelt, and her aspect as a queen is emphasized.

Scáthach-Skadi manifests many characteristics of Skadi, the Norse giantess and goddess of the mountains who shares an origin with the Celtic warrior Scáthach. Rather than seeing her as a version of Scáthach in whom aspects of Skadi are prominent, it may be more correct to say that she is Skadi who possesses certain of Scáthach’s attributes.
