Sacred Boundary.
A defensive armament created by the gods of Olympus. It is said to be armor or shield, and an extraordinary powerful bounded field, a conceptual defense mechanism of divine creation. However, Odysseus is able to don it as a physical armor, likely thanks to Athena’s deep affection for him, granting him an invincible suit of armor made of divine steel, possessing conceptual defenses.

A Noble Phantasm that is always active, it is expressed as a skill in this game.
