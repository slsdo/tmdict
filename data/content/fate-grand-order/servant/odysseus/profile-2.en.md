### Bond 2

A man with an unwavering will, a hero of the Trojan War, and one of the greatest adventurers in Greek mythology. He went on numerous adventures and overcame countless adversaries, and there is no question of why his name became the basis for the word “odyssey.”

Even were he boasting, he could back up his claims.
If he says he’ll take down Troy, that is what he’ll do.
If he says he’ll flee from a scene of carnage, that is what he’ll do.
If he says he’ll defeat monsters and Demonic Beasts, that is what he’ll do.
And if he says he’ll head home to reach his beloved Penelope, that is what he’ll do…one day.
