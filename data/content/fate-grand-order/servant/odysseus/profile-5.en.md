Great Horse of Demise.
Near the end of the Trojan War, Odysseus arranged for a large wooden horse that would be brought within the impregnable walls of Troy, hiding numerous Greek soldiers (Achaeans) within this “offering.” Ultimately, the Trojans brought their enemies inside, and were defeated by getting in the resulting ambush, leading to the Achaean army’s victory. According to literature, it was said that Odysseus was among those inside the wooden horse, and that he fought alongside these warriors.

The Noble Phantasm’s wooden horse is in fact a giant mount covered in divine steel  armor that suggests it has the blessings of the Aegis thanks to Athena. After its True Name is revealed, the wooden horse becomes a titanic being that annihilates everything around it in a demonstration of the fierceness of the Trojan War.
