The protagonist of Homer’s famed epic “The Odyssey.” His role in the Trojan War is recorded in “The Iliad.”

Odysseus was the Achaeans’ greatest strategist during the Trojan War. Following the death of Achilles, it was Odysseus who came up with the idea for the Trojan Horse, which directly led to the fall of Troy.

After the war, he sailed for home to return to his beloved Penelope. His journey was complicated by many obstacles, among which were: a vicious cyclops, Poseidon’s curse, temptation at the hands of Circe the witch and Calypso the nymph, the enchanting song of the sirens, the dread monster Scylla, the wrath of the sun god Helios, and myriad other hardships. Eventually, though not without sacrifice, Odysseus overcame these many trials and made it home.

“The weight and hardship of a single step forward… I understand that, to a degree.”
