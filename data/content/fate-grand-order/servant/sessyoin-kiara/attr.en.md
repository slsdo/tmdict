The nemesis of the Enlightened One.
A saint who appeared in the Abyssal Cyber Paradise, SE.RA.PH.
As the true savior, she took all of paradise’s resources for herself, and was reborn as something beyond human.
However, her plans and her wishes all fell to ruin at the very last moment.
In that instant, Kiara herself disappeared, but it seemed that she had a change of heart as she did, and left a portion of her power behind to coalesce into an Alter Ego with the hope that she would be summoned to Chaldea as a force for good.

“Chaldea is nice.
 One can commit their being to battle in various ages and places…
I would like to taste that for myself.”

This she claims smilingly, modestly. But her true intentions are obviously quite apart from the good of humanity.
She may be calmer now, but her nature has not changed at all. Be wary of her.
