Tawara Touta was a general from mid-Heian period who was revered as the founder of martial arts in eastern Japan.
Later named as Fujiwara-no-Hidesato, he found sudden fame by defeating Taira-no-Masakado.
It is said that he defeated a giant centipede large enough to make seven and a half turns around a mountain with just his bow and arrows.
