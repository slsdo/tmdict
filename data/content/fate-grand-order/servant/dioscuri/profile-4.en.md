### Bond 4

#### Core of the Twin Gods: B

A skill possessed by both twins.
Normally, the skill should be at least rank A or nonstandard because of their status as ancient twin deities, but the Greek myth of the Gemini that later became so widespread caused the skill to instead manifest at rank B. This also likely happened because later tellings specified that Castor lacked divine blood.

#### Star of the King of the Gods: A

A skill that represents the two individuals merging into a single entity and becoming a constellation.

#### Guardian of Sea Voyagers: B

Protects those who travel on ships.
The twins’ presence rouses those about them, instilling them with hope and determination to overcome the challenges facing them. It is similar to Voyager of the Storm, and originally was a compound skill that included Tactics and Charisma.

#### Mana Burst (Light/Ancient): A

The twin deities are said to be the very representation of St. Elmo’s fire, the strange light sometimes observed at sea. This is quite unlike the pseudo-Mana Burst many saintly Servants possess. Magical energy is discharged as light, and increases the target’s combat strength.
