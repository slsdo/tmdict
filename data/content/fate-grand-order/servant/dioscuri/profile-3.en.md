### Bond 3

As they are already ancient Divine Spirits, the Gemini possess a unique characteristic upon their manifestation: while being a single entity, they retain two separate bodies, and each of their bodies retains the attributes of a different class.

The elder brother, Castor, who was not the child of Zeus, harbors bitter resentment for the gods who led humans to ruin. He possesses the characteristics of an Avenger. The younger sister, Pollux, Zeus’s immortal daughter, is a Saber who leverages her invincible physique to facilitate her indefatigable application of her masterful sword work.

While the Gemini’s Spirit Origin is registered as a Saber because of their nature as a single entity, they function as a dual-class Servant. This unique characteristic was likely allowed because they are a Divine Spirit Servant.
