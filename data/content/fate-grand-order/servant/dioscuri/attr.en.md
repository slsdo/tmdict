Once there was a set of twins (Dioscuri) who ascended to the heavens to become the shining constellation Gemini…

The name Dioscuri means “children of Zeus.”

According to the “Catasterismi,” written around the 3rd century B.C., the constellation Gemini was known as Dioscures, consisting of Castor and Pollux. The two appeared in the land of Laconia (the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula) and later ascended to the heavens. It is said that the loving bond these siblings shared was unparalleled.

To immortalize the siblings’ closeness, Zeus, king of the gods, combined stars from two independent constellations into a new constellation known as “the Twins.”
