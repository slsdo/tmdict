Poetic Praise of the Twin Gods.
Power that combines Pollux’s skilled swordsmanship with Castor’s rage against the gods for the devastation they cause. It is a most devastating combined attack the twins unleash. This attack is made possible by the coordination born from the twins’ implicit trust in each other, and so has become their Noble Phantasm.

Additionally, when its True Name is revealed, the two almost completely regain their Divinity from their time as ancient deities, temporarily elevating this attribute to its maximum rank. Because this attack utilizes the near-perfect magical energy of a Divine Spirit, it ignores various physical and magecraft-based defenses, utterly obliterating its target.
