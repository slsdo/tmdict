### Clear Main Quest 「The Journey Continues」

The Gemini materialized as a deity at the time of the Fifth Lostbelt’s inception. However, they were defeated in their battle against Kirschtaria Wodime, and after temporarily losing their life, they formed a contract with Kirschtaria as a Lostbelt Servant. By forming a contract, Castor learned of the version of their legend native to Proper Human History. Though the myth was from Proper Human history, Castor could not help but harbor a tremendous hatred to humanity for what he saw as their looking down upon him. Pollux, too, shared that hatred after learning what her brother was made to experience.

Consequently, both siblings came to be dominated by their hatred of humanity, leading to their brutal violence toward Chaldea and the citizens of Olympus.

On the other hand, the twins who were summoned to Chaldea as Servants of Proper Human History are not so violent as the twin deities of the Lostbelt. Even though Castor possesses requisite mentality to establish his Spirit Origin as an Avenger, his younger sister Pollux’s more calm and demure personality than that of her Lostbelt Servant equivalent is able to placate the older brother’s wrath. You can mostly ignore the older brother…up to a point.
