### Bond 2

Originally the Dioscuri were ancient twin gods that took the form of young horsemen, or even horses themselves. They were said to be saviors of humans who were in danger, such as those in battle or at sea. The twin gods were long referred to as “the two gods,” without individual names. The names Kastor (Castor) and Polydeukes (Pollux) were first recorded in the “Homeric Hymns,” a collection of hymns praising the gods composed during Homer’s era.

They bore the title “Anakes,” which means “lords” or “kings.” In later ages, they were regarded more as guardians of sailors thanks to their appearance as members of the Argo’s crew in the “Argonautica.” The flash of light that discharges from ships’ masts during storms, known as St. Elmo’s fire, was believed to be the twins manifesting to guide ships at sea.
