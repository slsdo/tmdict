Paris is the younger brother of Hektor, the Trojan Hero and one of the Nine Worthies. Paris stole King Menelaus’s wife Helen (admittedly, she had been promised to him by a goddess), which started the Trojan War.

Paris bravely fought alongside Hektor, and he continued on after Hektor’s death, even fatally wounding Achilles.
