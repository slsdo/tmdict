Thomas Alva Edison is an American inventor. Born in the 19th century, he is one of the most famous people in the world, but since his existence is closer to modern times, he is weaker compared to other Servants.
To make up for this weakness, the generations of presidents that supported the nation called the United States of America have been utilized in a form of Mystic Code to strengthen the concept called “Edison.”
