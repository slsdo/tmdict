A faceless, nameless, chivalrous thief.
As he says himself, this young man is only one of the many “someones” that fit under the description of Robin Hood. 
The original legend is of the chivalrous thief hiding in Sherwood Forest.
Originally Robin Hood stood against the tyrant John Lackland, but it is said he bled to death in the Kirkless Monastery due to a conspiracy involving the abbess.
