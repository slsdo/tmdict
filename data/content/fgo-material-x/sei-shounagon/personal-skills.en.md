### Immortal’s Poetry: B

Despite being listed among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets and the Thirty-Six Immortal Poetesses, and having one of her pieces published in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, Sei Shounagon dismisses herself as an unskilled poet.
Her distaste for it potentially comes from the incompatibilities of waka poetry’s antiquated ruleset and her forward-thinking sensitivities.
Regardless, her poetry often hit the hearts of its readers, and often were used to boldly turn away rude men.
Murasaki Shikibu has a Skill with the same name and rank, but completely different in content. That’s a great point of interest to evaluate the differences in the two’s personalities. Maybe.

### Ousaka’s Gateway: A

A rooster’s crow may open the Hangu Pass gateways, but the checkpoint of the heart is not one to open its gates as easily.
Who shall be the first to cross her impregnable Ousaka Gateway{{n1}}?

### The Best Stars: B

The darker the night is, the brighter the stars shine.
Pleiades, Altair, Vesper, shooting stars…{{n2}}
And her light is also like a star.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} This one is about her poem in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu.
2. {{note2}} From a short Pillow Book entry: “The best stars are the Pleiades, Altair, and Vesper. Comets also have their charm, but could be improved from not having the long trail behind them.”
