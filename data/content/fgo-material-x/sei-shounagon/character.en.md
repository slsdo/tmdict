### Personality

A good-humored girl always finding something to enjoy… until she gets disgruntled when you least expect it.
A rare breed: the party animal Servant. Whimsical as a cat, always spreading mayhem, and prioritizing fun above all else.
A radiating lady far ahead of her time. Someone who loves okashige{{n1}} (or in modern terms, the feels) above all else.
She’s very different from what one would expect of a renowned poet, presumably as a consequence of her excessive affinity with modern youth culture.
Her taking the form of a high schooler on summon makes sense with the historical facts, as it’s known she was very concerned about being too old for job in the Teishi Salon.

It’s important to note that while the body she manisfets with as a Servant is on her late teens, her appearance remains young as ever in Hell Mandala for whatever reason.
The Singularity is set in Heian, the fiend-ridden capital where anyone can turn into a specter. Perhaps she also suffered something similar to the strange phenomenon that assailed her brother Munenobu (that’s probably not it).

Shounagon is a title, not a name.
The tradition of time was that court ladies would have office names containing the rank of their fathers or husbands in the Department of State, but she didn’t have any relative ranked Shounagon.
It’s presumed she’s called that because Teishi found the idea amusing.
Nagiko might consider the act of nicknaming to be a proof of affection… or maybe not, we don’t know.

On an unrelated tangent, she became great friends with Murasaki Shikibu in Chaldea (her own opinion, up for debate).

### Attitude towards Master

Sei Shounagon believes her role is finished since she completed The Pillow Book.
Her life after that, including her summon, is past her peak.
Still, life is intriguing in its unpredictability.
When she and her Master build a relationship based on trust and friendship, not restrained by the Master-Servant roles, she might one day pick up the pen again and write a new book.

### Dialogue Examples

Let’s get this ball rolling, chan-Mas!
What I dislike? Hah, the list gets long. But, check out this life hack: if I focus only on what I like, I can’t remember any of that. What about you, chan-Mas? Aren’t you letting too many dislikes live rent-free in your head?
Sei Shounagon’s role was over when The Pillow Book ended. You’re talking to her dregs right now. I’m only Nagiko. An essayist who loved Empress Teishi.
Young people, stay happy! Yesterday’s smile can overwrite today’s sadness and connect you to a brand new tomorrow! Overwrite the world, Pillow Book! Emotional Engine: Full Drive!
Great job, team, we killed Selinuntus.{{n2}}

### Historical Image · Character Image

A Heian novelist and poet.
She’s the daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke, one of the Five Men of the Pear Chamber responsible for the Chinese-to-Japanese translation work in the Man’youshuu.
She grew familiar with Chinese grammar and poetry, which was considered something only men learned. Many incidents proved she was a woman who broke the female mold of her time, as her vast knowledge allowed her to talk back to men and win the argument.
She’s often considered Murasaki Shikibu’s rival but there was a 5 year gap between Shounagon leaving and Shikibu entering the imperial court. It’s believed the two of them never seen each other.
But the possibility that they crossed paths at least once can’t be discarded.
That’s because the famed Diary of Lady Murasaki described Sei Shounagon as if Murasaki personally knew her.

In her late 20s, she started working as a lady-in-waiting for Empress Teishi, the consort of Emperor Ichijou.
The young Teishi was very affectionate toward this “Shounagon” a whole 12 years older than her, and her Shounagon, in turn, constantly tried to live up to the beautiful and witty Teishi’s expectations.
She wrote down all the humorous and intriguing events of her court life, and compiled them into one prose essay anthology.
That was Japan’s first essay book: The Pillow Book

<>

The Pillow Book tells of her happy and extravagant days, but its writting only started when Teishi and her Naka-no-Kanpaku family were suffering their political collapse.
Sei Shounagon’s prose was penned with the express purpose of reminding her lady of the glory days. To encourage Teishi when the oppressive circumstances weighted heavy on her heart.
It had no need for memories of their sad and painful pasts, nor worries for their dark and challenging future.
Despite being dedicated to Teishi, this literary work continued after her death, later allowing The Pillow Book to see its completion.
Nowadays this anthology is sometimes dismissed as simply Sei Shounagon’s bragging, but in reality, it’s a piece brimming with love and admiration for her dear lady Empress Teishi.
The Pillow Book’s portrayal of the Teishi Salon of the olden days became a topic of debate among the future generations, making it so that the life of the girl named Fujiwara no Teishi remained vivid in public consciouness to this day.

Sei Shounagon left the court after Empress Teishi’s death. The records on her life after this event are fragmentary at best, but there are multiple fictional “Sei myths” created with the intention of humiliating her for being too clever for a woman (for example, the famous factoid about her exposing her crotch to get away from an assassination attemption was first mentioned 200 years after her time in the court).
On the other hand, a prevalent theory is that she made a new home next to the Toribeno Mausoleum, Teishi’s resting place, and lived a quiet life in her remaining years.
Whatever the truth is, it’s honestly none of our business.

### Character Image

She debuted in the 2020 event Not-So-Ordinary Valentines.
Nagiko, as she called herself, was actually an irregular entity summoned as a counter to the Sei Shounagon created by the Holy Grail based on Murasaki Shikibu’s imagination.

Logically, she’s most qualified for the Caster Class like the rest of the writers, but against everyone’s expectations, the imperfect Grail summoned her in the Archer Class.

<>

She is no longer Sei Shounagon, as she offered both that name and The Pillow Book as a tribute to let the lady she served in life, Empress Teishi, rest in peace.
She chose to abandon her wish for revenge, and to never forget her splendid life, always carrying one lone star inside her heart.
This meant another star dying out.
By leaving the court and never making any public appearance again, she died quietly and in peace as just “Nagiko”.
She was too human to become a guardian of Human Order.

But this irregular summon was a turning point for Sei Shounagon.
In the days she spent in the Singularity pretending to be the ordinary wanderer Nagiko, the dregs of who she once where, she went through many new experiences and established emotional bonds with trustworthy people. This both broke the seal locking her poet identity and filled her with new potential. That’s when she finally joined the Throne of Heroes.

As such, she was summoned.
Even if he/she is yet to experience those bustling days with “Nagiko”, Sei Shounagon is eager to see the day she meets him/her again.

### Rokujou

The broken Holy Grail created an imaginary Sei Shounagon built from Murasaki Shikibu’s subconsciousness. A misinterpretation given form.
A narcisistic woman with a smug face and self-important attitude, who thinks she’s oh so clever despite never getting anything right.
In that micro-Singularity where all present were distorted into The Tale of Genji characters, she named herself after Rokujou no Miyasundokoro and appeared by the end of the story.

She carried a powerful grudge against Murasaki Shikibu, Fujiwara no Shoushi, and Fujiwara no Michinaga, but (the real) Sei Shounagon of all people barged in to purify her, resulting in her complete annihilation.
“Are you freaking kidding me!?”

<>

For reference, Rokujou no Miyasundokoro is a character in Hollyhock, the ninth chapter of The Tale of Genji.
She was a terrifying and pitiful woman, so consumed by envy that she transformed into a living ghost and killed Aoi no Ue by possessing her.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Okashige, most commonly seen in its adjective form “okashi”, is the concept of beauty as portrayed by Sei Shounagon’s writing. It proposes cheerful, intellectual, and guttural sentimentality, as opposed to the subdued atmosphere of elegant melancholy prevalent in, say, Murasaki Shikibu’s works. Uncoincidently, Type-Moon web designer and assistant writer OKSG names himself after okashige.
2. {{note2}} “Run, Melos!” is a short story by Osamu Dazai where Melos is given the sunset as a time limit to save his friend Selinuntus’s life. Servant Summer Camp’s bonus Gudaguda scene involves Nagiko’s party getting lost in the woods, and when the sun sets, she drops this line as a reference none of the other Servants get.
