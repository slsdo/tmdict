### Magic Resistance: C

Negates spells with a chant of two verses or less.
Cannot defend against something more complex, like high magecraft or ritual curses.

### Independent Action (Self-Centered): A

Goes out to have a good time even when her Master is absent.
“Right, let’s go to Kyoto.”
However, she needs her Master’s backup for things that demand vast amounts of magical energy, such as using her Noble Phantasm.

### Snow on Xianglu Peak: A

In one snowy day, Sei Shounagon’s lady, Empress Teishi, asked her what the snow was like atop China’s Xianglu Peak. Bai Jiyu’s poem read “One must open the bamboo blinds to see the snow on Xianglu Peak”, so in reference to it, she raised her lady’s blinds high, displaying the snow in her garden.
Sei Shounagon’s knack for ascertaining the true essence of every situation often produces a decisive strike.

### Law of Ekanaya: A

The Lotus Sutra defines the Law of Ekanaya as an allegory to the idea of being the one and only.
Sei Shounagon’s single-minded feelings toward her lady repels all forms of tentation that comes her way.
Sei Shounagon famously used the Law of Ekayana as a metaphor for her views on romance. She strived to be the number one in the heart of her partner, and wouldn’t accept being number two or three, but in front of Teishi, she lost all her previous backbone and timidly said:
“For your affection, I could accept being any number.”.
The very lady she cared for scold her for this comment.
“Listen here, you need to learn to commit to what you say.”
How beautiful that was.
