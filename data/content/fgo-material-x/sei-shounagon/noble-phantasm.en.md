A singular mental state achieved not through martial arts or onmyou techniques, but through constant penmanship.
The imagined landscape of her Pillow Book materialized in the real world when the waves of her emotions take over.
In other words, a Reality Marble.

Sei Shounagon rewrites the world into nostalgic sceneries that the opponents engulfed within her boundaries once saw, corroding their hearts.
Sorrow, nostagia, poignancy… If the whirl of powerful emotion throws them into enough disarray to forget their battle even for a moment, they will be unable to avoid the powerful (and unfair) attack of the owner of this domain.

“All that is radiating and heartthrobbing remains eternal long after the flesh withers! It shall endlessly continue to be! Emotional Engine: Full Drive!”

Side note: “The Pillow Book: Spring Dawn Commentary” is the title of an commented edition produced by Kitamura Kigin in the Edo period. Sei Shounagon was delighted to know that her published emotions withstood the test of time and were loved by people of future eras. She took the name “Spring Dawn Edition” as a title that symbolized the connection of past and future, and also elevated that into her Noble Phantasm subtitle as a term that perfectly encapsulates the nature of her Noble Phantasm as commentary on her “In spring, the dawn” verse.
