Vulcano Caligorante
A net that is said to have the ability to capture even gods, set by the giant Caligorante. At least that was what it was supposed to be, but Caligorante hears the trumpet of Astolfo’s magical horn and flees in fear, ironically falling into his own net.
After far too many complications to note here, the net was reforged into a sword when Astolfo became a Saber. The blade is also known as a whip-sword or a chain-linked sword, which is the dream of all warriors (confirmed).

Crazy Trip Drive Idol
Something that calls upon the Hippogriff’s power when summoned as a Rider. It’s everywhere yet nowhere, and its imaginary existence confuses the enemy. In this particular case, Astolfo not only creates many clones, but also creates uncertainty about whether they are truly there or not, enabling a form of evasion. For some Servants seeing Astolfo multiply in number is a nightmare (Not used in FateGO)
