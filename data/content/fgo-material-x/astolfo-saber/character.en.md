### Personality

Astolfo’s alignment remains Chaotic-Good, so if you really think about it, it’s still the same Astolfo, just carrying a sword. While at essence a Rider, Astolfo has abilities that are slightly improved due to wielding a sword.

As a Saber, Astolfo’s knightliness seems to have increased, which allows for about a five percent increase in politeness and sanity retention for about five seconds longer. It also means bowing five degrees lower and gripping your hand five times firmer when shaking it as well.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Astolfo has become a bit more respectful than they were as a rider and now behaves like a real knight.

Astolfo has no real wish for the Holy Grail now that their wish to become a Saber has been granted so, as long as their master is not too unscrupulous, they’ll probably be fine (There is a high chance of getting into trouble)

### Dialogue Examples

I am your sword!
Merry Christmas! I’m Astolfo, but I’m different from the Astolfo who thinks they’re Santa! Do you think I’m having an identity crisis?
Even bunnies who stare up at the moon sometimes lose their reason! It’s time to catch the violent giant and march onward! Let’s go! Vulcano Caligorante!

### Historical Image · Character Image

The same as Astolfo (Rider)

### Character Image in “FateGO”

It all started during the 2021 Christmas event. After Astolfo took the wish-granting device, the Holy Grail (bell), from Nightingale, their subconscious desire to become a Saber was inadvertently granted.

But once Nightingale obtained the Holy Grail, Astolfo lost the power of a Saber. Feeling sorry for Astolfo, Nightingale turned them back to a Saber, and thus Astolfo Saber was officially born. Perhaps not surprisingly, the first thing Astolfo wanted to do the moment they turned back into a Saber was to shout the following to Master:

“I am your sword!”

They really wanted to say that with their head held high as a Saber. Yeah…that’s pretty much their entire motivation for becoming a Saber in the first place.

### Connections with Characters

#### Nightingale (Archer)

Thank You x 100

#### Bradamante

Hey, did you see that Bra-chan? Isn’t it cool? Eh? “Aren’t you the same as usual A-chan?” That means I’m always cool!

#### Roland

I don’t think it’s a good idea to bite your handkerchief out of frustration. I mean, what’s with that mean-girl like behaviour?

#### Charlemagne

Hey look Char I’m a king too. Oh oh oh. I’m a Saber too It’s cool right! Right. Ha ha ha!

#### Sei Shonagon

It not like they have particularly deep conversations but when these two meet up, in the cafeteria for example, it is not just at the level of being loud, they are pretty much noise pollution
