Actually, the original design of Saber Astolfo existed before the start of FGO! (BANG!!!) I don’t remember why though! Even designers don’t have good sense and memory! (Anyway) My personal theme was to fill the figure with KAWAII, and to keep the shared parts as much as possible in each form, while changing the impression with the main part in the center. The tail part on the back side is a charm point! I want to pull it! (Ototsugu Konoe)
