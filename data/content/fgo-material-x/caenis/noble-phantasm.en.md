### Lapith Caeneus: Soar, My Great Golden Wings

An Anti-Army Noble Phantasm that has Caenis’ very own existence sublimated as a Noble Phantasm. They carry out a metamorphosis into “a bird that has golden wings” that they transformed into on the occasion of their death, and they cause damage to the enemy camp by charging into it while flying.

An absolute defense that is accompanied by the nature of immortality. A Conceptual Defense. It is primarily a Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type.

A blessing granted to Caenis during the occasion where, after her virginity was forcefully taken away from her by the Sea God Poseidon, she transformed into a man in accordance with her wish. An invulnerable body that can stay unscathed even if it was stabbed or cut and can make Caenis ignore iron blades. It even nullifies every weaponry-based attack made on Caenis, but it cannot nullify wide surface attacks done with a large mass or an enormous energy behind it. (It also cannot nullify the entire damage from an attack equal to or greater than an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm.)

As a secondary effect, it is possible for Caenis to exercise the Authority to cross over the seas. Due to this, they can even cross over into a Lostbelt.

### Poseidon’s Maelstrom: The God of the Sea’s Great Raging Tidal Wave

Caenis pulverizes their target(s) by means of a super-massively large ocean current, and there is no difference whether the target(s) is on the ground or mid-air in the function of this attack. It is a powerful Offensive Noble Phantasm even under normal circumstances like described above, but if it is a situation where the target(s) is on water, underwater, or is close to a large quantity of water, the attack’s power will increase even more. It is a limited reproduction of a very small fraction of the Authority over Oceans that the Sea God Poseidon possesses, and it is primarily regarded as something that has an extremely large area of effect equal to, or possibly greater than, an Anti-Country Noble Phantasm.
