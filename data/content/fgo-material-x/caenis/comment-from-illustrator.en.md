Caenis was the first Servant for me where I was able to accept the responsibility of a character’s design in FGO, so I was up to the task of creating their design while being all the more excited. There were also a lot of things that I was of two minds over about when I was designing them, and there were a large number of drafts that ended up being rejected. I thought, ‘Heeey, I would be delighted if there is an opportunity to show these someday.’ Cheers for tanned skin, hurray!! (Azusa)
