I was contacted for the Requiem collab happened not long after Requiem went on sale, so I was very taken aback, but also did a little happy dance. I wanted Voyager's Ascension designs to really touch people, so I took great care in making them. His second Ascension is in the style of a certain Prince, while his third is a mix of motifs from space suits + flight jackets with Voyager being a slightly more matured traveler. (NOCO)
