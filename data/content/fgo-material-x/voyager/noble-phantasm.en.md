Pale Blue Dot.
A faint, tiny light Voyager barely saw when he turned around to look after travelling six billion kilometers. The thoughts of the people who sent him out into the unknown…all of their hopes and dreams for the future live in that tiny 0.12 pixel photo. And as he continues on his journey, the warm wind blows his golden sails.
Representing mankind’s possibilities and hidden hopes, this strongly encourages his allies while lessening his enemies’ will to fight.
