### Existence Outside the Domain: C

In contrast to Foreigners gaining this skill as emissaries of Outer Gods, this still is suitably granted for one who is a man-made vessel who embarked into space as an envoy.

### Independent Navigation: A

A skill equal to Independent Action. A skill originating from Voyagerâ€™s main class of Voyager, where it is rank EX.

### Civilization Contact: D

Another skill originating form his original class that can be called a friendly version of Civilization Erosion. It is hoped that one day, this shoddy skill will prove quite useful.
