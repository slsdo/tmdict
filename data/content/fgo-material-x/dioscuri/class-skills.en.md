### Mad Enhancement: B-

A skill possessed by the sister, Pollux.
Mutual communication is possible, but the parameter-increasing effect has been limited.
However, if her brother is severely wounded, she will fly into a frenzy and be almost impossible to communicate with, becoming the very incarnation of aggression.

### Magic Resistance: A

As a Saber, it’s natural that Pollux has a high Magic Resistance rank.

### Riding: B

Pollux has talents in the Riding skill, due to being a Saber.

### Avenger: B

As Castor, the brother, is an Avenger, he has this Avenger skill naturally.
It is a skill that symbolises his vengeful desires against humans.

### Oblivion Correction: C

Brother Castor has the Oblivion Correction skill due to being an Avenger.
He will never forget that he is, himself, a fallen god.

### Self-Recovery (Magical Energy): D

As an Avenger, it’s natural that Castor holds the skill of Self-Recovery.

### Divine Core of the Twin Gods: B

A skill possessed by both twins.
Ordinarily, due to being ancient twin gods, the rank should be A, or even non-standard, but due to the influence of the twin’s legend within the Grecian mythology that took form in later years, it stops at B-rank.
In particular, it is likely because later versions of the legends considered the fact that “Castor has no divine blood” in their tellings.
