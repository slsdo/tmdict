### Personality

#### Castor

The twin brother.

Although he was an ancient Divine Spirit, according to the legends from after his time, he did not carry the blood of the Chief God Zeus, and was denigrated to being a human hero. When summoned as a Servant, he conducts himself as if he were a Divine Spirit, but despite that, he is quietly filled with the indignation over the fact of human history causing him to fall to such ruin.
The target of his fury is the entire world. Humans and gods alike are the targets for his revenge.
… However, as he has materialised alongside his sister, who he cherishes above all others, he continues to admonish himself away from unleashing all of his rage.

#### Pollux

The twin sister.
She is an ancient deity, and even in the legends after her time, she was said to carry the blood of the Chief God Zeus, and so she possessed an immortal body. Manifested as a Servant, that immortality is expressed in the form of her supreme rank in the Endurance parameter.
In both word and deed, she is relatively blunt with her older brother, but truthfully, she loves and respects him profoundly. According to legend, when her brother died, Pollux’s grief was so profound that she prayed to the heavens to never again be parted from her brother.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The brother will never trust a human Master.
The sister acknowledges that their Master continues on an arduous journey, not dissimilar to a voyage through a storm, and vows to safeguard that journey.
“I suppose it can’t be avoided, then” says the reluctant brother, respecting his sister’s principles.

C: “Then may the human world perish!”
P: “I can’t allow that. We shall not let it die.
C: “……”

P: “I didn’t know the bold heroes of the Argo would be here. It’s a bit nostalgic.
C: “That’s─── Well, I suppose.”

P: “Die. Those who harm Brother shall all die.”

C: “…… You made my sister cry. Well then, you’ll have to take responsibility for that, won’t you?”

### Historical Image · Character Image (Written by Morise Ryou)

The twins (Dioscuri) who ascended to the heavens and became the radiant Gemini.
Their name, Dioscuri, means “children of Zeus”.

According to the 3rd century BC work Katasterismoi, the Gemini are called the Dioscures, composed of Castor and Pollux.
They later materialised in Lakonia (the southeast area of the Peloponnesian peninsula), and shortly thereafter ascended into the heavens.
Nothing could ever again surpass the love between those siblings.
The King of the Gods, Zeus, hoped that their relationship would be remembered into eternity, and so unified the stars of two separate constellations into one, which he named ‘the Twins’.

The archetype of the Dioscuri is that of the ancient twin gods, who took the form of youthful horsemen, or perhaps those of horses, and were said to be saviours to humans who were in peril from war or a sea voyage.
The twin gods were long referred to as simply “the two gods”, as they did not possess individual names, but in the time of the poet Homer, a collection of hymns were written, and their names were finally affirmed as Kastor (Castor) and Polydeuces (Pollux).

They both held the title Anakes, meaning lord, and through the stories passed down by later generations, such as the Argonautika, they became part of the crew aboard the Argo, and their aspect as the guardian deities of sailors became stronger.
It was later believed that the light that shines from the tip of a ship’s mast during a storm, known as “St. Elmo’s fire”, was the twins manifesting to guide the ship.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Gleaming twin gods who stand back to back.
At their core, they are ancient Divine Spirits who manifested with unique properties when they were summoned.
Although they are the same entity, they have two bodies, and each body holds their own differently-Classed nature.
In other words———

There is the elder brother, Castor, who received the legend of being a “child of man” without the blood of Zeus from later generations, and having turned the humiliation of falling from god to human into hatred, appears as an Avenger.
Then, there is the younger sister, Pollux, who received the legend of being “immortal” and carrying the blood of Zeus from later generations, and now continues to fight with her vicious swordsmanship and her body that knows no wound, appears as a Saber.

Their registered Spirit Origin is a Saber, but more accurately, they are a kind of Double-Class Servant.
Their special characteristics are likely exceptions due to them being Divine Spirit Servants.

The Dioscuri are always cuddled close together[1], and so are never separated. One could also phrase that as them ‘never being apart from one another’. They are two people as a single Heroic Spirit.
(Actually, as Servants they are basically never more than a few metres away from one another)

When the Fifth Lostbelt was first generated, they materialised as living gods.
The twin gods were defeated by Kirschtaria Wodime, and having lost their lives once already, formed a contract with him as Lostbelt Servants.
Through that contract, Castor learned of the legends of “their Proper Human History selves”, and despite those being Proper Human History’s affairs, began to harbour an immense loathing for humanity, which had so denigrated him.
Pollux too began to hold a deep grudge against humanity for looking down on her brother.
Consequently, both siblings were filled with the flames of a deep-seated hatred, and began to behave in a consistently cruel, violent manner towards both Chaldea and the citizens of Olympus.

In contrast, the twin gods summoned to Chaldea as Proper Human History Servants do not have the same fiercely violent nature as their Lostbelt Servant version.
While Castor has a nature and history sufficient to manifest with an Avenger Spirit Origin, his sister Pollux has a much gentler personality compared to her Lostbelt self. Because his sister is present to chide him, it is alright, to some extent, to let him loose.

The twin stars can’t help but laud that tiny traveller sailing through the Sea of Stars.
While blessings and praise flow from their mouths…
The truth is that their thoughts are filled with hopes and prayers.
