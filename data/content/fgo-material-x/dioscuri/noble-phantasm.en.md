Dioscures Tyndaridae.
The talent of Pollux, who is said to be a swordmaster, and the might of Castor, who resents his fall from his place among the gods. It is a perfect and complete combination attack, unleashed by the twins who continue to snuggle together in the heavens.
The coordination of their special move is born from their tremendous trust in one another, and now sublimates to the realm of a Noble Phantasm.

Furthermore, if only when they release its True Name, the two are able to almost completely recover the Divinity they held as ancient gods, and their Divine Cores will temporarily be of the greatest rank. As they attack after exercising near-absolute Divine Spirit-scale magical energy, they ignore all physical and magical obstacles and defences, and pulverise the target into nothing.

Alpha Castor, Beta Pollux.
Their armaments are Noble Phantasms in and of themselves, radiant starlight being turned into a shield and sword respectively.
The shield has a Conceptual Defence effect when its True Name is released, but that is fundamentally not used in “FGO”.
