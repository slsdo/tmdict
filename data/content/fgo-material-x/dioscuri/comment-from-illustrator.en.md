They’re a Servant composed of both a man and a woman, so I have a strong memory of how hard it was to draw two people in their Standing Art and in their Final Ascension. The motif was the legends of the Gemini from Greek mythology, so the image that came to mind for their clothes was a chiton (giving the impression of the cloth drooping down). The laurel-like ornament originated on Pollux’s design, but because of the image of her brandishing her sword as a vanguard, I intuitively wanted to make it look like the visor on the front of a cap or a helmet, so I added that.
