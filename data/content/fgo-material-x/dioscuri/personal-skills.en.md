### Star of the King of the Gods: A

A skill that symbolises the way of being of the twin gods, who have become a single entity as a constellation.
They possess the legend that they were ancient gods of the stars, who were turned into a constellation by Zeus. It demonstrates the way of being they both possess, not just that of one or the other.

### Guardians of Sea Voyages: B

They bring protection to those who travel by boat.
The existence of the twin gods fills the people in the area around them with hope, invigorating them to surpass any obstacle.
It is a skill that resembles the Voyager of the Storm skill, and is intrinsically a composite skill that contains Charisma and Tactics.

### Mana Burst (Light/Ancient): A

These twin gods are, themselves, the light of St. Elmoâ€™s Fire, which flickers on the sea.
It is similar only in appearance to the subspecies Mana Burst that some Saint-type Servants use.
They can release magical energy in the form of light to power themselves up.
