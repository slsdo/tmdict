### Magic Resistance: A

Cancel spells of A-Rank or below, no matter what greater magecraft it is.

### Item Construction: B

Able to create tools that harbor magical energy. That said…the most common ones are “activated by running magical energy through them/one-time uses”. The latter mostly resemble bombs.

### Territory Creation: EX

The one who stands within the white walls of Camelot—stronghold of the Human Order.
She gives form to one of the greatest defensive formations in a confrontation with a “Threat to Humanity”.

### Fairy Eyes: -

Not the kind of Mystic Eyes possessed by humans, but rather an innate ability of fairies to “alter the world”.
Fairy Eyes possessed by high-ranking fairies are described as eyes capable of seeing through every lie, and reflecting the truth. To fairies, good will and ill will are seen as one and the same, and as such this is a mostly meaningless supernatural power as far as they are concerned. On the other hand, it would not bode well for a human, perplexed by the distinction between good and evil, to possess these eyes.
