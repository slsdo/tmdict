Around Caliburn.
Artoria’s mindscape is unleashed upon the physical world by the Staff of Selection. It is the tolling of the bells from Paradise, and it both strengthens and protects all those who fight alongside her…even if she herself does not know how it got its name…
(Although not reflected in the actual game, it’s supposed to be that “only Artoria herself is not buffed”)

Round of Avalon.
Artoria’s Noble Phantasm after she becomes the Guardian of Britain.
She manifests the Camelot of Twilight and bestows the gift of a “Knight of the Round Table” to those who fight alongside her.
(In game, its effects are the same as Around Caliburn)

Artoria Caster fulfilled her duties in the Fairy Kingdom and vanished.
Afterwards, having consecrated her body to the Holy Sword and turned into the Holy Sword itself, she became a supporting device for the Human Order, which aids “those who oppose a threat that endangers the planet”.
Its name is Artoria Avalon.
Her appearance in the third Ascension is actually the proper figure of the girl originally summoned here. What we see in the first and second Ascensions is but an emulation of the way of being of a “departed someone”, which created her…not the memories as a Fairy of Paradise, but the memories of spring from when she traveled as the Child of Prophecy.
