Appearance-wise, I was instructed to draw him as a “cynical, loner, small-time punk”. With a wooden sword in his hand, he gave me the impression of an aggressive lone wolf. It didn’t help that his eyes looked intimidating, too… Contrary to my initial expectations, he turned out to be friend shaped! My friend!!!! Adding comedic facial expressions made him even more animated. I am particularly fond of his uneven bangs! (Ginka)
