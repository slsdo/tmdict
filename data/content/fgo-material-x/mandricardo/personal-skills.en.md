### Armor of the Nine Worthies: A

This skill is the sublimation of the anecdote of Mandricardo wearing Hektor’s armor. All the numerous anecdotes surrounding Hektor strengthen Mandricardo’s body, with the collective overwhelming legendary power of said anecdotes granting him Pseudo-Charisma.

### The End Strike: C

On the verge of death, this skill enables Mandricardo to unleash an all-out strike. It is close to but not the same as Battle Continuation in the sense that he is guaranteed to perish after landing a strike.

The higher the rank, the greater the damage. At rank C, one full-power strike can be unleashed at just the right measure.

### Brigliadoro’s Neigh: A

This skill is the sublimation of the episode of Mandricardo stealing and riding the famed horse Brigliadoro. It increases his mobility, attack power, and reputation at the cost of making him an easy target for enemies.
To add, this skill allows him to steal and ride demonic beasts ranked C or lower.
