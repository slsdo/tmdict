Serment de Durendal: This Noble Phantasm embodies Mandricardo’s oath to not don a sword until he acquires the sought-after Durendal and in turn grants any weapon he wields specs equivalent to the legendary sword’s power.
Though bearing similarities to Lancelot’s Noble Phantasm Knight of Owner, Serment de Durendal surpasses the former in that it possesses the same level of power as Durendal, and in essence treats any weapon used as if it were the original sword.
It is worth noting, however, that while it copies Durendal’s default power, the durability corresponds to the rank of the weapon he uses (mostly at rank E).

Rêve de Durendal: This anti-personnel Noble Phantasm can be activated through the sealing and destroying of Serment de Durendal.
The unrivaled sword he once possessed is his again for the taking. Armor of the Nine Worthies, which is a regular skill in this state, is sublimed into Hektor’s sacred artifact, showing unparalleled improvement of his defense stats.

In a regular Holy Grail War, this Noble Phantasm can only be activated if Mandricardo believes his current self to be capable of wielding the true Durendal. Information regarding this Noble Phantasm is sealed and inaccessible even for his Master.

In the fifth Lostbelt, because Hektor gave him Durindana (Durendal) and because he was driven by his objective to save the friends he met on his journey, Mandricardo managed to activate this Noble Phantasm. He accomplished the miracle of thwarting Artemis’ arrow. Following this feat, Mandricardo perished.
