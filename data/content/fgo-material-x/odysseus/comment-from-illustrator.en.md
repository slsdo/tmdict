He was a great hero who, during the span of 10 years, travelled more than an air distance of 300km (some theories say the total distance travelled was more than 3000km) to return to his hometown of Ithaca. A tactician and a great man alike. He would fundamentally be a good-looking guy, but he had so many funny episodes, like when he washed up on the beach stark naked, when he was turned into an old man, and when he was tied to the mast of the ship. Because of this, I was worried about how how to really flesh out his design. About the “chest hole” which became a popular topic…I thought it would be necessary to have something like an exhaust vent for the pheromones produced by his unmatched chad energy, so I made that opening. I was also happy to see the implementation of a simple costume with the helmet being made playable. Oh, and I also designed the transforming robot horse. I would have never imagined it would be launched from a catapult, though… (redjuice)
