### Personality

A man with an unwavering will, a hero of the Trojan War, and one of the greatest adventurers in Greek mythology. He went on numerous adventures and overcame countless adversaries, and there is no question of why his name became the basis for the word “odyssey.”

Even were he boasting, he could back up his claims.
If he says he’ll take down Troy, that is what he’ll do.
If he says he’ll flee from a scene of carnage, that is what he’ll do.
If he says he’ll defeat monsters and Demonic Beasts, that is what he’ll do.
And if he says he’ll head home to reach his beloved Penelope, that is what he’ll do…one day.

At first glance he might appear overly confidant, but in reality he has a perfect grasp on his own abilities and capabilities.
He never acts with arrogance, always directly accepting the truth that he “just narrowly seized victory and glory” or “if the slightest thing changed, he would have met with death”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He views the Master as someone on their own journey; an adventure of constant hardships.
In a way, he sees in them the part of himself that once wandered the world in the hopes of reuniting with their loved one.

### Dialogue Examples

“There is nothing I cannot accomplish. Might as well give it a try.”
“In your great adventure of saving Pan-Human History, let me be of some assistance.”
“How heavy and painful even a single step forwards can be…I know a bit about that.” “I’ll overcome every single one of these challenges. Indeed, I shall remain by your side.”
“Aegis!”

### Historical Image · Character Image (Written by Morise Ryou)

A hero of ancient Greek mythology.
The protagonist of Homer’s famed epic “The Odyssey.”
His role in the Trojan War is recorded in “The Iliad.”

Odysseus was the Achaeans’ greatest strategist during the Trojan War. Following the death of Achilles, it was Odysseus who came up with the idea for the Trojan Horse, which directly led to the fall of Troy.
After the war, he sailed for home to return to his beloved Penelope. His journey was complicated by many obstacles, among which were: a vicious cyclops, Poseidon’s curse, temptation at the hands of Circe the witch and Calypso the nymph, the enchanting song of the sirens, the dread monster Scylla, the wrath of the sun god Helios, and myriad other hardships. Eventually, though not without sacrifice, Odysseus overcame these many trials and made it home.

◇

In Atlantis of the Fifth Lostbelt, he manifested as a Servant from Pan-Human History, going up against the Lostbelt Odysseus who sided with the gods. Both were neck and neck, but for a brief moment it looked like the Odysseus of Pan-Human History had the upper hand. However, the Klironomia granted by Zeus were activated, ultimately granting the Lostbelt Odysseus victory.

While the memories of the battle in the Lostbelt should not have been retained by the Odysseus summoned to Chaldea, he actively searched through Chaldea’s records, and so there’s reason to believe that he knows what happened. Despite having a different upbringing and end than his own, the great debt his Lostbelt self owed to Charlotte Corday is something that he will never forget, and he vows to repay her one day.
