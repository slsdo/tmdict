Troia Híppos.
Near the end of the Trojan War, Odysseus arranged for a large wooden horse that would be brought within the impregnable walls of Troy, hiding numerous Greek soldiers (Achaeans) within this “offering.” Ultimately, the Trojans brought their enemies inside, and were defeated by getting in the resulting ambush, leading to the Achaean army’s victory. According to literature, it was said that Odysseus was among those inside the wooden horse, and that he fought alongside these warriors.

The Noble Phantasm’s wooden horse is in fact a giant mount covered in divine steel armor that suggests it has the blessings of the Aegis thanks to Athena. After its True Name is revealed, the wooden horse becomes a titanic being that annihilates everything around it in a demonstration of the fierceness of the Trojan War.

Aegis.
A defensive armament created by the gods of Olympus. It is said to be armor or shield, and an extraordinary powerful bounded field, a conceptual defense mechanism of divine creation. However, Odysseus is able to don it as a physical armor, likely thanks to Athena’s deep affection for him, granting him an invincible suit of armor made of divine steel, possessing conceptual defenses.

A Noble Phantasm that is continuously active.
It is expressed as a skill in FGO.

Penelope.
A Noble Phantasm named after his beloved wife.
Odysseus, in proving his complete love for Penelope, made a show of effortlessly stringing his bow, which no one else was able to. In other words, Odysseus is someone adept at handling stringless bows.
As a Noble Phantasm, it manifests as Odysseus shooting an “arrow of light” using neither string nor even a bow, in an act reminiscent of the gods of Olympus.
It is a continuously active Noble Phantasm, and in FGO, releasing its True Name has no additional effect.
