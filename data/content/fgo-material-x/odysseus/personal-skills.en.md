### Insight of the Cunning General: B++

A skill representing the knowledge Odysseus displayed, not only during the Trojan war, but throughout all his adventures.
Those acting with Odysseus on their side will surely be victorious.

### Single-Mindedness (Love): A

A most focused state of mind…the source of his unwavering will.
His devotion to his loving wife Penelope will never sway. Calypso the nymph, the witch Circe of Aeaea, the ephemeral Queen Nausicaa…all these women fell for Odysseus. Even the blessings he received from Athena were likely an indication that she too had fallen for him.
While Odysseus seemed to be a lady-killer, he himself was fully devoted to his love.
It’s just that during his long voyage back home to his Penelope, for some reason he kept encountering women.
(At least that’s how he sees it.)

### Divine Body Bounded Field: A

The crystallized armor of the gods, combining defense and offense in one.
It is a skill-version of the Noble Phantasm of the same name.

### Grace of the Gods: B+

A skill that represents the grace received from the gods of Olympus.
It can create numerous different effects.
Because Athena’s love was especially intense, Odysseus was given a special allowance to use the Noble Phantasm Aegis, the gods’ own defense.
(Fundamentally not utilized as a skill in FGO.)
