### Magic Resistance: C

Negates spells with a chant of two verses or less.
Cannot defend against something more complex, like high magecraft or ritual curses.

### Independent Action: A+

The ability to sustain herself for a while even if the mana supply from the Master is severed.
For the sake of her mission, she can fight alone.

### Mad Enhancement: EX

Ranks up all parameters but deprives her of most of her sanity.

It’s unknown if this property was carried over from her original Berserker Saint Graph or if it was kept as a unique trait of the Heroic Spirit Nightingale.
She speaks slightly more tenderly than when she was a Berserker, but her basic conversation style hasn’t changed all that much.
