### Personality

The Angel of Crimea, who takes duty and devotion as her creed.
A conviction of steel. One who saves people. The Little War Office.
Her character is almost the same when she’s a Berserker, but…

Wonky logic and treatment regardless of consent.
That part is still is the exact same as the regular Nightingale. However…
Upon closer inspection, her words are slightly more graceful than usual.
While not frequently, you may even see her talking like a dreamer.
Archer Nightingale has her mentality mixed with the mentality of the younger Nightingale, the one from before she experienced nursing and medical care firsthand. For that reason, she’s minutely more inclined to use phrasings and expressions that evidence her wealthy background.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She wishes all the candy in the world would turn into medicine (like sweet cold remedies).
Also that Christmas should be changed into a holiday that celebrates the healing of wounds and ailments.
But she would never a cast a wish upon the Holy Grail for it.
Archer Nightingale wants to do it herself.
If you ask her “Isn’t it supposed to be ‘I wish all medicine in the world would turn to candy’?”, her answer would be “What’s the point? Of turning medicine? Into candy?”.
She’s not any willing to back down about this particular detail.
“Candy turning into medicine is a thing that dreams are made of. But medicine must remain as medicine”.

### Dialogue Examples

“Nice to meet you. How do you do? Any issues with your health?”
“No, I am not an angel. Please refrain from repeating the same misinformation.”
“Excuse me, it’s time for your treatment.”
“Never forget to wash your hands and rinse your mouth. Are we understood?”
“Disinfection, sterilization, pasteurization!”

Omitted for length. See Miyamoto Musashi’s page for more details.

### Character Image

Almost the same as Nightingale(Berserker).
She carries a large firearm that looks like a rifle but also like an umbrella, and her class was changed to Archer.
Judging by the key red tone in her outfit, she’s a Santa Servant, apparently…(?)

<>

The reason for this Saint Graph alteration was Nursery Rhyme’s meddling.
After a series of incidents, Archer Nightingale accepted the child she once was and will then do her job as a new Santa Servant.
More specifically…

All while praying in the Holy Night, she will…
Fight to improve nursing and hygiene, and defeat all illnesses.

It’s the same as always…?
That may be right, but it also may not be.

### Connections with Characters

#### All Servants

Nightingale perceives all Servants as “soldiers”.
They get injured often.
In other words, they are nursing patients.

#### Enemies

Whoever attacks her is an enemy soldier, but they are also lives to be saved.
She must first incapacitate them or else she won’t be able to treat them or nurse them.

#### Caligula / Phantom / Gilles (Caster) / Salome / Salieri / Mori Nagayoshi / Baobhan Sith

The mentally ill are nursing patients too.

#### Monte Cristo

He’ll need some nursing in the special ward.
Ah, he’s escaping again! Mister!
Hold it right there. Mister!

#### Ashiya Douman

Stop.
It seems you need nursing in the special ward.
Hurry!
