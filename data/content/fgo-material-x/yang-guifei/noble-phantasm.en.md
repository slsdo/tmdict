Geishō’ui Hiyokurenri.
One of the verses from the Chinese poem “Song of Everlasting Regret”, composed by Bai Juyi, that regales the undying love between Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei.
They say Xuanzong had the “Raiments of Feathers and Rainbow” be composed for Yang Guifei, but it was shunned as a forbidden piece for making her out to be a beauty that would lead to the country’s demise and even its draft was lost after a while.
Before her marriage, Yang Guifei was ordained as a nun for a time, receiving a high rank, and was initiated into the arts by the Taoist, Luo Gongyuan{{n1}} from whom she received the title “Taoist Taizhen”. It is said that her soul became an immortal of Mount Penglai and there she waits for the reunion with her beloved emperor.
The star of the abyss secretly recites a song that can not reach the ears of mortals.
