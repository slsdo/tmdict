### Existence Outside the Domain: EX

The Descender from Outer Space, from the Void.
One that was enthralled by an Evil God, dancing and strumming while adorning their body with a scale of that authority.

### Divinity: B

Having become the precursor of a higher-order existence lurking within Outer Space, she was adorned with strong Divinity.
Though it’s as if it had no effect at all on Yang Guifei, who reigns as a symbol of beauty in Human History…
Perhaps her compatibility with the Evil God was way too good.
