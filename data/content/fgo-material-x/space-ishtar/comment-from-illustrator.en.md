According to Space Ishtar’s initial setting, there was only one character, and the trend was that said one character would transform through ascension. However, in the settings of the character that I received, there were 3 characters: a good, an evil, and a space-like one. Since they each had parents and their own personal histories, I ended up imagining the lives and lifestyles that each of them have built up so I did not want to omit any of them which I told Nasu-san as well. That there are 3 characters, aren’t there. And that’s how we ended up with around 3 characters. In terms of the direction for the design, for her first ascension, I expanded the image from her countenance when she was a mimic in “hollow”. The second one is in the style of a free-spirited bounty-hunter cowgirl pairing up with her partner Jane, and the third was designed with a not-so MADE IN JIGOKU feel. Since the three are identical yet different characters, I paid attention to making them appear as their own existences even if they were to be lined up next to each other so it wouldn’t feel like the character was simply changing her outfit. The ribbon is the same as the one worn in “EXTRA”. I asked Hirai Yukio-san to design the Maanna spaceship that flies through the galaxy. I’m so grateful to him… At first, we were going to go with a gigantic spaceship like in Independence Day for the Goddess Temple, but god-knows-how, it ended up with the form of a giant goddess.
