Edin Shugurra Quasar.
An Anti-Alien Invasion Noble Phantasm that calls forth the Temple Bel Maanna - which could be called the “Symbol of the Goddess” in the Primordial Universe - before unleashing the “High Dimensional Soul”─────the Saint Graph Galaxy making up the Temple and burning up a whole sector (of space) after converting it into energy.

In the Sumerian and Akkadian languages, ‘Edin’ means steppe or field. This is said to be the origin of the word ‘Eden’ that appears in the Old Testament.
‘Shugurra’ is the crown that was in that Edin. It is what was given to Ishtar when she entered Edin.
‘Quasar’ is a modern-age astronomy term. It means ‘quasi-stellar’.
They are called the “brightest celestial bodies” due to emitting powerful light and are found in sectors that are very far away from the Earth.

It is a Noble Phantasm that damages every enemy, but it also has the added effect of increasing the damage dealt by the Extra card during the turn it was used.
“If you’re gonna use S Ishtar’s Noble Phantasm then go as far as the Extra attack”, is what it’s saying.
