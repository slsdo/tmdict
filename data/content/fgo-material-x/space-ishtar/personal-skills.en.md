### Devil’s Sugar A

Even while being bothered by having been reduced to a mere demon, she makes thorough use of her powers of “seduction and arousal”, just like a true demon would.
S Ishtar’s smiles and blown kisses raise the morale of her allies, allowing them to ignore the burden on their bodies and draw out power beyond their limits. Since what’s being used on her allies is pretty much a charm (curse), they won’t be affected by the enemy’s charms since they are already head over heels for S Ishtar.
You might as well call this the Charisma of a Demon that combined her facet as a goddess of victory and her facet as a demon.
 
### Venus Driver: B

The operator of Venus. The driver of beauty.
The divine protection of Venus increases the power of her Noble Phantasm in addition to changing its attribute at will. A skill fitting for the “Goddess of Origin” who had numerous goddesses derived from her in the end.
 
### Multiple Starling: EX

A single great crown.
What returned to its original form by stacking up the crowns of the many goddesses fit to be “queens of the heaven” that were derived from the goddess that served as Ishtar’s origin.
It grants a great amount of NP and can increase the performance of every card with a high probability.
