### Personality

(※There are subtle differences in her personality and standpoint between ascensions 1, 2, and 3, but, fundamentally, her personality is as listed below)
She is an outlaw while also a heroine of justice.
She has an odd standpoint where she makes villain-like moves, but everything she does is for the sake of others.
She perceives herself as a “threat to humanity” and her alignment has become “evil” as well, but that does not mean she is a bad guy or a villain.
Her personality is almost the same as Ishtar’s, but she will never toy with others to entertain herself.
She acknowledges the good deeds of others with pride, deeming them “righteous actions” and feeling all happy about them in secret, while she scowls with hostility at the evil deeds of others, deeming them “something horrible” as she hurls abuses at them with great gusto.
(And in case the other party is a villain, she’ll wring out their assets, life, and destiny)

Like Ishtar, S Ishtar has a free and uninhibited personality and is concerned about the cruelty and shallowness of human society; apart from that, she takes people’s livelihood into consideration to some extent, cares about good humans in her own way, and ultimately puts the victory of everyone above her own rewards… And so, she acts in a way that isn’t reminiscent of Ishtar.

For example, even if she were to - like Ishtar did during the Summer Race - attempt to resurrect Gugalanna at the expense of her surroundings to regain her authority, in S Ishtar’s case she would surely reflect on herself, destroy Gugalanna with her own hands and share the resources with the race’s participants in the end.
“Well, this is such a waste that I’d love to go on a rampage in frustration, but I felt like this was what had to be done! See, you just can’t lie to yourself, right?”
In this manner, while she is basically Ishtar herself, she would never become humanity’s enemy in the final stage……in other words, S Ishtar is a goddess who is “bad in terms of being Ishtar”.

### Attitude towards Master

She is extremely interested in the thing known as the “Master” who contracts and uses Servants despite being just a human.
“Eh? There is such a job like that in your world? Isn’t that amazing even though you’re a human!?”
Having recognized humans as “weak beings”, she is honestly impressed that one is able to comprehend and communicate with Servants.
While she does not respect the Master, she perceives them as “someone important”,
“I’ll listen to what you say as long as I feel like it♡” she says with the smile of a little devil.

Since she is from a different universe and a different world, she does her best not to empathize with the Master more than necessary, but since the guard of her heart (love flags) is weak, she is guaranteed to stray from the path at a moment’s notice.
Since regular Ishtar’s sense of distance is close, she possesses the “appeal of a neighborhood older sister”, but due to SW2 Ishtar’s unduly distant manner, the appeal of a neighborhood older sister is diminished. In exchange, her impression as a heroine who “despite being somewhat out of your league, is shining right beside you” is strong.
tively calm.

### Dialogue Examples

First Ascension: Supreme Ruler of Evil Ishtar Composed, somewhat aggressive polite language. A young lady of great upbringing. Fundamentally earnest and polite.
However, she is always in a bad mood (angry). When she reveals her true colors, she becomes the usual Rin. She’s got a sharp tongue when expressing her anger.

Second Ascension: Cowgirl Ishtar
Unreserved and confident, her tone combines the boldness of the wilds with the lightness of a young girl. What she does might be dangerous, but it is based on justice.
She keeps others more at a distance than regular Ishtar (since ultimately, she does not want to depend on others). She is a heroine of justice, she isn’t satisfied until she returns the humiliation and loans she received many times over.

Third Ascension: Goddess of Origin Ishtar
The personality of a transcendental being. Her lines are more machine-like and lacking in emotion. She is the cool and mysterious-chan kind.
While it might be difficult to put emotions into her lines, she is “the protector of humanity, the goddess born for humanity’s sake” resulting from the union/fusion of the first and second ascensions.
She is of the “kind on the inside even if her tone is cold” faction. However, she has a very sharp tongue when she goes on angry rants. Her designation as a “Threat to Humanity” is gone due to having changed to the side that protects humanity.

### Setting

Space Ishtar is “the goddess that exists in reality” in the Servant Universe.

She is not “the goddess of the Venus seen (observed) by Earthlings who presides over said planet”, but “the goddess of Venus who arose in the ancient civilization on Venus,” so from an Earthling’s perspective, it could be said that she is an alien herself.

Her outward appearance matches that of Fate/EXTRA’s Tohsaka Rin.
The Primordial Universe refers to the “universe in which humans were humans” that existed way before the Sapphire Galaxy (The ether universe. The world of the current Universe.); even further back in that ancient universe─────before the birth of mammals on Earth, the goddess worshipped by the prehistoric ancient civilization of that universe was Astarte.
During those times, the concept of faith did not exist; the word goddess referred to “the sector of space where life can exist”.
It is not clear whether that concept took shape or whether that way of being was used as a concept, but Ishtar-Astarte of the Primordial Universe became “a galaxy taking on the shape of a human”.
Originally, she is not something that mortals could handle or something that could become a Servant.
(At the climax of SW2, no attack would work on the “Astarte from the times of the Primordial Universe” that appeared as a boss, but that was due to this “galaxy lifeform argument”. Since she is actually a galaxy, the attacks of humans are way too tiny so they can only pass through her.)

Since the universe has transformed from the Primordial Universe into the Sapphire Galaxy, the ancient civilization moved on from this dimension and Astarte was supposed to also become a simple galaxy and fall into a slumber.
However, the greedy (desiring to see more of the universe’s future and human civilization) Astarte refused to obey the rules of the Sapphire Galaxy and remained as an evil goddess.

Spreading as the Primordial Universe, Astarte became the “Crimson Taboo Space Sector” and continued to remain within the Sapphire Galaxy.
The time her Divine Core took shape and she clearly began to erode the Sapphire Universe was 2000 years ago.
To avoid this, the Goddess Subjugation A Team (including Jane and Sigurd) was put together and they destroyed the core of the goddess that served as the center of the Taboo Space Sector. Astarte once again fell into a slumber.

And then, a few hundred years later.
Within the ruins of the altar of the Primordial Universe, Professor Tokiomi found Astarte who “reincarnated as human” sleeping inside a crystal cradle.

In secret, Professor Tokiomi took custody of this crystal cradle and took it home.
After that, unconsciously, the goddess divided herself into an “evil half” and a “good half”. This gave humanity a choice: Which one would they pick? Which one could they coexist with?
After thinking it over carefully, Tokiomi decided to raise the “evil half” as a “good goddess”.

Thus, knowing nothing, S Ishtar developed at a rapid rate.
However, on S Ishtar’s 14th birthday, Professor Tokiomi was killed by Space Shinkage-ryuu, an evil organization that got wind of the existence of the Goddess of Origin, Astarte, and the “other half” that was hidden in the house was also stolen.
(S Ishtar wasn’t told about this other half)

Left on her own, Tokiomi’s daughter, S Ishtar became a bounty hunter and chased after Space Shinkage-ryuu to avenge her father.
The other half that Space Shinkage-ryuu took with them was raised as the “Daughter of the Supreme Ruler of Evil, Astarte” so Space Shinkage-ryuu could use her as a tool for ruling the universe.

The two Ishtars don’t know.
About the existence of the other. And just which is “good” and which is “evil”.

Ascension 1: Ishtar as the Supreme Ruler of Evil
The genius swordswoman raised by the evil organization, Space Shinkage-ryuu, who eventually reached the rank of supreme ruler.
Cold and gloomy, but has excellent manners.
In truth, she is the “good half”.
To her, Space Shinkage-ryuu is like a family and she works hard every day for the sake of achieving their dearest wish.

Ascension 2: Ishtar as a bounty hunter cowgirl
The gunman of justice raised by the strict but kind Professor Tokiomi.
A free and uninhibited young girl who goes at full power when it comes to living life.
Due to the shock of having her father killed, her body stopped developing when she was 14. (The same goes for Astarte)
In truth, she is the “evil half”.
To take revenge on the Space Shinkage-ryuu that killed her father, her class changed from Archer to Avenger…or so she believes, but her class was Avenger from the start.

Ascension 3: Ishtar of the Primordial Universe
Her appearance as a goddess that awakened to an even greater extent.
Ishtar doing a classic final boss-like move that was unlikely to happen.
In this form, she can bring out the Bel Maanna.

■Ancient Temple Bel Maanna
S Ishtar is not “always on her boat” like Ishtar.
What S Ishtar calls forth is a temple (the temple of Baal, which is said to have been built by Anat), its appearance ominous and form aggressive…that is what’s been told, but…

■Goddess Temple Bel Maanna
At the end of SW2, Ishtar and the protagonist arrived at primordial coordinate X, an area of the Sapphire (Ether) Cosmos - the cosmos of the Servant Universe - where entry is forbidden.
There, the supreme ruler of evil, Ishtar-Astarte, and Space Munenori were lying in wait for them.
Something like a temple is floating at coordinate X; this is Bel Maanna, which is said to be “the temple that was once used by the Goddess of Origin”.
With the disappearance of the goddess, Bel Maanna collapsed, but with the goddess’ revival, it reactivated itself.
In the story, it was oftentimes described as an “ancient shrine” so everyone was picturing it as a temple, but the Bel Maanna that has been restored to its full glory turned out to be a spaceship in the form of a super-giant-sized Ishtar.
Bel Maanna is Ishtar-Astarte’s blade and also a part of herself; only by using this “Goddess Temple” can she be the true “Goddess of Origin”.

■Astarte Origin
The last boss that revived along with Bel Maanna.
The gaseous nebula concealing coordinate X is “the particles of Astarte that scattered after her defeat”.
After Astarte’s successful revival ceremony, the galaxy of coordinate x converged in a single spot, gathering together into the shape of a woman and becoming Astarte Origin.
Since Astarte is “a galaxy that took the form of a goddess”, attacks below galaxy size are invalidated.

### Connections with Characters

#### Calamity Jane

Her partner who stayed with her through thick and thin.
Her family that she can rely on the most in the universe, but also the troublemaker she can trust the least in the universe.

#### Heroine X

A reliable comrade she got to know as a bounty hunter.
She doesn’t know anything about her other than that.

#### Heroine XX

The demon-like OL that taught S Ishtar a lesson on several occasions, after she got carried away from her goddess powers in the “Galactic 3 Goddess Alliance” volume.
She doesn’t know anything about her other than that.

#### Yagyuu Tajima no Kami

A person that Astarte remembers even now and won’t forget until the end.
Her mentor of the heart, her beloved and respected─────

#### ■■■■■■■■

The legendary Servant who is said to have destroyed the ancient Venusian civilization, a mysterious civilization that flourished on Venus after the “Sapphire Galaxy” came to be, in a single night.
“I didn’t mean to do that. I just extended my solo karaoke session by 3 hours.” is how the person in question insisted.
They might fight one day. Or maybe not since the genres (space opera and tokusatsu) are different.

#### ■■■■■

The Wandering Star advancing through space has existed since the “Primordial Universe” and their existence has been confirmed even after it became the “Sapphire Galaxy”.
The Wandering Star passes through various galaxies, capturing and preserving superior species to use them as their next purging weapon; it is said Astarte Origin’s sphere of intelligent life has also suffered harm from this.
