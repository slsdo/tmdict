### Magic Resistance: C

Invalidates magic below C rank.
Her high magic resistance as an Archer-class cannot be displayed in the Servant Universe.
 
### Independent Action: C

S Ishtar, who was born as a goddess, raised as a mortal and awakened as a Servant, does not consume mana to remain materialized even without being contracted to a Master.
 
### Divine Core of the Goddess: A++

A skill symbolizing that one has been a perfect goddess from her birth. It possesses the effect of preserving the absoluteness of the mind and the body.
It repels just about every kind of mental interference while preventing the body from growing and the figure from changing no matter how many calories are intaken.
It is also a composite skill that comprises the Divinity skill.
Having inherited the Divine Core of the “Ancient Goddess of Fertility and War”…who served as a prototype for the many goddesses that possessed the likeness of Ishtar…Ishtar, Astarte, Anat, it has become nearly top-rank.
 
### Avenger: EX

The state of an avenger as one that gathers people’s hatreds and grudges onto oneself having turned into a skill.
Something that mixes together the anger and pain she felt from how the Great Goddess had become regarded as a lowly devil for some reason, and the sorrow felt that “…thinking back on it, I really have no excuse for ending up like that, do I…”.
This goddess who regards herself as evil while standing on the side of justice (order) feels somewhat unfit to be an avenger.
※In the Old Testament, this goddess is named “Ashtoret”, which was used to refer to fertility goddesses or foreign goddesses, but this name born from the Old Testament would rather be degraded into that of a demon (Astaroth) in Western Europe.
 
### Oblivion Correction: A

People are creatures that forget many things, but avengers never forget.
Love and hate from the distant past that humans cannot perceive. Her act of venting her anger on the humans who have forgotten her past majesty and authority, or rather, her iron hammer against injustice, becomes incredibly powerful.
 
### Self-Replenishment (Mana): B

S Ishtar’s Magical Energy endlessly surges until her revenge is accomplished, until she feels refreshed.
The nature of the “Goddess of Origin” who got excited all on her own when left alone and arbitrarily started a final war had become a skill without any changes.
