### Personality

A person who lifts the moods of others, wanting to support “someone who does their best” rather than “herself”. As far as Jane is concerned, with her extremely positive thoughts, the future is something that will come as a matter of course. She will never lose hope, even if the existence of the universe before her is at stake, and she will believe in everyone surviving in the end with an easygoing attitude. Her motives are all out of a good will, but there are times when she will occasionally take actions that will leave others with some doubts and make them question “Is she actually a good person?” For example, if a hypothetical situation becomes something like, “Watch out! It looks like the bridge is gonna collapse!”, then she will come to a house in the neighbourhood and completely cut off and take a supporting pillar from it for the bridge.

The only disciple taken in by Professor Tokiomi – a space archaeologist who held a principle where he did not take in any disciple with the exception of his daughter (Ishtar) – and, should he be in an emergency and something happened to him as a result, someone who earned his trust to the extent that he would entrust Jane with the situation that would occur after his death. Nonetheless, she had not been academically appreciated by the Professor, viewing her as someone like an unworthy disciple who was not able to learn the orthodox techniques to accurately decipher the historical materials and infer the historical facts from them; instead of trying to use those orthodox techniques, she would start to say “It was right where I was pointing at with my sixth sense” when discovering a relevant material.

To Professor Tokiomi, he had predicted that “Even if I can teach her the innate goodness of man by following a textbook, to me, (because Ishtar is a clever child,) she will see through that fake goodness right away, and aside from the period of time where I am staying close to her, she may eventually lose interest in that goodness and completely shift to her natural wickedness. But if she – by looking at Jane, who is a good person from the very beginning and is not two-faced, and who arrives at the truth in a straight line after some struggle… despite the fact that there are even some times where she brings about destruction and disorder to the surroundings as compensation for those traits – can come to realize that good and evil are not necessarily limited to the two sides of the same coin, I think she will at least never end up stooping to plain evil.”

And just as the Professor predicted there, Ishtarin carried through with her training as the brilliant straight woman of the duo to Jane’s comedy act without lapsing into wickedness even once, and although she is fussy during the times when she is calculating her profits, and although it is somewhat easy for her to lose her temper, she had healthily(?) grown up into a fierce bounty hunter who helps the weak and snaps at the strong.
Moreover, regarding Jane, she has truly not changed at all, astonishingly.

Jane will never blame other people, and on the contrary, she will rejoice and praise them for anything they accomplish, no matter how trivial those accomplishments are. In addition, regarding that kind of point, she has a good compatibility with Ishtar, who gets carried awa… er, rather, who grows with praise.

A capable space scout, Jane’s survival abilities are exceptional. However, she has zero life skills. Her sabotage and disturbance skills that do not involve anti-personnel targets (and when she is put on the spot) are reliable, but her direct anti-personnel combat capabilities fall one step short in comparison.

### Dialogue Examples

“It’s okay! You can do it. Yeah, you can do it! Although I’m not confident you actually can!”
“Eh? You dropped your cell phone in that crevice over there? Leave it to meee☆
I’ll try setting some explosives in there right away!”
“Ishtariiin~
You know, the output is somewhat insufficient, so I’m going to use your gems, alriiight?” (“But Ishtar is sleeping!”)

### Historical Image · Character Image

A scout and gunslinger from America’s Frontier Era. Although Jane is not a so-called ‘outlaw’, and although much of her achievements are exaggerated and she has made many dubious claims, she had lived a life that was filled with both praise and censure, even during the days when she was alive. She has a large quantity of debuffing Skills mixed in with her positive disposition due to that dual nature of hers. A figure of the American West who took the word “Calamity” for her own name, and someone who lived in the same time period as Billy the Kid. An expert with guns, and a brilliant scout, she was crowned with the nickname “The Heroine of the Plains” for being the comrade-in-arms of her lover “Wild Bill” Hickok – “The Champion of the Plains”, the two having simultaneously ran through many predicaments together.

Regarding how Jane got the name “Calamity”, there is a rumour where she is “The Helping Hand who Saves Those From Calamity” in that she rescued the cavalry that were being assailed by the Indigenous Peoples, there is a rumour where she is “The Woman who Invokes Calamity” in that her lovers would always lose their lives in the middle of battle, and there is another rumour where both of these folk tales are regarded as true. She is also known as “Miss Greedy Woman”.

### Character Image

A bounty hunter who does not think about difficult matters, is cheerful and happy, and loves new things. Jane’s life’s work is to support those who she cares about rather than herself. A Space☆Cheerleader who lives on “this day”, forgetting about the grudges from yesterday as well as the debts from the days before yesterday once and for all.

In the Servant Universe, Jane joined the “Primeval Goddess Sealing Team” 2000 years ago as their scout. Although the team succeeded in the sealing operation due to the accurate reconnaissance data that Jane provided, Jane received a curse of “immortality” as the price for killing the Goddess, and that resulted in her completely attaining a body that is unable to die until the time the Goddess awakens again. By all rights, a person’s spirit would get tired and degenerate from wandering for a long time, but Jane did not fall to her knees from this curse because of her characteristic cheerfulness.

### Connections with Characters

#### Space Ishtar (First Saint Graph{{n1}})

“As far as I’m concerned, Ishtarin is my friend, my money, my partner, and my target, but after all is said and done, she’s very much my friend, you know?☆
But say, I do have a problem with her in not giving even the slightest attention to my romantic tales~
Master from Earth, I wonder, but won’t you come back for me once again?~”

#### Billy the Kid

“What do you think about a fella who happened to get shot from behind and die while in the middle of playing poker? Stupid? Aahhaahaaa! I think so too!!”

#### Paul Bunyan

“No way, that’s Paul Bunyan!? She’s a very cute girl, right————!? Nice, this Bunyan is niiice! I want to take her with me on a trip to the Frontier!!”

#### Sigurd

“Wow, this Sigurd has a wife! Something like a pairing between a beautiful man and a beautiful woman; I diiig it~!
… Huh? Buuut you can say with confidence that your wife has a maxed out murderous impulse? Oh Sigurd, did you have an affair or something!?”

#### Stheno

“Remind me, did I ever tell you who was in the Goddess Suppression A-Team~?
Although I can’t say the name of the Master who took the trouble to bring all of us together, it was Sigurd of the Spedra Busters, Old Man Hec from the Trojan Colony, me, an Ancient Goddess – Lady Stheno, who took sides with humanity… or perhaps I should say, collected funds from her believers for our activities, the broken Rider – Red Rabbit, and that cosmic good-for-nothing bum Merlin. Also, Space Toshizou, who took me all the way to the Taboo Region by ship. These 8 + one more person altogether defeated the gargantuan Ishtarin☆”
