### Subversive Activities: B

A Skill for a brilliant scout. The ability to reduce the effectiveness of the enemies’ attacks by perceiving the slightest gap in those attacks in order for Jane to position herself in those attacks’ blind spots. It is the same as Robin Hood’s Subversive Activities.

### Galactic Messenger: EX

A Skill that is based on the historical fact where Jane swam across a chilly river in order to have directives delivered. It lowers enemies’ morales while raising allies’ morales. But because “it is not clear whether that historical fact is true or not”, the attack power up being applied to her allies becomes probability-based. (Given that Jane herself believes in that historical fact, she will definitely power up.)

### O’ Polar Star, Show Me the Way: B

A miniaturized version of Jane’s “Sentinel Stellaris” Noble Phantasm that can now be no longer used anymore. A unique Skill whose effect increases in efficacy in proportion to the amount of critical stars available to her. It is said that it was originally a Noble Phantasm for the purpose of finding out that one hope that can turn the tables, meant to be used against “a threat from a different dimension that is impossible for humanity to defeat.”
