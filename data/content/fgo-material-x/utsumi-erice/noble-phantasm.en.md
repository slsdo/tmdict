An ominous ritual that reenacts the reversal of the “Kuniumi (birth of the country Japan)” that was done by the Great Deities/Izanagi and Izanami. Erice’s personal Magecraft that she inherited from a power of the Underworld Goddess, and something she acquired by undergoing the Quasi-Servantification process. With a replica of a Deity-Made Ritual Equipment – the “Heavenly Marsh Spear (Ame-no-Nuboko)” – Erice stirs spacetime within a targeted space, before the spear estimates and calculates the targeted space’s framework; it then sends all of that framework that was contained within that targeted space, as well as all of its mass, meaning and fate, back to the Primordial Chaos. In the case of a Servant(s) becoming the target(s), it cuts off their Saint Graph framework from them and cancels it. A Noble Phantasm that returns everything to Yomi (The Land of the Dead) with a reversal of entropy.
