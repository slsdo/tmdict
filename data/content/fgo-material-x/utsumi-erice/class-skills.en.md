### Riding: C+

The ability for riding.

In addition to small-sized vessels from both ancient and modern times, Erice can manage modernistic means of transportation such as automobiles, bikes and light aircrafts with above-average skill.

### Magical Resistance (Spirit): B+

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of three verses or below. It is difficult to damage Erice who has this rank of Magical Resistance with Magecraft, even if she was targeted by Great Magecrafts, Ritual Spells and the like.

Erice particularly possesses a strong resistance to encroaching-type Spiritual Bodies.

### Independent Action: B

A special characteristic of a Quasi-Servant. Magical Energy is necessary in the case of taking action in combat, but if it happens to be taking action in things other than that, it is possible for Erice to act just like any other normal human being without consuming Magical Energy.

### Divinity: E

Erice is barely being endowed with a Divinity that originates from the Underworld Goddess/Izanami. This Divinity also has an effect on her Riding Skill.
