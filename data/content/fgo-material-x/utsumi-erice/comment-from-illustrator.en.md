Ms. Erice was happy that the ideas came to me relatively smoothly. There was also a discussion where she was initially going to have a design with a black colour theme, but given that I wanted to let people have the image of primitive Japanese clothes when looking at her, I tried to make a white colour base for her design theme. It was fun to draw a large number of different facial expressions on her too. Her miffed face and cat face are my favourite. (NOCO)
