### Personality

Erice regards efficiency as important. She prefers functional and practical tools and garments, as well as simple and sturdy objects. Regarding food, she likes the ones that are spicy and/or have high nutritional value. She likes the stimuli that comes from eating those foods, and while she is indifferent to the subtle differences of flavours, she sometimes shows a weird pickiness about the food she wants to eat too. She feels antipathy towards Mages, and Erice herself has a belief that she is rather a “Spellcaster”, but now…

Erice is considerably well-acquainted with Heroic Spirits of all times and places. During her spare time, she would devotedly look over books and video materials related to Heroic Spirits. She makes the best use of that information to relentlessly deal with Servants as the “Grim Reaper”, but on the other hand, she respects the lives the Servants had while they were alive, so she also shows deep respect to them. She especially loves and respects the voyager and adventurer-type Heroic Spirits whom discovered unknown worlds. Even though she says “It’s nothing special…… since something like this was normal in Mosaic City…” in a calm manner, it seems she is so excited in Chaldea that blood rushes to her head, to the extent that she secretly has nosebleeds every single day from being so excited.

### Attitude towards Master

At first, because of her distrust and wariness towards Mages as a whole, Erice lashes out more fiercely at the Master, but if she understands that the Master as an individual is rather close to someone who was involved in the circumstances of murder and was dragged into a major incident, it will reach the point that she will emphasize with them and slowly relax her guard around them. Although Erice – who originally possesses a sense that was slightly out of sync with others’, as well as a feeling of distance from others – does not even particularly fret about that situation the Master faces in their life, it looks as if there are also scenarios where she will unexpectedly become embarrassed in front of the Master. She vaguely thinks if she can even build up a good relationship with the Master as a friend, but since she is unfamiliar with socializing and does not understand how to socialize with others, she does not know what is really the best thing to do in that case.

### Dialogue Examples

“Utsumi Erice. 14 years old. I’m from the Coastal City Akihabara… in a future that is some years from now. My job is to patrol my city. I must say, my occupation is called a Nightwatch, but for some reason… people call me the “Grim Reaper”… Eh? You think that’s pretty cool, among other things?… No way, I don’t t-think so…”
“I have to kill. I must kill more and more bad Servants.”
“Like I said… I think there are other matters to prioritize, but… if you say that it satisfies you, then… well… it would seem…”
“Be mowed down and thrown away… to the water’s edge!”
“Demon King (Erlkönig)!”{{n1}}
“Magic Bullet (Freischütz)!”{{n2}}
“Porca… miseria…”{{n3}}
“The hollow boat… drifts to Ashihara. This will be my umbilical cord. The Nuboko… of Yomotsu Ookami’s vessel. Having been delegated to rule over the wandering spirits of the deceased, I was granted the permission to undo. Because of the agreement made since the Age of Gods, 1000 people will head in the direction of the underworld. Now, let’s thrum, Ame-no-Sakahoko! Churn, churn… Churn, churn…”{{n4}}

### Character Image According to the Original Work

In a world after the end of a Holy Grail War in Japan in the near future, there is a 14-year-old girl named Erice who is serving as a Nightwatch in Akihabara, Mosaic City. Because of the stern way she works in hunting down Servants, she is called the “Grim Reaper” and is ostracized and feared by others as a result.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In a future history that is different from the course of history that Chaldea walks on, Erice throws herself into a Holy Grail War together with “Voyager”, the Servant last summoned into the world. Even Erice herself does not know the conclusion of that story.

Ever since early childhood, Erice has been possessed by evil spirits called “Dread Spirits”. That spiritual affliction appears as a mock substance in the form of black mucus that seeps out of her body surface. The spiritual affliction gradually became more serious, but she even adapted to it by treating it like a tool and personally naming it the “Demon King (Erlkönig)”, eventually becoming able to freely control it. While the Dread Spirits are also effective as a supersense that perceives bloodlust and signs of death for Erice, they constantly desire for a sacrifice, so if they are not satisfied, they will gnaw at her own body.

### General Armaments

Erice makes full use of the Ame-no-Nuboko replica as a long spear. She was relentlessly trained in spearmanship by the Servant Longinus.
Hand-to-hand combat with her own body reinforced with Magecraft.
Sniping and the like with magic bullets that were imitated.

### Connections with Characters

#### Voyager

“I’m not… his Master now. So that’s why it’s insensitive for me, and discourteous to both him and you, to cut into your conversations like this, but… you can’t leave someone like him alone. Please take good care of him for me.”

#### Caren

“I subconsciously happen to call her “Sensei”, although the other person sort of doesn’t mind much. My Sensei… is one of the people who had taken the trouble to guide me from my little self, who was just like a doll, to someone who is now living as a human being. But you know, she herself was an AI, not a human. Caren-sensei, who is close to the Original, was more intense than what I had imagined about her.”

#### Marie Antoinette

“She’s a dazzling person. I can’t face her straight with her like that. In my own world, in the past, I had killed that person’s son… so because of that, I completely feel indebted to her, no matter what. Though, perhaps there’s more to it than that. I looked at that person, who is pure in all respects, with suspicion without meaning to…”

#### Kijyo Kouyou

“It’s fine Kouyou-san, isn’t it? Although you’re very terrifying, you’re also someone who can be diligently relied upon.
It’s disappointing that she has no memory of me and Voyager, but even so, I want to be dependable to Kouyou-san.”

#### Francis Drake

“Someone who, as a single person, crossed the Seven Seas and discovered this planet. A special Hero to me.
Though I’m a little disturbed that in the end… he was a woman.”

#### Galahad

“To think that the one who fused with Mash-san is THE genuine Holy Knight Galahad. Is it a form of spirit possession different from the Heroic Spirit Possession (Possession) that I know of?… Although, it’d be nice if that’s seen as a desirable connection from Mash-san’s standpoint.”
