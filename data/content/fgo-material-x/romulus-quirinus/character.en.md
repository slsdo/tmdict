### Personality

Even while possessing the humanity of the Rome itself, which rules over the world, they are an existence which has attained godhood, thus they simultaneously possess the romanticism of humans and the detached nature of gods.
If the Heroic Spirit of the same name, Romulus, is a gentle Heroic Spirit who governs “reigns and prosperity”, then the Romulus who has taken this form represents the violent phenomenon that exists in human history, that being “the development and expansion of civilization”.
They are not a being who enjoys conflict, but they do not shy away from inflicting destruction for the sake of love.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Fundamentally no different than the Heroic Spirit with the same name, “Romulus”.
Their Master is, just like before, none other than Rome.
If the gaze of the Heroic Spirit with the same name is that of a father or grandfather, then the gaze of this Romulus could be said to come from an even higher place.

### Dialogue Examples

“These hands will take us to the ends of the world!”
“My love knows no bounds. Allow me to demonstrate───”
“Our arms reach everything, tear everything, and clear away everything! Eventually, they will reach beyond the stars in the skies!”
“Behold. The stars in the skies are giving their blessings. All things that the world (Rome), me (Rome), and you (Rome) love…… All encompassed by that is what we call the universe!”
“Roma…”

### Character Image

Rome itself is indeed romantic───
They are a human being who grew beyond the Age of Gods, while also understanding the love within human hearts as a fellow person.
They are the representation of all of that.

Born as the child of the War God Mars and the Beautiful Princess Silvia, Romulus was raised among the beasts, and in their youthful form, became the founding king who would lay the foundations for the great Roman Empire. Following that, they ascended to the heavens as one of the three supreme deities of Rome, enshrined in that figure as a concept given form, known as Quirinus.

They were a being worshipped as a god, and in the modern world, they are known as a symbol of the violent phenomenon that existed in human history’s ancient Roman Empire; “developing and expanding civilization”.
Much like the Heroic Spirit of the same name, who symbolises “reigns and prosperity”, Quirinus is a being who represents the possibility of humanity surpassing the Age of Gods.

As Romulus is conceptualised as the supreme being, the features of lifeforms or positions on this earth no longer apply.

At times they tear apart the world, while at others they clear the way for civilization, while loving humans as a human.
If their two arms of romance were compared to a spear, then they would be both too grand and too sharp.
An ordinary Spirit Origin would never suffice, so only with a Spirit Origin of the Crown Station can they truly be summoned.
In other words───
They are the Grand Lancer.

In the Atlantic Lostbelt, they manifested as a Grand Heroic Spirit for the first time.
Within a Chaldea-style summoning, they materialise as a normal Lancer, so naturally their Spirit Origin and spiritual rank suffer a significant downgrade.
Even so, they are doubtlessly an extraordinary existence.

The founding hero of Rome, Romulus, was previously limited to a human framework, but now they have finally revealed their aspect as a god.
Ordinarily, it would be impossible for a Divine Spirit to be summoned into a Grand-class Spirit Origin, but because they have a deep connection with human history, and because they became a supreme deity despite being human, they have become an ultra-exceptional existence, and so they were able to serve as the Grand Lancer in the Atlantic Lostbelt, after many miracles took place.

In the Atlantic Lostbelt ruled by the Machine Gods of Ancient Greek Mythology, many Heroic Spirits of the Human Order fought against the King of the Gods, Zeus. They were all of them destroyed.
Entrusting their hope in the Chaldea who would one day arrive, the Heroic Spirits mustered their full strength and left behind a single plan.
Their plan was “Operation God Destroyer”.
The summoning of the Heroic Spirit/Divine Spirit Romulus=Quirinus, the supreme deity of all mythologies, who has a human aspect and thus stands on the side of the Human Order, and who wields power equal to that of the King of the Greek Gods, Zeus, who is sometimes called omnipotent and omniscient, and who brandishes Authorities of thunder and lightning.

Chaldea eventually arrived, and “Operation God Destroyer” was completed.
Romulus=Quirinus materialised in the Lostbelt, fought alongside Chaldea, and defeated the Machine Gods of Olympus.

They vanished when the gods were destroyed.
It seemed like they would never again materialise in this world, as they had accomplished everything they needed to do…
However, the bonds they forged with the Master of Chaldea, and the records of their Spirit Origin in Novum Chaldea’s Trismegistus, it became possible to summon them in a state where they do not possess a Crown-rank Spirit Origin.
Once summoned, they will once again wield their luminous spear-like arms for the sake of the Human Order.

### Connections with Characters

#### Nero

My beloved child. You are the very glory of Rome.
I love you as if you were my younger sister.
At the same time, when I think of your final days alive, sadness tears at my chest.

#### Caligula

My younger brother, one who is like Rome, who was cursed by the Moon.
Loathsome gods. Loathsome Diana!

#### Caesar

Caesar, why didn’t you acknowledge your marriage openly?
What an unbelievable man, and at this stage too…

#### Orion (the one accompanied by Artemis)

She is the Goddess Diana, but not the Goddess Diana that I am familiar with.
I will not antagonise her, as I feel that she is the incarnation of Diana’s love, something completely decoupled from the Divine Body, the Aletheia{{n1}}.

#### Heracles

Though you are not my father, you are a man like one.
Perhaps one could say your way of being is Roman.

#### Altera

Because you love the god of war, I consider you to be no different from my younger sister…
However, you occasionally see that as civilization itself, and thus something to be killed (destroyed).
Suddenly, Romulus=Quirinus understands.
Is this what they call a yandere?

#### Boudica / Zenobia

The flames burning inside those women is Rome’s sin. My sin.

#### Zeus

Begone!

#### Ares (Mars)

Father!

#### Charlemagne

Don’t hold yourself back.
You too are a beloved Roman.

#### Constantine XI

Oh, my Roman. You fought brilliantly. Raise your head.
As long as humans embrace tales of romance, and reach for the skies, Rome will be eternal.

#### Voyager

Star-Child. You are the very form of the potential of humans to strive for the skies.
Precious, and magnificent.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} They actually say “アリスティア”, which perhaps more accurately is “Aristeia”, which refers to the climactic point in a heroic epic, when the hero has their most valiant battle. However, it’s imposed as furigana for “Divine Body”, which relates to the True Bodies, the Aletheia, of the Machine Gods in Chapter 5.2, which is アリスィア. Typo in the mats chat. We can also tell this is the intent because it’s very similar to Quirinus’ in-game line for Orion.
