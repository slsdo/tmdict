The order I got was for them to be young, and in a full-body, shiny suit of armour. The design of the full plate was unexpectedly difficult, as it was my third time designing it for the Fate series. On the other hand, the loose clothes in their first Ascension are my personal favourite, because they were easy to decide on and make for an excellent difference. The black arms are not meant to be gloves, but rather their bare skin. Since they’re a god, I decided it was appropriate to include a few mysterious elements like that. Another example would be the gravity manipulation-ish floating feeling.
The big thing on their back in their third Ascension is the Roma Converter (only I’ve called them that). The Roma Road is open. (Koyama Hirokazu)
