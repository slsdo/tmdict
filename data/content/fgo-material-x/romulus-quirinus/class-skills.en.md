### Magic Resistance: A

Possesses a high rank in the Magic Resistance skill.

### Independent Action: B+

Normally, no existence on earth should be able to fetter the highest-ranking King of the Godsâ€¦ however, Romulus=Quirinus has lowered their own rank.

### Divine Core of the King of Gods: B+

As the child of the war-god Mars, and because they were deified post mortem as Quirinus, the supreme deity of the whole of Roman mythology, Romulus unusually possesses a Divine Core within their Spirit Origin.
Ordinarily, the rank would be nonstandard, but it stopped at the rank of B+ for their summoning in Chaldea.
