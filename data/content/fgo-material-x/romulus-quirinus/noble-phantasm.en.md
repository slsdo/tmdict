Per Aspera ad Astra.
A great Noble Phantasm with the same essence as the one possessed by the Heroic Spirit of the same name, “All Things Lead to My Spear”.

The concept of “developing and expanding civilization” sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.
Their two romantic arms are like spears of light, and will split the world apart, clear a path for civilization, and will one day reach the stars in space─── while it’s a manifestation of the arrogant humans who control all of creation, at the same time, it’s the manifestation of the twinkle of those humans who dream of a yet-unseen future, and wish to continue progressing.
If it is used to attack, it will cause severe damage.

But should it be used for the sake of defence, or for the act of creation, it will demonstrate even more brilliance─── but that is fundamentally not how it is invoked in “FateGO”.

It’s possible this is one aspect, or perhaps one application, of a downsized nation-building Authority, or so Holmes and da Vinci conjecture.

Nine Lives - Roma.
The combat method devised by Heracles, the great hero of Greek mythology. Combat information was transmitted by the war-god Mars (Ares), who watched over all of Heracles’ fearsome battles─── or perhaps it sublimated in this new form because of the folklore relating to Romulus where “Heracles is their father”.
School of Heracles, Roman branch.
A flurry of battering fists, which resemble spears of light, which massacres even lifeless monsters, and makes them gush into the starry skies and glitter.

A continuously-active-type Noble Phantasm.
In this work, it is expressed as a skill.
When its True Name is released, it unleashes a battery of ardent light, but in “FateGO” this is fundamentally not used.

Moles Necessariae{{n1}}.
The tragic legend in which Romulus killed their beloved brother Remus with their own hands, manifested as bloodstained ramparts of love.
By dividing space through the manifestation of “ramparts of light”, this Barrier Noble Phantasm can defend the interior of the walls. These ramparts manifest by surging out of the ground instantly, so by adjusting the location of the manifestation, it is possible to slice apart the target.
While the effects of a True Name release are fundamentally not used in “FateGO”, you might be able to see a glimpse of it during their Extra Attacks.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Traditionally, this has been TL’d as “Moles Necessrie”, but because I’m a little rat man, I did a little digging on Latin (not like i needed the excuse), and found two things: the first is that “Necessrie” isn’t a word. Like, at all. The other thing is that necessāriae, the feminine genitive of necessārius, “necessary, unavoidable, inevitable” exists, and fits the Japanese much more than “necessrie”.
ネチェサーリエ - Nechesaarie - necessāriae
Now, I’m loath to use Ecclesiastic Latin pronunciations, but frankly this just seems more accurate on the whole.
For the curious, I would translate “Moles Necessāriae” as “Necessity’s Burden”, or perhaps “An Inevitable Burden”.
