Are those the legs of a water strider? You know, the insect?
No no, not at all, it’s totally different. It’s more like huntsman’s greaves but with mountain climbing-style spikes. I heard water striders’ legs were totally covered in hair, and they have two claws? And this allows them to float on water?

Orion is someone who Artemis described as having a beautiful face, and being all-around handsome, but there was never a chance of him being the sort of slim, delicate man which is handsome by today’s standards.
After all, no matter how you view his legends, he was always more of a gorilla than a wise man; a muscle-headed macho-man who would go on to beat up countless people (and even that’s an understatement).

There’s also the fact that just looking at the constellations, it’s…difficult to use them as a design source without first complementing really large parts just using your imagination anyway, to be honest.
(As an aside, in the first draft of the floating bear Orion in Artemis’ third ascension, all the stars of the constellation were included. When the staff made it into a sprite, the stars on his arm were cut. I still don’t know the reason for this.)
Ever since Hollow Ataraxia, it’s been my personal impression from characters like Hercules, Stheno, and Euryale, that when it came to Ancient Greece, in the world of Fate, the elements that became really popular might have been “big muscly men, and loli women”. Not like I know if there’s any truth to that. Either way, when I submitted a sketch of this mountain of muscle, it was approved almost without hesitance. The one thing that was altered was the face. Originally, his face was pretty wild. He had scars over both eyes, even. Well, if I’d gone with that legend, the design might have been too graphic. In the end, he was given a cute face, even with his neck being super-thick and like a big lump of muscles.
Speaking of, people with this many muscles tend to have a narrow range of motion due to the muscles being in the way. Inevitably, the same must be true for this guy.
He can’t exactly stand at attention. I think it helps with his cuteness.
His hair is pretty stiff and unruly, mostly because Artemis would have copied the makeup of his hair when she created her human body, or something like that. Consequently, it means if he were to grow his hair long, it would look really similar to Artemis’.

The belt is a gift from Artemis, that’s why it’s a bit more sci-fi. The lights coming out in the second ascension represent the particularly bright stars in the Orion constellation. The light on the right shoulder is red because it represents the red supergiant star Betelgeuse.
The club design is made with respect with the most primitive and painful sci-fi club design I personally know of. The second ascension is the baseline for the whole design. I also assume he would just throw the club.
I’m honestly not sure where the trend of a costume change in the second ascension came from, but in Orion’s case, I drew him with this wild idea as if Artemis’ love (also an understatement) was encroaching on him, or maybe as a reminder of sorts for him. (I-IV)
