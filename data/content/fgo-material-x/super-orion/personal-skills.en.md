### Pressure of the Moon Goddess: EX

Heavy pressure that Orion receives in the name of affection from his lover(?) Artemis. The tremendous pressure buffs Orion, enhancing his physique. All stats rank up, including magical energy and LUK. His STR is doubled.

### Stout Arm of Brutality: B+

Orion had powerful arms. So strong were his arms that he is said to have strangled a lion with them. Even demonic beings and Phantasmal Beasts flee in terror of his brute strength. Tearing coins in two is a cakewalk for him, and a blow from him is capable of shattering Cerberus’ forehead. His strength is truly peerless.

### Tri-Star Archer: A+

As he was touted to be the greatest hunter in Greece, combined with Artemis’ blessing, his skill is said to be the very best on Earth. By gaining his constellation’s legend of the three stars (the Tri-Star), he has gained powerful archery skills that overwhelm even other heroes from different ages.

But…there is one fatal flaw to this skill. It is that those who are beloved of the stars are also beloved of the gods (especially goddesses). Thus, his fate may have already been sealed at that point…point…point… (echoes)
