Artemis Agnós.
Artemis’ love pours down upon Orion, temporarily enhancing him. The incredible intensity of her love is felt both physically and psychologically.
It is an anti-army Noble Phantasm because its blessing is sufficient to grant one man the strength of an entire army. The sheer magnitude of its power would cause a normal person to explode, but Orion only suffers muscle aches.

Orion Orkos.
An attack that nullifies all defensive skills and Noble Phantasms if the target is demon-kin or a Demonic Beast.

If used while summoned as Grand Archer, it has the added effect of causing any beast to fall within his reach. It is also effective against enemies that spawn infinitely, automatically killing them so long as they are in range.
In FGO, this Noble Phantasm was only used in the Main Scenario of the game.

Ortygia Amore Mio.
A special Noble Phantasm that should not exist under normal circumstances. It was created explicitly for Artemis in the Fifth Lostbelt, though it meant even discarding the position of Grand Archer.
In exchange for his own life, he shot down the mechanical goddess Artemis. An arrow that can only be released once by unifying a bow forged by processing Achilles’s armor, Paris turned into an arrow, and a Command Spell (boost) from the Master.
In FGO, this Noble Phantasm was only used in the Main Scenario of the game.
