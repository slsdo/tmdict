### Independent Action: EX

Earned for qualifying for Grand Archer.

### Blessing of the Sea God: B

A subspecies skill of Divinity.
Enables him to walk on water as well as remain underwater indefinitely. He can also make it rain at will, and Orion used this skill mainly to try to charm the ladies, saying things like, “The rain makes a normally cheery man seem like he’s crying.”
(This turns out not to have been a particularly effective tactic.)

### Curse of Scorpio: D

One of Orion’s many causes of death.
He hates scorpions so much that the constellation Orion retreats whenever Scorpio approaches it in the sky.
