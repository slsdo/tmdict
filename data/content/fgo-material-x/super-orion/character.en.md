### Personality

After remaining in the dark for a while, Orion makes an unannounced entrance.
Not much changed from when he was a bear. Actually, it’s only his weird form.
He is open-minded, accommodating and unconcerned with the small details. He also loves women.

### Dialogue Examples

“Man… This body is a real bother, isn’t it?
It’s actually kinda funny if you take a step back and think about it.
I mean, how did it even come to this?
I’m a Servant, for crying out loud!
Wait… Is it a curse from my name?
Is it all because my name stems from ’to urinate’{{n1}}?
Hahaha, I see, hahahaha!
What kind of awful origin of a name is that!?” “Master, this may be abrupt but I was caught cheating, so sorry, but I’ll retreat for a bit!”
“I won’t let anyone fell you but me!
No one!!
No one but I can draw this bow!
No one but I can shoot you down!
I am moved by my own will, and it’s by my own will that I will strike you down!”

### Historical Image · Character Image (Written by Morise Ryou)

Orion, whose name means “to urinate,” was born to the sea god Poseidon and Euryale (not the goddess Euryale).
He always bragged that he could take down any beast, but an incident with some ladies caused him to go blind one day.
Relying only on the sound of a hammer, he set out to sea and met the goddess of dawn, Eos. With her help, he was able to recover his sight.
It bears mentioning that this was only the beginning of his trouble with goddesses.

The sun god Apollo did not approve of his younger sister Artemis falling in love with Orion, and so he tricked Artemis into shooting Orion, who was out at sea, by challenging her to shoot a man named Candaon. Artemis successfully hit her lover, Orion, and it was said that she hugged his corpse and wept.
She considered asking for help from Asclepius, who was able to revive the dead, but he was killed by Zeus’s thunderbolt before she could reach him. With no other choice, Artemis sublimated Orion to the stars.
During winter, three dazzling stars (the Tri-Star) can be seen. They are known as Orion’s Belt.

### In Atlantis

Originally, Superhuman Orion obtained the crown position of Grand Archer, having been summoned by the Counter Force in response to the presence of a Beast.
That said, because the summoning occurred just a little too late, the original assault unit had already been dissolved, and so Orion had no other choice than to remain in Atlantis.

However, during that time, Artemis ended up noticing Orion’s presence there.
In fearing his power—or perhaps due to other feelings towards him—she ended up sending her terminal vessel to his side.
Following negotiations with her, Orion reluctantly agreed to enter a non-aggression pact.
As long as he did not make a move, Artemis vowed to not lay a hand on him either.
During the time that followed, Artemis’ terminal seemingly disappeared from Atlantis, only acting as observer.

When the Chaldean party arrived, and Orion finally met with the Master, he first refused to help due to this pact, but sensing that Artemis was ready to make a move he eventually resolved to assist regardless.

And so, on that final island, Orion made use of the bow and arrow granted to him by Hephaistos, and unleashed his Noble Phantasm.
Even so, he was unable to reach Artemis.
In that bleak moment, Paris offered to make an arrow from himself.
Having been given a truly final chance, with everything on the line, Orion relinquished his crown,
and created his third Noble Phantasm using the best Saint Graph possible.

But that Noble Phantasm was never one born of hatred; rather one born of a wish to see the woman he loved be granted a peaceful slumber.
Thus, the hunter of love shot down the moon.

### General Armaments

Bow and arrow.
Otherwise, just clubs and stuff to bonk people with.

### Connections with Characters

#### All women, past present and future (with some exceptions)

I! Love! Y──

#### Jason / Achilles

“I don’t at all agree with the media’s portrayal of us as ’a trio of greek muscleheads’. Well, I guess it’s not that off the mark, but…”

#### Atlantis Argonauts

“Obviously, I don’t remember anything from Atlantis, but those guys did some great stuff, and I genuinely admire them. We all get along pretty well, including the aforementioned duo of blockheads. Heey! (A greeting that was popular but a single moment)”

#### Artemis (Pan-Human History)

“Keep your distance, don’t get too close…” that’s the motto which Orion has lived his days by in Chaldea, but when it came to his attention that they would celebrate their golden wedding anniversary, he just had a face like ( ﾟ Д ﾟ )

#### Orion (bear form)

“Bear…a bear…
I’m….a bear…
No, wait…it looks a bit like some new trendy character, doesn’t it?
It’s fluffy and squishy, I think it’ll be big with the youngsters, don’t you think!?
It’s not? I see…”

#### Artemis (Lostbelt)

Supposing that woman were to ever awaken from her gentle slumber and recognize him once more, he already knows what to tell her:
“About that very last bit…can we just forget about it? It’s kinda embarrassing.”

(All the Atlantean Argonauts always incessantly gave him verbal abuse in the style of “Are you insane!?”, “We should just tie this guy up and sacrifice him to Artemis!”, “Get your shit together already!”, and so on.)

Whatever the case, he just wishes for her to have a long, gentle sleep.
Even if, now, not a single trace of that existence remains.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The idea is that Ovid posited that “Hyries called him Urion, because of his conception: the first letter has now lost its ancient sound”. The greek word in question would actually be “ouron” (urine) which gives the verb "ourein" (to urinate).
