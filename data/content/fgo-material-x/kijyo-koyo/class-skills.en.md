### Madness Enhancement: A

This level of madness enhancement has affected her mind and robbed her of speech processes, as well as turning her body into that of a beastâ€™s. Despite that, since she can control her berserk emotions, she can maintain a gentle and rational state of being.
In her Kijyo-style court noble appearance, she regains her ability to speak, but there is still a danger of her going easily berserk.

### Magic Resistance: C

Negates spells with a chant of two verses or less. Cannot defend against something more complex, like high magecraft or ritual curses.
