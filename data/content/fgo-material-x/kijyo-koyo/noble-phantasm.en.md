Autumn-Leaf Viewing.
Koyo’s life full of regrets, betrayal, robbery, and ultimately her own death as an oni at the end…all embodied in flaming, vengeful hatred that assails the target. At the same time, it is a cruel Noble Phantasm that inflicts great pain upon Koyo as she is rooted to the ground in order not to be swept away by her Madness Enhancement.
