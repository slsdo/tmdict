It is everybody’s cute grandma. Although Europa is a very famous heroine whose name is also the origin of the word Europe, apart from the episode where… she was seduced by Zeus – who took the form of a bull and ran across Europe with Europa on his back – and was then later blessed with Zeus’ children on the island of Crete, there is not much information about her. About the order I received, it was for something futuristic to give people the impression that Europa is from the same world as Odysseus, but she turned out like this in the end because I ended up drawing a woman that was cute and fluffy instead. I was a little worried about the matter of ‘Will they allow me to expose her underwear to this extent?’, but when I looked at the other characters, I thought ‘The concept of exposure in FGO must not adhere to common sense, doesn’t it?…’ (redjuice)
