### Personality

A princess who is as compassionate as she is airy. Carefree, and gentle. Europa’s disposition is often like that, and she does not care about trivial matters. Whether she is smiling kindly, being frivolous, or is somewhat sleepy, her reaction to something will generally be any one of these three that is usually seen by others. Even when Divine Beasts and Giants appear before her eyes, she is not so much as perturbed, and even when she was kidnapped by the Chief God, her temperament did not show panic; should that be seen as her being absent-minded, or should that be seen as… her possessing the personality of a Divine Consort that is snuggling up close to the Supreme Being?…

Europa’s awareness as a Grand Mother is stronger than her awareness as a Divine Consort, and she seems to perceive all the European Heroic Spirits who lived after her time period as her “grandchildren” and “great-grandchildren”.

“It is implausible that she is even properly aware of the reality around her.“ Such is the remark from Hera, who was both a Goddess and a Divine Consort of the Atlantic Lostbelt. But even when Europa herself heard that, it is said that she was smiling, with a friendly grin too.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Europa perceives her Master as another of her own children (grandchildren). In addition to that, it seems like she thinks of them as a considerably young child, so she will come to pamper them with all her heart.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m Europa. Nice to meet you.”
“Talos, Talos, are you here?”
“Let’s have teatime, alright?”
“Come. Good child, good child; let me hug you tightly.”
“Right, let’s do our best, okay?”
“…… Munyamunya (mumbling incomprehensibly) …”

### Character Image

A princess who appears in Greek Mythology. Europa is known as a Divine Consort who was united in marriage with the Chief God Zeus. She is the daughter born between the Phoenician King Agenor and Telephassa. It is also said that she is the daughter of Phoenix, Agenor’s son, but at any rate, there is no doubt that she was born a princess.

The being who transformed into the form of a white bull and gave Europa a ride on its back, before it took her all the way to the island of Crete in a way that is almost the same as abduction, was definitely Zeus, the Supreme Being in the Greek mythological system. Europa was united in marriage with the God Zeus, and she gave birth to three sons. It is said that these children are the Cretan King Minos, the Lycian King Sarpedon, and Radamanthus, who, along with Minos, became a Judge of the Underworld after their deaths.

Europa was given three gifts by the Chief God Zeus. Namely, they are the bronze Talos, a hound, and a javelin. After her death, Europa was deified, and the white bull that gave her a ride on its back became the constellation Taurus. One theory is that the name Europa is considered to be the origin of the word “Europe”.

In the Fifth Lostbelt, even though her materialization as a Servant of the Human Order was realized, Europa was unable to go against the King of the Lostbelt/Chief God Zeus, and she was made to rule over the people of the Interstellar City on the Mountain Range – Olympus as a priestess who spoke for Zeus. However, in actuality, she was lending her aid to the Godbreaker Alliance secretly, even when she understood the danger it posed to herself.

Regarding her materialization in Chaldea, it seems Europa does not remember the events of the Lostbelt, but————

Supposing that, in the case where she learns of the events in the Fifth Lostbelt, Europa will, without a doubt, close her lips, quiver out of sorrow, and shed tears. For the numerous lives that were lost… and for the wishes a pair made from the bottom of their hearts as they cuddled close to each other.

### General Armaments

The white bull, which is Europa’s mount and a Constantly Invoked-Type Noble Phantasm.

Europa herself always holds a lyre-type console in her arms. (Europa thinks it is just an ordinary lyre, but in reality, it is a console that is also usable as a lyre.)
