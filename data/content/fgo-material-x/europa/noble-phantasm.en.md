Syfri tou Talos (Hammer of Talos). One of the Noble Phantasms given to Europa by the Great God Zeus. An automatic machine from the Age of Gods. The bronze monster Talos.

A superweapon cast by the God Hephaestus – one of the Twelve Olympians – and presented to Europa by the Chief God. A Noble Phantasm whose reason for existence is to be used in providing Europa its unconditional protection. Its durability is tremendous, to the point that not even the gods can easily destroy it. While Talos was originally not a giant, but a “monster”, it has acquired the form of a “giant” in the present time because of the situation where it was confused for being the Colossus of Rhodes, which was spread around to the people.

Talos automatically perceives hostilities and moves to exterminate them. When it gets mad, its limbs become red-hot before it attacks. If they are normal organisms, they will instantly evaporate from those attacks.

In this work, Talos is summoned to attack on behalf of Europa as well as on the occasion of this Noble Phantasm’s True Name Release, and the moment it perceives the presence of hostilities, it instantly becomes furious. Becoming red-hot, it violently throws its scorching hot, tightly clenched fist that has an extremely large mass against the enemy line.

Before, at Crete, Europa would often have fun by sitting on Talos’ shoulder to go for a ride, but as for Talos, in the circumstances where it would become red-hot when it gets mad while Europa is on its shoulder, it would awfully become troubled. “Please quickly get down, my Mistress.”

Someone who Talos is poor with is the Witch Medea. In the Age of Gods, one of Talos’ heels, which is its weak point, was attacked by Medea, and as a result, the ichor within its body – the blood of the gods which is also its source of Magical Energy – leaked out completely before it stopped functioning.

Chionis Tauros (Snow Bull). A Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type. A Noble Phantasm with an outward appearance that closely resembles————the white bull that was the avatar of the Great God Zeus. It is a Noble Phantasm given to Europa by the Chief God Zeus in order to protect his beloved, and it originally had the form of a hound as told in the legends, but due to Europa saying “It might be nice if your form is the same as my dear’s. You would be very adorable, and it would be very pleasant, as if you’re like a pillow”, its form changed.

The Noble Phantasm constantly protects Europa while she is riding on its back. It is feasible for it to gallop across every place, even over the surface of the sea. This Noble Phantasm is the reason why Europa can materialize as a Rider. If its True Name is released, it will bravely run around and rampage across the enemy camp. Furthermore, the Skill “The White Bull of the Chief God” is being endowed to Europa because of this Noble Phantasm.
