### Princess of Purity: B

A Skill that denotes the absoluteness of the mind and body. Besides mitigating effects that work on the mind, it also prevents one from gaining weight no matter how much they eat. It is primarily a composite Skill too that comprises the Beautiful Princess Skill, which brings and attracts to one the people in their surroundings.

### Affection of the Chief God: A+

Europa is deeply beloved by Zeus, the Supreme Being within Greek Mythology. A Skill that brings many divine protections. Simultaneously, it secretly carries a risk where the Goddess Hera, who is Zeus’ wife, might be enraged that Europa is being bestowed such protections by Zeus————but Europa herself pays no heed to such a thing at all. For as far as Europa is concerned, Hera is a magnificent goddess who should be loved and respected.

### The White Bull of the Chief God: C

It is said that the white bull – that is to say, the God Zeus – that Europa met is a Divine Beast that is endowed with a powerful charm effect, the bull itself being the constellation Taurus, and it instantly attracts those who see it.

A Skill associated with the bull that Europa is riding on rather than Europa herself.
