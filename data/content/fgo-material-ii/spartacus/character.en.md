### Personality

We love Uncle Spartacus, who always smile with a happy grin. Well, always smiling no matter what the condition is is just going to be scary instead….
To eradicate oppressors; such an attitude is surprisingly gentlemanly. He is an austere warrior, with no obsession towards battle and completely without interest for riches or prestiges.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As long as it is not oppressive, as long as it is not high-handed, as long as it is not a a coercion purported as an order-----as long as the Master does not do anything that would make him feel displeasure, it should be alright. Probably. Maybe.

### Dialogue Examples

“HAHAHAHAHAHA! OPPRESSORS!”
“HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! LET US GO! MY LOVE IS EXPLODING!”
“Berserker, Spartacus. A bit sudden this may be, but are you an oppressor?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A gladiator of Ancient Rome who had raised a rebellion.
His name is Spartacus. Together with his comrades, he made an escape from the gladiator training grounds and organized a rebel army.
Before long, many other gladiators and slaves gather beneath him, as they became a large army.
It marked the beginning of the Third Servile War.

The rebel army swelling in ranks, commanded by Spartacus, had managed to secure consecutives victories, but before long Rome also organized its own large army.
The rebel army, which had scarce battle experience on top of having children and elderly within it, was unable to oppose them, and was annihilated.{{n1}}
Spartacus’ remains had not been found; one theory states that it had been mangled by the fierceness of the battle.

……Spartacus’ battle had almost always been against the strong. They were overwhelmed by the soldiers of Rome known for their strength even in number.
Within the pressure of facing such powerful enemies, of the request for aid from his subordinates, of the death of everyone who had gathered here should he misled them.
Spartacus had laughed as he continued fighting.

He is not fond of fighting, nor is he fond of victory.
It is simply that his forte is in finding a motive to not lose.
Consequently, he understands-----that in this world, there are battles in which one simply must not lose.

He does not hate pain. He does not detest despair. To begin with, those are things that exist within this world to shackle us.
Future, hope, wish. They are all but a temporary consolation for the mind. One cannot survive if one does not continue fighting.
Fight, his muscles call out. Howl, his diaphragm trembles. Even if your sword you tightly hold breaks, even if your knees are broken, fight, fight, fight!

If it is for the sake of his conviction, he would even without hesitation kill his Master. Due to that, he is known as one of the worst Servant one could ever summon.
But likewise, if the Master that he ought to rebel against is simply someone who learn from being weak and challenges other Servant as the weak, the Spartacus would gladly fight for their sake.
That being said, his trait of “choosing the most difficult of paths as his course of action” means he would still be a trouble-----
