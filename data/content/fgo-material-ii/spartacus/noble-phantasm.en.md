Crying Warmonger.
A continuously activated type Noble Phantasm.
It is able to convert a portion of damage inflicted by the enemy into magic energy and accumulate it within the body.
The amassed magic energy can be used to boost Spartacusâ€™ ability. Against strong Servants and such, perhaps even his very body itself would end up being transformed.
In a different work, he eventually becomes a meat lump of amorphous creature, completely destroying a giant fortress with one blow.
