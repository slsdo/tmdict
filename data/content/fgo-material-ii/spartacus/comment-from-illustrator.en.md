It’s kinda hard to modify such a cheerful character for the ascension, but do all of you realize his rotund eyes peeking from the dark hole on the mask on his last ascension? Also, all of his differing expressions are based on his smiling face, so it was really hard on me…or so I thought, but it ended up enormously smooth. Also, I’m proud of how sexy his hip is on his initial stage, so you need to check it out! (Konoe Ototsugu)
