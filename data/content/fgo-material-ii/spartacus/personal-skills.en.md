### Honor of Suffering: B ⮕ B+

When Spartacus’ body as a Servant is healed by means of magic, the required magic energy consumption is reduced to a fourth of how much it normally would take.
Also, even without the usage of magic for each time a period elapses he is automatically healed.

### Indomitable Will: A

The exceedingly firm will that will never, ever yield against any kind of pain, despair, or situation.
Possesses a resistance against physical and mental damage. However, said resistance does not hold against illusion sorts of attacks induced by others. For example, there would be a resistance against damage from “falling to a pitfall”, but there would be none against “an illusiton that makes the pitfall looks like the ground”.
