### Personality

Although Santa Alter has the personality of Saber Alter as she is now, the fastidiousness within that personality has somewhat changed to a frank way of doing things due to being bestowed the post of Santa. As Santa, her dreams and ideals of being merry and scattering smiles has resulted in her heart of ice, as if it was permafrost, being removed. Nonetheless, there are no changes in her Spartan doctrines, that being unaffected and sincere. She runs about for the sake of giving presents to good children, and although she gives punishments to bad children, she throws presents to them later on after they become good children.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Santa Alter gathers unconditional trust in the Master and tells them of an aspiration, of playing an active role as Santa together. The thickness of that trust is an important part, and yet, extremely harsh————to the extent that the Master is entrusted the role of reindeer, the central part of Llamrei II. And it goes without saying that the Master chosen as her reindeer will be anticipating heavy labour extending over a period of one week. Although Alter is greatly pleased with herself as Santa, there is absolutely no need for the Master to interrupt that mood. Because there is no need to speak well of her as a Santa. If one says something the likes of “You’re an excellent Miss Santa, aren’t you?” to sympathize with her success, one will think that it might be the day the sleigh rises to the stratosphere.

### Dialogue Examples

“Merry, excuse me for entering from the chimney. Santa Claus’ elder sister has arrived to comply with the summoning. Now, are you my reindeer?”
“I am pleased with this appearance. I will never change my clothes.”
“I sealed the state of Saber. I am a Rider who mounts on the Master called ‘Reindeer’. There is no more than a gust of a violent wind that comes out on the holy night… Ooh, I see you are getting excited.”
“Sink into the holy night! Excalibur Morgaaaan————! (Humming of Jingle Bells follows)”

### Role within the Game

Enter “Miss Almost Weekly Santa Alter”.

Artoria Alter, being resolved to wipe out her own image, took on this form and attempted to carry out activities as the Ally of Children/Santa Claus. The sack she holds in her hand is packed with handpicked presents that she spent one whole year to save up.

Although Alter has changed into the Rider Class, it does not mean that there are extreme changes that were made. Her weight has increased due to the weight of the presents. The lack of futility in her speeches and conducts and her cool-headed character closely resembles Alter, but her aspiration towards Santa Claus that exists in her foundation is making her just a little more kind.

### Connections with Characters

#### Elizabeth (Halloween)

An eyesore for she is the same Festival Event Servant-type as Santa Alter. Santa will turn her into a dragon steak for everyone.

#### Asterios

Because it is said to be unreasonable to get somebody to follow her lead during Christmas, Santa Alter feels an obligation. The present delivered last is obviously a crown for Asterios.
