### Intuition: A

The ability to always “feel” the most suitable development for oneself during combat.

Speaking of Alter, although she has attained more endurance than quickness, more power than speed, and became more insensitive than sensitive, for Santa Alter, she has no such stereotypes. For the objective of swiftly delivering presents to the children even in one second, that sixth sense is rising to its highest level.

#### Magical Energy Burst: A-

Speaking of Alter, although she has a dark aura hanging in the air around her, as if to say, “That battery, isn’t it leaking out?”, that sort of property is unnecessary for Santa. Since the presents must not be damaged, she is intentionally lowering the rank of her Magical Energy Burst.

“Why can’t you usually show that thoughtfulness, Miss Santa?”

#### Saint’s Gift: EX{{n1}}

A Skill acquired by turning completely into Santa Claus. One can give presents, thereby enriching hearts.

But because the design of the presents subtly differs even from what the targeted persons requested for, the effect of this is not able to go that far in fulfilling the targets’ expectations. One could even say that she has the natural talent for making choices that subtly perturb the traumas of the recipients greatly.
