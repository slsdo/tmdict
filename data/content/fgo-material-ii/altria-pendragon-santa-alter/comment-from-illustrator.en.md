Out of the simple thought where we want to do an event that differs from the usual Christmas Events, Santa Alter was referred to first of all. Well, when I was trying to get into her design, a design that gets through the words called “Santa Alter” could not easily come into sight, and that proved to be very difficult. Concerning the result, I am thinking, ‘I wonder if I came to indicate in one way or another a “Miss Santa who differs from the usual” that I aimed for in the beginning.’ (Takeuchi Takashi)
