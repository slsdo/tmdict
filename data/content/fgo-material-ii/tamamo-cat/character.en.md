### Personality

A wild beast-like existence that one doesn’t know what she will do or want to do.

Since she is Berserker, communication is basically impossible.

She’s only interested in fun and delicious things, and enjoy daily hunting life freely.

Despite being aggressive, it’s actually “Thinking about it is troublesome so I’ll just beat it up” mindset she has. If you explain the situation to her in the easiest way to understand, you might somehow able to convince her to cooperate.

Because she is the offshoot of Tamamo-no-Mae, she also possess the power to perceive the principle of things and see the truth, she just does not say anything.

The parts that are not twisted, she is even more reliable than Tamamo-no-Mae herself when it comes to understanding.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Conversation is pointless, as you can’t comprehend her to make a response.

All she wants is to have fun and eat delicious food, but her pride as a wild beast means that she is forever loyal to those she considers her “lord.”

After the contract is formed, Tamamo Cat will become your earnest guardian beast who simply wants to help her Master.

Cat prioritizes her Master’s wellbeing and happiness, ignoring her own.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am a member of the Tamamo Nine, Tamamo Cat! I end my lines with woof, my hobby is running a cafe, my favorite thing is carrot. I’m unsettled without them.”

“AHAHAHAHA” (when stabbing enemies)

“Well this is difficult…”

“How about cat language?”

“Or should I go with dog?”

“With that, I’m taking a carrot as reward!”

### Role within the Game

A member of the Tamamo Nine.

After Tamamo-no-Mae went through 1000 years of training to regain divine status she regained all tails, then when she returned to 1 tail form she cut off the other 8. Each of them obtained divine status as bunrei of Tamamo and become heroic spirits. This is the crystallization of Tamamo-no-Mae’s (relatively) pure aspect.

While the Tamamo Nine are just sad existences to be defeated in “Fate/Extra” series, in FGO when she meet an extraordinary lord she’s the first of them to change mind.

Based on Neko Arc{{n1}}. She is not involved in the main story. If that time comes, it will be the end of FGO.

Her cooking skill is better than the Original. It’s probably due to the result of working part-time at a maid cafe as a training ground.

### Connections with Characters

#### Tamamo-no-Mae

The Original must be defeated, but a wise Cat knows that even if she managed to beat the Original, it won’t solve anything. Fighting is meaningless.

### Atalanta

Hoho, a Mediterranean Sea cat huh…You’re not very fleshy. I’m worried, do you eat dried sardines properly?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Neko Arc is the gag character cat version of Arcueid Brunestud from Tsukihime. Tamamo Cat is basically Neko Tamamo.
