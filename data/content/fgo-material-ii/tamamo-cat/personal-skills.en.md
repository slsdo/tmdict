### Witchcraft: E

Dakini’s Divine Methods. Originally she mastered this powerful witchcraft, but when turning into this form she forgot all of them.

### Shapeshift: B

To mold a borrowed body. Technique used by Chinese millennial fox yokai identified with Tamamo-no-mae. It was used by Daji to possess/transform during the Yin-Zhou revolution (described in Fengshen Yanyi - Investiture of the Gods). Due to past trauma, it is normally restricted. But “self-discipline”, “self-derision”, “self-control” are not in her dictionary. Rather, all she has is “self-destruction”.

### Monstrous Strength: B

Ability of magic/demon beasts. Increase her physical strength. Fairly compatible right? She is excited. It’s explosive wild power!.
