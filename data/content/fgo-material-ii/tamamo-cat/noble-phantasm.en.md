Sansan Nikkou Hiruyasumi Shuchinikurin.
Derived from the Suiten Nikkou Amaterasu Yano Shizuishi. The “Wine Pool and Meat Forest”{{n1}} is a torture game of “releasing humans into a forest full of tigers”, but its meaning in the modern era has changed. The wild power of Tamamo Cat unleashed on the enemies, making them not feel so good. After that Tamamo Cat will take a nap, she will take a break for 1 turn but her HP is recovered. One must sleep after a workout and a meal, right?
