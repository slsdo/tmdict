Since Chaos or Order is fine, I drew her with no plan at all. But similar to Elizabeth her battle sprite cannot be changed at the moment, so the thought of her stucking in naked apron forever is oops. And then I messed up the words on her omelette rice (the maid ascension form). I wanted to write “TAMAMO-chan” or “TAMAMO-nyan” but it became “TAMAMO-nhan”. I can’t read. I just realized that when writing this comment. I’m sorry. I’m sorry!(Wada Arco).
