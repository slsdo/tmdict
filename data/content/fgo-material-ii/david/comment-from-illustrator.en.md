He is a character who I took to do his design years ago, but now, David appears in FateGO! It turns out that, because I began from the fact that my drawings were opposite to the drawings of my old self, it was difficult to deliver the drawings in a certain senseâ€¦ (haha). From his original clothes (second stage), I reached a decision of taking off and putting on clothes for his other stages to become what they are now. Although he is a useless father, please treat him well from now on. (Ginka)
