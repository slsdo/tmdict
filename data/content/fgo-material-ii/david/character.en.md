### Personality

A refreshing, super-talented prodigy who does not be at his wits’ end with matters. On one hand, David treats God first and foremost over all other things, whereas on the other hand, he is a thorough realist. He does not consider himself as someone who views his summoning as a resurrection of himself, but namely a summoning of someone who possesses the spirit of David himself; however, he also does not openly feel a sense of inferiority in existing as that kind of person. There is no difference in being a messenger of God in either the present time or during his own lifetime, for he holds a view where it is pleasant for him if he can feel the grace of God, no matter what kind of person he is. At the time of being summoned as a Heroic Spirit, he will wield his power to the maximum extent without holding back that power from anyone. Furthermore, bringing alongside his body is the knowledge he absorbed in greed, knowledge related to the history of humanity and the advancement of technology from the time after his death to the moment of him arriving in the present time.

A wise man who is not hostile thoughtlessly, and also, one who shows a calm behaviour towards anyone as well. Since everyone, no matter who it is, is bestowed a role by God, David deals with this matter with respect. At least, David himself intends to act in accordance with such. He advocates without hesitation that it is useless and a fruitless effort for people to do battle while held captive by the grudges of their past. Although he does not regard women and children as part of one’s military strength, towards warriors – towards people who have resolved themselves for the king, that is very much not the case. Being a king and a shepherd who has also gotten used to waiting upon people, he even grew accustomed to serving others from his experience as a harpist.

Because his flesh and bones are permeated with the importance of wealth and the value of finance, David is shrewd in the management of assets/funds. Even plots of land are important in making a living as a king. Money is also important. Although people’s hearts are something hard to grasp, money can be harvested and grasped with rationality. And given that human nature is something that can be controlled with money, it was David’s style to take into consideration that the management of assets is surely essential.

And then. While he indeed appears to be a hero, David is weak towards women with nice bodies. Something he always starts talking about is wanting to go out to meet his wife, among other things. He truly does not regret about the matter of him stealing another person’s spouse, Bathsheba (who became the mother of Solomon), a beautiful wife of one of his subordinates who he deliberately murdered. Also, because the devotion of the beautiful Abishag was something very pleasant to him as she got to soothe his solitude around the time of him being in an old age, David completely possesses a terribly unmanageable sense of values where a beautiful woman that is to his liking = Abishag. He goes into a decision of usually viewing one as Abishag should she happen to have a nice body or be a beautiful woman, but because of his bitter memory of the battle against the giant Goliath, any women that are taller than him are proven to be NG (No Good) no matter what. He loves to perform on the harp (gifted in doing so) and dance (very poor in doing so).

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

David deals with anyone without being two-faced. Especially towards his Master, he is being frank from the beginning. Rather than calling it sincerity, he thinks over things as a business partner; that is to say, he is a companion who will go and do battle together with his Master, and because of that, it is improbable for David to betray them. At any rate, they share a common destiny. Since the profits and losses of his Master will result in profits and losses for himself, it is highly unlikely that David will betray them.

### Dialogue Examples

“Archer, David. Yeah, I’ll do it. Definitely will do it.”
“Yo, it’s the day you were born. Let me bless you. By the way, you’re not interested in such things like stocks or land, are you?”
“Good grief; look, that’s uneconomic.”
“The Holy Grail, huuh? Oh, no thank you. Since I already have that sort of thing, right?”
“Abishag! You’re not Abishag?!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

An Israelite King who appears in the Old Testament. Originally a shepherd, David nominated himself and gave out his name for the one-on-one duel with the giant Goliath, before he defeated him. Afterwards, although there were some quarrels with the king at that time, after being enthroned as a splendid king, it has been said that he carried out a magnificent regime.

David was a shepherd as well as a harpist. In those days, in order to play the harp to the King of Israel, who was going to war with the Philistines, David was often visiting the army. Sometime during that period, the Philistine giant Goliath demanded for a single combat that wagered everything on the line.

Made uneasy from the giant’s excessive strength, no one from the Israelite army was able to face him, but only David responded to that one-on-one duel. Although Goliath looked down on David, who challenged him without even taking a sword with him, David threw a stone that made Goliath faint and decapitated his head with the giant’s own sword.

### Connections with Characters

#### Solomon

“Say, he’s doing drastic work. Huh, perhaps there was a matter he can’t be greatly patient with. Me? Look, I’m of the impression that… suppose I ran away with all of my ten treasured mistresses back then, I might completely open up the Ark of the Covenant as I do so. Whether I like it or not, I wooonder if I can really do that sort of thing to Solomon… Hey, instead of talking about the nerve I have and such, I think that guy doesn’t have that sort of freedom? I became a king from being a shepherd, although looking at that guy, can I conclude that he was meant to be a great king since the beginning?”

#### Moses

“Thank you thank you, great ancestor. I truly thank you. But I wonder, isn’t THAT a little too dangerous?”

#### Female Servants in General (With the Exception of Children)

“Abishag! You’re not Abishag?!”
