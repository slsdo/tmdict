### Magical Resistance: A

Nullifies spells that are Rank A or below. Modern mages would not be able to wound David with magecraft.

### Independent Action: A

One is able to act even with the absence of their Master. However, in a situation where one uses an enormous amount of magical energy, backup from their Master becomes necessary.

### Divinity: D

Has a weak Divinity as an ancestor of the Messiah. Approximately of the same rank as Joseph of Nazareth’s. David himself was no more than a mere shepherd in life. However, it seems he possesses some resistance as he is now against Noble Phantasms that are supported by the influence of the Messiah Himself (though not by God’s influence). For instance, “Holy Shrouds”, “Holy Nails”, the “Holy Lance”, and possibly the “Holy Grail”.
