I thought that, since the size of his body is large, wouldn’t it look great if the parts had small changes, so I adjusted him so as to change the impression based on the color change. I drew the raging hair{{n1}} of the third stage to give the feeling of making the strong Lü Bu go even further beyond{{n2}}! A Super Saiyan! It was so much fun. (Wada Arco)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} 怒髪, as in 怒髪天, which means ‘gale’. It seems there’s no proper translation except for ‘angry hair’? Someone give me a hand here.
2. {{note2}} Actually, it just says “even stronger”, but DBZ jokes.
