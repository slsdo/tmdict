God Force.
The True Name of the Houtengageki that Lü Bu was said to use.
A weapon of mass destruction that is a multiple weapon with six forms: Slash{{n1}}, Thrust, Blow, Mow, Sweep, and Shoot.
An artificial Noble Phantasm devised by the super-strategist Chen Gong, since the ancient Chinese god of war, Chi You, had different weapons in his six arms (at this point there were five forms excepting Cannon).
However, its variety has been lost due to the influence of becoming a Berserker, and only the forms (Forces) of Lance (Thrust) and Cannon (Shoot) remain.
In addition, it’s an all-purpose Noble Phantasm that makes use of all the characteristics of large two-handed weapons, but the Houtengageki is in fact a weapon of the Northern Song Dynasty era, and didn’t exist by the time Lü Bu was active.
Indeed, it’s the strongest armament born from 4,000 years of Chinese romance.
