### Bloodsucking: A

One of Vlad’s vampiric abilities. He can turn others into slaves by sucking their blood.

The one who has their blood sucked enters a state of living in death, and usually obeys whoever sucked their blood.

Also, since this counts not as an attack but rather a show of affection, it cannot be defended against even if you were to posses ‘a body which rejects all attacks’.

### Shapeshifting: C

One of Vlad’s vampiric abilities. He can transform into mist, or countless bats.

It’s extremely useful while fighting at melee range, but not so much against attacks which cover a wide area.

### Battle Continuation: A

One of Vlad’s vampiric abilities. He does not know when to give up.

Can fight even after sustaining fatal wounds, his performance receiving no penalty regardless of the state of his body.
