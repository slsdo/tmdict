### Personality

Since he used to be ruler, he has somewhat of a stern attitude, and this hasn’t changed much even after becoming a Berserker. Even as a vampire, he hates the concept of vampires and his wish for the grail is to eliminate the legend of Dracula that has tarnished his name.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Since he was a ruler akin to a tyrant, he has somewhat of a haughty attitude.

He treats his master as one of his retainers. On the other hand, if one is faithful to him, he gets pretty roused up trying to respond to your loyalty.

### Dialogue Examples

“Let the blood of thousands flow, and offer it to me.”

“Very well, girl. If that’s what you wish, I can teach you later. Now, an embroided patch of prayers from their lord would sure fit Master’s clothes, right?”

“You there, do you wish to live eternally at my side? Eternity is quite boring, you see. But if someone like you were at my side, I wouldn’t have to be bored anymore.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Vlad is one of the greatest heroes of Romania, his most famous deed being repelling Mehmed II. Even Mehmed II, who had used tactics such as moving ships through land and had overthrown the Byzantine empire, couldn’t stand up against the demon who put up impaled enemy soldiers for show.

Then he became known as a hero in western europe, and as the embodiment of evil in western europe.

Vlad could have disappeared in history as just the hero of a small country, with him not gaining global fame, but since he was used as the model for Bram Stoker’s ‘Dracula’, his fame suddenly exploded.

But he was not famous as the hero who defeated Mehmed II, but rather he became famous as the vampire of calamity that appeared in ‘Dracula’, Count Dracula.

Furthermore, when being summoned as a Berserker and not as a Lancer, Vlad is summoned as a vampire, not as a hero. That is his current state. He is a monster that sucks blood, transforms into mist and bats, and destroys his enemies with stakes made inside his body.

It seems embroidery was one of his hobbies in life, and even as a Berserker he retains this skill. Apparently he uses this to make stuff for fun in his free time. Thanks to his Mad Enhancement, he has accepted his state as a vampire, but his wish for the grail to eliminate his fame as a vampire remains the same.

He doesn’t mind being feared nor hated. He fought for his authority, for his people, and impaled soldiers to drive off enemies.

A strict rule, merciless judgements, it would be normal for him to be accused of those things, but Vlad couldn’t stand being despised as a monster he has no memory of, and his own self being forgotten in its shadow.

No matter how many times he is defeated in a Holy Grail War, he will not give up.

While his body burns with rage against ignorance, he will not stop fighting until he comes across the one who recognizes him as a hero.

### Connections with Characters

#### Carmilla

As another person who has also been recognized as a vampire, he feels pity seeing her proactively proclaim herself as one.

#### Elizabeth

Contrary to Carmilla, Liz rejects her future while treasuring her past, which Vlad finds charming. Also what’s an idol?
