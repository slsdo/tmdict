Kazikli Bey. A noble phantasm that carries a different effect when used in other classes.

Vlad lets out stakes formed inside the body. Other than wood, the stakes can also be made of bone, flesh, blood, hair, shadows, etc. It is also possible to attract objects within range and turn them into stakes.

The original nature of this noble phantasm is Anti-Army and its based on the legend of the impaled army found by Mehmed II. In this case, the range of the noble phantasm is extremely wide, and is capable of creating and manipulating countless stakes.

This noble phantasm doesnâ€™t reach that level, but is still powerful enough to annihilate a single Servant.

Legend of Dracula. Allows Vlad to transform into the vampire Dracula from the tales spread after his death.

By transforming into Dracula, Vlad loses his other Noble Phantasms and Skills, but gains an enourmous boost to his physical abilities, the ability to transform into mist and animals, self-healing, and charming mystic eyes. However he also gains weaknesses to sunlight and holiness.

This Noble Phantasm is always in effect when Vlad is summoned as a Berserker, so its name is never called out in Fate/GO.
