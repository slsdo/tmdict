Since it’s Vlad, given he had the image of the Impaler Count and Dracula, he was designed so as to be not only scary but also dignified and refined. Since at first it was a design with a high 3D usage for the head and body, I thought about if the cloth moving would look cool. After that, I dared to want to put in a kimono/turtleneck/skirt, and intended to try if a spine pattern in the coat would be well accepted when making the 3D character as well, but I was trying to add nuances resembling the faces of people suffering or Rorschach patterns{{n1}}. Since Vlad’s original image was an image with many curvilineal patterns, I included a design with a larger portion of rectilineal elements and Asian nuances in order not to get too much into that atmosphere.
