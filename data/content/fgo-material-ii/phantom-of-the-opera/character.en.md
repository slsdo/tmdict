### Personality

Fundamentally, the Phantom is gentlemanly. However, he is not a true gentleman; rather, he is doing no more than consistently playing the part of “himself as a gentleman”. An enormous sorrow and anger are being hidden beneath his mask, and he is deeply conscious that once they start to overflow, a tragedy will be brought forth.

The Phantom constantly works to restrain himself and kill those impulses. While holding conversations, he openly sings to show that his suppression of those impulses is being effective. But if he stops singing, evidence of his real nature as the “Phantom of the Opera” – a figure who will become a slaughterer if it is for the sake of his purpose and someone who is cruel and insane enough to deal with the obstacles in his path by elimating them – will begin to appear.

The Phantom likes girls with a beautiful voice. At such a girl where his eyes are affixed to her, he will also appeal that “She will mature into a diva if she is under my guidance.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As for his Master, the Phantom somehow becomes emotionally attached to them while saying “What a magnificently beautiful voice.” He is mixing them up with the diva from his past. Although he acquired an insanity because of his Mental Pollution, he is very obedient as a Servant. However, because his utterances are conversations that are constantly similar to him singing, what he is trying to say is substantially not transmitted very well.

The wish the Phantom wants to make on the Holy Grail is “for the diva that he guided to receive the honour of being the best in the world.” If possible, he wants to bring up his Master as a diva (regardless of their gender). Therefore, he will probably care for his Master more than anything else.

### Dialogue Examples

“I will sing to you as you doze off… with beauty enshrouding you.”
“Sing with me… one more time.”
“It turns out that those who witness my face… will certainly come to know fear… Even you… You too… And you as well!”
“My soul and voice… are here… bundled up into one.”
“…… Sing. Sing. My angel. Sing loudly, to the extent that it can reach even me, who had fallen!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A masked killer. A man who conceals his accursed and grotesque face with a mask modelled after a skull. The mysterious person who appeared in “The Phantom of the Opera”, a novel set in the 19th Century――――Perhaps, the person who became the model of the novel character. Settling down in an aqueduct that is like a vast underground labyrinth beneath the opera house (Palais Garnier), the Phantom was charmed by a pure, chaste and young actress – even guiding her into becoming a diva, and he conducted serial murders on behalf of his unfulfilled love.
