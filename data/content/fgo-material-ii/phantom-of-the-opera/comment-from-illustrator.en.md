Although he already turned into a joke character because of an event from the FGO Story, his design was initially drawn up with an elegant image. However, after Mr. Takeuchi said “He should be even more like a mysterious person”, he settled down into this current design. Also, when I was looking up various mediums of “The Phantom of the Opera” to get that touch in drawing his pictures, I found out that the “Phantom of the Opera” in the olden days was conscious of himself, given that there was a side to this mysterious person who was conscious of his entire face, so it is different when the visuals show him concealing only the right side of his face with a mask; personally, I resolutely created “a mysterious person who is possessing a young man”, and I did an illustration to represent that in his final Ascension. In this game, because he holds a Noble Phantasm that is overall valuable as an Assassin, I am grateful that he greatly plays an active role in the Ember Gatherings. (Shimaudon)
