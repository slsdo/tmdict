An ominous and gigantic musical instrument that is much like a pipe-organ, constructed by combining some of his former victims’ corpses. Maybe the sinful deeds that Ryuunosuke Uryuu attempted through trial and error had already been completed in the 19th Century————or maybe, this is the image of the cruel and mysterious person at the time of his materialization, sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.

By matching it with his singing voice that is owned by his grotesque vocal organs, this Noble Phantasm scatters invisible magic damage to the surroundings. For the Phantom himself, who is the performer, he does not take any damage from the attack. Because it is an attack done not through sound, but purely through a radiation of magical energy, it is possible to block it with defensive magic and abilities. Equipped armour and the like also works effectively.
