I had told myself that I’m fine, I have the previous design after all, but then later on it was such an immense pressure. The third stage’s golden makes my heart all fluttering and scratching; no, to put it simply, I have shown the chink in my armor towards the goddess at the very end! Is what the result of the raging battle within my heart. (Again, be it due to the opening that I’ve shown or just naturally happens, I really think this goddess is beautiful.) THe shape of the base design’s heel sandal really, really makes my heart throb, so I really didn’t hesitate over it. (AKIRA)
