Smile of the Stheno.
The charm of the goddess, capable of turning heroes into captives by a single blow, taking form as a Noble Phantasm.
Be it a powerful war veteran or a gentleman filled with integrity, as long as he is a male he will immediately die (fall). The strongest of whispers, filled with words of love.
The languorous gaze is her blade, the alluring whispers her poison.
And after that is the killing blow-----a bewitching adorable pose that drops all pretenses. And the perfect finisher, a heart shape with her finger!
Most men would fall over it, yet when one manages to endure it, she would get quite vexed. (Just vexed. Thatâ€™s it.)
