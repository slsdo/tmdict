### True Name Discernment: B

When summoned as a Ruler, a Servant’s True Name as well as their entire status information are automatically revealed to them during a direct encounter. However, in regards to Servants who possess concealment abilities, a success of a Luck Check becomes a requirement to bypass those abilities.

### Divine Ruling: A

The supreme privilege of a Ruler. One can exercise two Command Spells for each Servant participating in a “Holy Grail War”. It is not possible to divert other Command Spells that were used on a Servant for another use.

### Revelation: A

A Skill equivalent to “Intuition”. Although Intuition is a sixth sense regarding combat, “Revelation” accommodates all events related to the accomplishment of an objective (for instance, choosing the most suitable route while in the middle of travelling). Because there is no basis to it (or so it seems to the person themselves), it cannot be explained well to others.

### Charisma: C

The natural talent to command an army.

Jeanne’s figure where she participated in assaults while raising a flag overhead on the battlefield has been turned into something that boosts the soldiers’ morale to the utmost limit and unites the troops. Thanks to her Charisma, she can make others believe in the contents of her baseless “Revelations”.

### Saint: B

Signifies one who is acknowledged as a Saint. At the moment of being summoned as a Servant, the ability of Saint is selected from one out of the following: “raises the effectiveness of sacraments”, “automatic HP recovery”, “1 rank-up to Charisma”, “production of holy shrouds is possible”.
