Jeanne d’Arc’s design was created at the time of Fate Online, which became the predecessor to FateGO. At that time, she was being considered as a character who feels like she forms a pair with Artoria, and if Artoria is treated as a girl knight, then Jeanne was consciously designed so that she becomes an older female knight in comparison to Artoria. For her third stage in FateGO, I collected all of my focus on the concept of a “holy maiden” that was left out at the time of her design, so concerning the result, I am thinking, ‘I wonder if I successfully brought out that characteristic into prominence.’ (Takeuchi Takashi)
