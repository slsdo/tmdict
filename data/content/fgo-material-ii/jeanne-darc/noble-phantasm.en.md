### Luminosité Eternelle: My God is Here with Me

The holy flag Jeanne waved during her lifetime that became a Noble Phantasm. This flag is an article that, upon activation, serves as the center of an area with a range of 10, protecting those inside according to an angel’s blessing. It is feasible to use Jeanne’s Magical Resistance, which is considered outside the standard (EX), as it is as a physical defense ability. However, it will become absolutely impossible for Jeanne to attack during the period where she is establishing the flag. Also, because the flag itself continues to accumulate damage as it defends against attacks, it will become an unusable article if abused too much.

A holy sword that makes flames manifest by invoking the following line from a death poem: “O’ Lord, I entrust this body to You————”. A Conceptual Crystallized Armament that interpreted Jeanne’s burning at the stake like it is an attack. It is a subcategory of a Reality Marble, an imagined landscape crystallized as a sword. This sword is the Heroic Spirit Jeanne d’Arc herself, and after the battle where this Noble Phantasm was manifested, Jeanne will be extinguished.
