### Personality

A complete sadist who is swayed by sadism. All enemies that catch Caligula’s eyes will become targets of tyranny and wickedness. (With the disposition of a Servant, he will not bare his fangs on his own faction, basically.) Furthermore, because he fell into a state in which his self-restraint is ineffective due to the Madness Enhancement Skill, he is unmanageable. Even if he speaks the language, given that it is something like a beast’s roar, coming to a mutual understanding is impossible. But, even in such a state, he likes Rome. He also likes Nero.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Caligula is thought to be regarding the Protagonist as a Roman citizen. Because he likes Roman citizens, naturally, he likes the Protagonist too. Still, since he lost his reason as he is now, as expected, he cannot come to a mutual understanding with them. Though one can understand to a degree that he is probably not loathing them.

The wish Caligula wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to get rid of his insanity.” If it is possible for it to come true, he wants to return————to that time where he was once called a wise ruler, to that time when he was reading stories to the beloved child of his younger sister, Nero, who was sitting on his lap————a time from even before that moment when the Moon Goddess fell in love with him and overflowed his body with madness.

### Dialogue Examples

“My, conduct, is, in, my destiny.”
“Offer me, that, life!”
“Offer me, that, body!”
“Beautiful, ooh so… beautiful… I want to steal it, I want to indulge in it, I want to tear it up, and I want to excessively violate, with my whole body, all of the beauty that has become your purity, as if that purity was of a goddess’s! I, love, you, the child of my dear younger sister, Nero!”
“▂▂▃▃▅▅————!!”

※Although he can pretty much enter into a conversation of words, given that it is something like a beast’s roar, coming to a mutual understanding with him is impossible.

### Historical Image · Character Image

The Third Emperor of ancient Rome who possesses a legend of tyranny. A figure of the 1st Century. The uncle of Emperor Nero. At one time, Caligula vigorously stimulated government affairs, and it is said that he had received a lot of support from the people as a wise ruler.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

At a certain time, Caligula’s mental state had transformed. Without waiting for deification by the ancient Roman statesmen that one would succeed in acquiring after death, he forced the people, with his tyranny and dissipation, to call himself a god while he was still living, having exhausted his wickedness and perversion to their limits. The people of Rome violently trembled from the sudden change of the emperor, and unanimously whispered: “The wise ruler had already disappeared, and now, Emperor Gaius – Caligula, has fallen into madness.” The reign of the young emperor who had gone insane did not last long. He was assassinated, struck by the blade of rebellion from the many people who chose to center their influence around powers such as the Senate. That reign was only four years. However, that name was deeply left behind in the people’s memories as numerous acts of atrocities.

According to the values of ancient Rome at that time, it is said that his insanity was namely considered as “being loved by the moon.” That is————Caligula had received the affection of the Moon Goddess.

While he is an existence close to an anti-hero, the reason why Caligula materialized as a Heroic Spirit is unknown. Perhaps the reason was really a prank from a Divine Spirit who governs over the moon, or maybe, the reason secretly exists in his insanity, where perhaps his spirit from around the time when he was once called a wise ruler was encouraged once again when the demise of human history was laid before him————

### Connections with Characters

#### Nero

The beloved child of his younger sister. His niece. Loves her. She is a blood relative of his, while simultaneously, Nero, being the emperor who took over the next era of Rome back then, is a subject who Caligula ought to love.

### Caesar

The great ancestor. An ally that should also be called the genuine first emperor. Caesar, who realized the foundation of Imperial Rome by accomplishing the Roman Republic’s subjugation, is a subject who Caligula ought to love.

### Romulus

The exalted Divine Founder above all else. The whole Roman world began through his way. Being truly the child of the God of War Mars, even though the likes of “Roman emperors were deified after death” already, they cannot even reach this person’s feet.

### Altera

Caligula feels an unpleasant presence…
