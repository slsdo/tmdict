The Third Emperor of the Roman Empire… he is the uncle who loves Nero. If I remember correctly, I think he is the character I designed first in the beginning. ‘At any rate, he appears Roman!‘ I tried to make that impression become clear. Given that I was drawing while looking with a sidelong glance at Miss Wada’s Nero, he does not feel out of place that much even if they are put side-by-side… I think. Berserkers; there are many cool characters that fully come out with an aura, or more precisely, flashiness, to them, but it is disappointing because it is common for them with their circumstances to not hold conversations, so their personalities come out a little bit weak.
