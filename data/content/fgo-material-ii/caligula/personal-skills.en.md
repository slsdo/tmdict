### Imperial Privilege: A

Skills that essentially cannot be possessed by oneself can be acquired for a short time. The relevant Skills this covers are Riding, swordsmanship, fine arts, Charisma, Military Tactics, and many others. Because this is not lower than Rank A, those that are a burden to the body (such as Divinity) can even be acquired.

### Sadistic Constitution: A

Applies a plus modifier to oneâ€™s aggression in battle. Their sadistic nature will continue to grow to some degree should the battle drag on.

As it is close in nature to the Madness Enhancement Skill, Caligula cannot demonstrate this Skill to the fullest.

### Glory of the Olden Days: B

The memories of the four-year period when Caligula lived as a wise king do not soften his insanity, but rather accelerates it. Applies a plus modifier to his resistance checks against mental interferences and temporarily raises his Strength parameter when attacking bare-handed, but every time Caligula uses this effect, he personally takes damage. His rampaging insanity makes his Spiritual Core grate.
