### Madness Enhancement: A+

Rank up for all parameters, but snatches away most of one’s reason.

Since only his sense of duty where he must expand more of the Roman Empire and make it prosper is not lost, in the situation where one seeks to make contact with him by revealing a reference to Rome to take sides with him, a Luck Check is conducted, and he restrains his rampage if the check is successful. If the contact happens from a figure who is related to Rome, a plus modifier is appended to the check. That is to say, if Nero or Romulus approaches him, to start with, he will reliably succeed in restraining himself. However, given that the matter of being restrained is just him “changing into a standby status instead of rampaging around”, one can conclude that coming to a complete mutual understanding with him does not prove to be feasible.
