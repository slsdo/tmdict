A wide range Mental Pollution attack that diffuses his own insanity through the moonlight projected through the sky. The manifestation of his insanity was something due to the affection and divine protection of the Moon Goddess Diana (who is equivalent to Artemis of the Twelve Olympians)————This Noble Phantasm sublimated that legend. If employed on an opposing army for instance, a situation that is repulsive and even tragic would probably be born. Its primary usage requirement is “for the circumstances to be at night.” This Noble Phantasm’s effects do not apply to those that are related to the goddess Artemis{{n1}}.
