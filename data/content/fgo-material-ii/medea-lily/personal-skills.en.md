### High-Speed Divine Words: A

Allows to perform magecraft without a summoning/activating the Magic Circuits.
Can launch even High-Thaumaturgy in one stage (Single Action).


### Poison Resistance: A

The excellent healing mage, Medea, can naturally invalidate any poison.
At the same time she heals the surrounding’s poison, she recovers stamina.

### Romance of Foam: B

That was a fragile love like a bubble, wasn’t it?
The whispered intimacies were hollow words, weren’t they?
But, what’s wrong with that?
Even if those whispers weren’t true, even if everything was a lie,
until the burst with a needle prick ――― certainly, it’s love.
