Pain Breaker.
A healing Noble Phantasm that is paired up with the 『All talismans must be destroyed (Rule Breaker)』 that the original Caster Medea uses. If Medea’s Noble Phantasm is an embodiment of the legend of betrayal, Medea Lily’s Noble Phantasm could be said to be an embodiment of love.
Any curse and injury will be returned to zero through magecraft. It’s not time manipulation, but auto-repairing by calculating the appearance that should be, but for those who don’t know it’ll look like time rewinding.
Any unreasonableness except for “death” can be overcome, but the dead alone can’t be recovered.
