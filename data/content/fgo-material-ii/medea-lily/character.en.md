### Personality

A young lady separated from the world of grief and worry. She has been summoned in the form just before being ensnared by Jason, her loveliness will not allow others to come level with her.
Since she’s seriously aware of not knowing about the world, there’s a mixture of feelings of wanting to do something and resignation for being helpless.
On the other hand, she understands her own gruesome ending.
Good-natured and easy to trust people in her innocence ――― If turned the other way, that also means that she’s full of distrust towards humans.
It’s not that she trusts, but that she wants to trust.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The fundamentally good Medea Lily will serve her Master.
Also, since there’s no motive to wager the Holy Grail, basically it will be possible to build a gentle master-servant relationship.
However, she also draws a line like other equal Servant.
Attachment is attachment, but she’ll be in a state of negligence as long as the Master doesn’t give the step.
In the case of a Master that truly cares about her, her likability will rise more and more.

### Dialogue Examples

『…… I don’t like fighting, but I’ll do what I must do!』
『I-I wonder if it’s fine for me to be so blissful……
No, it’s not time to grow timid! In order to end your battle safely, let me do my best, Master!』
『I’ve changed since I met you.
The me that was scared of the outside world isn’t here anymore. Now I will wield this staff for the sake of your advancing future and the world you live in.
…… Thank you, my Master. I’ll pray for being able to stay to your side until the end.』

### Historical Image · Character Image

Medea was the daughter of king Aeëtes, a princess that was taught magecraft by the moon goddess Hecate.
For her at those times, the world was beautiful, and something such as living itself being painful was a faraway and distant event.
A vague presentiment, that she’ll be married to someone that will be necessary for the country in the near future. There was no love or affection, only an obligation as royalty.

――― There wasn’t the knowledge to feel dissatisfaction about that, nor the feeling.

Even if Medea knew that love and affection existed, she didn’t know that they maddened people.
By the wiles of the gods, Medea fell in love with Jason. Her cheeks blushed and her chest throbbed. She thought that this man she had just met was more important than anyone of her family.
It wasn’t something manifested from her own heart ――― however, she was manipulated.
That was her first love for her.
…… If we assume there’s one tragedy.
For Jason, Medea was just a necessary capable person for him to become king but not a partner whom he fell in love with.
That’s why, when Medea killed her younger brother without hesitation for Jason’s sake, he became deeply frightened.
Considering it calmly, everything Medea did was for Jason, but Jason didn’t love Medea enough for him to believe that.

### Scenario in FateGO

She’s fixed on the state of when, after finishing a boat trip, Jason declared “damned witch, I don’t love you”.
A lady sheltered from the world that, while certainly grasping Jason’s circumstances and her own state, she blinks in surprise and tilts her head with a『But why did it turn this way?』 towards her own fate.
Since she still has to experience becoming the Witch of Betrayal, Medea Lily doesn’t know the pain of treason yet.
She’s just a little girl that, in order to not bring shame to the names of her ancestor the goddess Hecate and her teacher the witch Circe, tries to believe in the bonds of people as a good witch.
