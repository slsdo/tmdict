The surprising manifestation of a non-loli ver. I individually drew at first in the materials thinking it was a joke (lol). A parallel different existence from the short-haired Medea in hollow, I’m told. She’s the first one I started drawing individually for the FateGO pictures, so I fumbled with all kind of things.
For some reason I misunderstood that the sprites would be 3D models and raised the small details more than necessary. She was intently designed as lovely, but the way she’s distorted in the work makes a wonderful contrast. (Koyama Hirokazu)
