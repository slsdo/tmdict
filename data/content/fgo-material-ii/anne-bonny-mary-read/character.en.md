### Personality

#### Anne Bonny

… A passionate, beautiful woman. Regarding Mary, Anne loves her dearly as a close friend, family member and younger sister{{n1}}. Although Anne has a character with a daredevil attitude and is well-versed in being able to deal with men skillfully, it is said that a portion of her “core” is heroic, possessing a courage and liveliness that puts men to shame, and is someone who is “not even afraid of death, greeting it with a laugh.”

#### Mary Read

… A young woman who talks with her mouth with a few words and in murmurs. Mary fundamentally has a maidenly character, but because she was raised as a man, she forcibly puts on a strongly masculine and brave front, hiding that feminine “core”. She is a little rebellious against authority and fights with a dauntless courage on the battlefield regardless of her relationship to either gender.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

For both Anne and Mary together, they take into consideration if their Master is of the “same class” as them, and they are fundamentally a little rebellious. Especially even more so if their partner is a person of the bourgeois class. They have no problems with people such as the naïve Shirou or Rin who is neutral towards those with authority, but they feel that what is called the ‘worst compatibility’ is being partnered with someone like Tokiomi for instance.

### Dialogue Examples

Mary: “————Servant Rider. Mary Read. You summoned us, no?… Well, whatever. Best regards.”
Anne: “HEERE. If Mary comes, naturally I’ll also be summoned~ Anne Bonny. If I just have one musket, I’ll show you that I can very much shoot somebody at wherever they may be.”

Mary: “Humph. It’s not a satisfactory matter when one leaves their name in history, don’t you agree? Because of that Master, what will you do about this?”
Anne: “Now, now. It’s also fun to have ourselves enjoy a second life in this way, yeah?”

Mary: “S-Say. I… I wonder if I can do something for you? Alright. Because I, Rider, will follow you and indeed leap out to the ocean for you, no matter how big it is.”
Anne: “Unbelievable, Mary was acting affectionately!?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Mary Read and Anne Bonny are members of the most famous pirates in history, and they are also extremely unique pirates. They were two female pirates on board the pirate ship Calico Jack that was lead by a man named John Rackham.

One person was Anne Bonny. Although she was the daughter of a wealthy person, she eloped with a good-for-nothing man in the end and joined John Rackham’s pirate crew.

And the other person was Mary Read. As she was disguising herself as a man and was in the process of working on a Dutch ship, she was captured by Rackham’s pirate crew and was forced to work as one of their crew members. Although, she was originally raised up as a man by her mother, so it seems that she had fitted in with the nature of the piracy business, having fought boldly together with Anne Bonny whom she personally shared her secret of being a woman to. The two are close friends, comrade-in-arms, whom were linking a powerful bond between them that went beyond passions like romance and love.

It was the same in their last battle as well. When John Rackham’s pirate crew had anchored in Jamaica, they were struck by a raid from privateers (they are ships permitted to snatch away enemy cargos, and it is even possible to say that they are state-authorized pirates). It is said that while John Rackham and his subordinate men became frightened and hid inside their ship’s hatch, Mary Read and Anne Bonny were the only two people that kept on fighting to the very end. A testimony left behind said that one among the two fired her pistol into the ship’s hatch while shouting “Get out and fight like men!”, but in the end, Rackham and the others were arrested without having fought back, and the two female pirates were finally captured too after a fierce battle.

Mary Read died while suffering from a fever inside her jail, but it was said that Anne Bonny turned and escaped due to her father’s moves. When she did so, Anne informed John Rackham with a scornful look in her eyes.

“If you had fought like a man, you need not have been hang’d like a dog.”

… The name of John Rackham remained in pirate history. However, the reason is not because of the bravery and brutalness he himself has, but for being “the shameful coward, the captain of the ship that had on board two rare female pirates named Mary Read and Anne Bonny.”
