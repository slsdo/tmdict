### Sailing: A

Steering techniques for ships. Because these serve as specialized techniques for ships only, one cannot manage horses and chariots with these techniques.

By merely being reputed as pirates, both of them are talented in steering ships.

### Marksmanship: B

General shooting techniques, which include trick shots and quick draws by means of small arms.

For Anne Bonny’s shooting ability, her skills are to the extent that she can hit the mark on what she is aiming at with her musket, even while on board a shaking ship.

### Combination: C

A Skill that displays how much one’s combat power rises in the case of being on a united front with a specific person.

If it is at Rank C, in spite of how severe a battlefield is, a pair can mutually grasp each other’s actions with just a single gaze and then take the most suitable action.

In Mary and Anne’s case, their Noble Phantasm receives a big influence as well from having this Skill.
