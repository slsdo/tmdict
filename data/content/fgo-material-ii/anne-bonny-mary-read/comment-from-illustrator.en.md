Anne’s clothes have a huge admiral clothing article coiling out of her waist, and that forms the silhouette of a dress with a large ribbon attached to it. (Although I do not know who on earth was originally planning to wear that, no matter what kind of size a human being has.) The image of that battle when their various clothes are becoming ragged is at the most extraordinary closing moments. In addition, one can conclude that the burning background is not in accordance with historical fact as it is the result of me having attached an importance of understandability to the background. The rifle seems to be terribly long, but the point is that, for those days, it is not an unusual size even then. Its range is not 100m, so after firing a lead bullet at someone with a bang, it is assumed that the way to use it is by using it as a club with iron covered on both ends.

Mary’s coat, rather than even calling it clothing, is an article similar to a leather armour with the purpose of defending her neck and arms. On the back side of it is a skull painted with white paint. (As a result of reflecting on it, it is not that famous pirate flag when they are summoned as Heroic Spirits, yet what is the significance of her fighting while carrying that flag on her back?)

Regarding the bunny suits, they were not in the orders. Naturally, it has no connection to them, not any at all, even if one assesses it historically (bunny girls were born in the period of the year 1960. Even Anne Bonny, who died in the year 1762, would not be at the level of history where she could receive such a thing in advance). Basically, the reason is that this is my preference. Sorry. Though one should know by now that bunnies are nice, isn’t that right? Just in case, as an excuse, how about I go through with insisting on swimsuits? Hey, when I decided to seriously negotiate about that, there was just about no clothing specifications assigned to me. Just that they are fine with them as long as they look like pirates. But look, considering that, there is already elder sister Drake for a proper female pirate I can refer to. (I-IV)
