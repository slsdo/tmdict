### Personality

A Servant whose attire and appearance truly gives off the impression of a pirate.
A pioneer and adventurer by nature, and a scoundrel with fine character.
A firm hedonist, she treats with no difference those virtous and those wicked. In any case, she is extravagant be it in her private life or in war; a personality that approves of ephemereal pleasure that leaves nothing behind, as if a storm has blown over ever so fiercely. What awaits at the end of all that is a glorious ruin; a death with no attachment to life, or to the meaning as a human being, or to a live full of pride. She loves and approves of that ruin, one that visits everyone equally. She shall pushes on, she will conquer, she will plunder, and she will thrive from it.
That is her creed, one that displays its true value in battle against “even harder challenges” and “those stronger then herself”. She loves her share of gold and silver treasures. However, what she truly loves is not “an everlasting wealth”, but “wealth that would vanish like a fireworks”. A lively big sister, scattering gold coins about with tankard on hand. She prefers expending her wealth more than amassing it; due to that, her personality is incompatible with that of Gilgamesh, who possesses infinite wealth.
She has no complaints being a Servant; taking a stand as an adjutant, she will not feel any dissatisfaction no matter how the Master is. This is due to her time supporting the navy during the age of pirates; she is used to being an adjutant and to incompetent superiors.
In addition, she would without fail claim her employment rewards. As a Servant, her policy is to answer whatever it is that the Master desires; however, she would not “loan out” beyond the Master’s own ability. As a merchant, she is very blunt in that area.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She does not hate people, but nor is she fond of them too. Her sentiment towards those who sways in the balance between good and evil amounts to “including me, we are all a bunch of irredeemable creatures”. Due to that, she is able to look at things while enjoying it even if she is amazed by it.
For that reason, her evaluation standard for people is quite broadminded. She won’t loathe a Master simply “because the Master is evil” or “because the Master is a turncoat”.
If her Master is a scoundrel, her stance is to also enjoy herself as a villain, fooling around at the same time with her philosophy of “since nothing’s gonna be left behind in the end after all” appearing and disappearing.

### Dialogue Examples

“Alright you rascals, it’s time! The Storm King and gathering of ghosts, it’s time to begin the Wild Hunt!”
“Remember my name! Temeroso el Draque; the woman who brought down the sun!”
“Mm? You’re mad, huh? Mad until you’re almost vomiting it seems.
Still, didn’t I already said this when we first made contract, boy?
‘You prepared for this? Be it winning or losing, a villain’s death is laughably miserable’, that is!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A figure that actually exists. A voyager who had lived in England 16th century during the age of exploration.
She is an adventurer and a privateer captain (pirate). With the West India Archipelago as the stage, she had laid waste the Spainard ships and colonies, feared with her alias Temeroso el Draque. (El Draque is Spain for the devil).
Afterwards, she led her fleet with the Golden Hind as her flagship, and had accomplished circumnavigation in the flesh. Her profits had guided England to the summit of the world. With those achievement, she had been awarded a knighthood and been made a vice admiral of the England navy.
There was a also period where she assumed the seat of Mayor of Plymouth, but she then returned to the sea to once again continue fighting Spain as commander of naval fleets, crushing Spain’s invincible armada. She had in reality brought Spain, known as “the empire on which the sun never sets”, to their downfall.
She is a woman in the world of Fate, and there was also a rumour that the reason she had challenged the course of circumnavigation was due to the request of her friend, the queen of England.

### Role within the Game

She had bide her time and made her appearance in the third chapter “Sealed Ends of the Four Seas Okeanos”. She had the dignity befitting of monarch of the sea, surprising the protagonists as she had already obtained a Holy Grail when their arrive. Such was the surprising development that awaits. For the enemy that appeared in this chapter, “Blackbeard” Edward Teach (who had been active roughly a century after her), she is an admirable existence as well; from his mouth too was the greatness{{n1}} of Francis Drake emphasized.
Fascinating both friend or foe, she and her voyage had given great influence to the protagonists and friends who continues their travel through time.

### Role in Past Works

She makes an appearance in Fate/EXTRA. With Shinji as the Master, she accepts him as a villain while also acting and stipulating herself as a villain as well. She displays her true value in the battle against “even harder challenges” and “those stronger then herself”, but unfortunately her role in the Holy Grail War of the Moon is to be the opponent of the protagonist, who had yet to remember anything and yet to recognize himself.
