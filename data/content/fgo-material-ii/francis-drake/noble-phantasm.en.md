Golden Wild Hunt.
With Rider’s beloved ship from her previous life, the Golden Hind, as its core, an expanding innummerable ghost fleets that Rider once commanded when alive are summoned. They annihilate the enemy with the simultaneous bombardment of overwhelming firepower. It is Rider’s trumpcard, a Noble Phantasm that can also be said to be the manifestation of her everyday life.
Its rank as an anti-army Noble Phantasm is also high, but it possesses the uncommon special characteristic where its power fluctuates depending on how much wealth she possesses at the moment.
Its maximum deployment includes fireships, an attack that tramples down everything on the surface of the ocean that lays before it. However, for the Captain Drake who has been summoned as a Servant, one can think of it as a one time only decisive move.
