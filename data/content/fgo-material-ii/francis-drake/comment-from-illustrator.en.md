Drake has a different face type compared to the other girls, so I had fun drawing her. I had thought that the character itself had too much things scattered about on her, but because I filled it up with pirate-ish coverings, it passed with no objection. After that, I’m satisifed because I get to draw in some extreme reflection on her breast!!!!! My friend has her, so occasionally I borrow from her, and I’m so jealous that she gets to produce of so much stars. I also want some… I’ve tried my best to aim for her, but it’s no good in the end~ Aahh~ (Wada Arco)
