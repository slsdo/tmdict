Although I made a design that placed an emphasis on her thigh which daringly reveals her legs as she has an anecdote where her thigh was slashed by Shi Huangdi, due to the battle scenes, I happen to get the feeling that she seems terribly cold in the snowy mountains and the like, so I felt a little pitiful for her as a result. There is a mask she owns with a sense of respect as I feel like if one says the word ‘Assassin’, I think of a mask, but I got instructions saying “Do not put it on her face, alright?” On her battle sprite, it was cute to give her a pat on the head.
