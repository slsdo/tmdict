The dagger prepared for the assassination of Shi Huangdi. According to an anecdote, it was said to be enveloped and hidden within a map scroll, so it extraordinarily excels in the aspect of concealment. The poison on the blade can even cause instant death with just about a scratch, but those who have anecdotes of being poison-proof will carry out an advantageous check against it.

However, such an aspect is not the true value of this Noble Phantasm. Using this dagger is something that shows the resolution of “one who is never to return from their mission.” Therefore, Jing Ke accepts her death when using this Noble Phantasm, choosing to use all her strength to carry out the assassination. Based on the matter of executing the mission on the premise of one who is never to return from their mission, it is an assassination Noble Phantasm that is extremely difficult to avoid.
