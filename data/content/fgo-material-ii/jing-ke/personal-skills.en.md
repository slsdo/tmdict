### Suppression: A

An assassin’s secret art that will absolutely not let one’s bloodlust come out to the surface until the moment just before the attack. If it at least reaches Rank A, others would be unable to surmise the presence of one’s bloodlust until the instant they grasp a weapon in their hand.

### Planning: B

Tactical thinking done up to assassinating a target. Unlike Military Tactics, this is constricted to only assassination missions in which few people are involved.

Furthermore, having herself return alive is not taken into account.

### As If No One Is Nearby: A

The creator of this idiom, which is generally still used even in the present.
