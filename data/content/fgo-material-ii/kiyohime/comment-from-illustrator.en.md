The originator of the yandere that fell in love with Anchin but burned him to death for deceiving her. The Kiyohee that everyone loves. Since the game character of Kiyohime already is here and there with black hair and Japanese clothing, I thought about trying to make her completely different, and tried a more Western design covered with a yandere atmosphere. At the beginning there were lots of design ideas in which she was dressed with something like a jūnihitoe, but I told the boss about opening fully the thighs after drawing while balancing the numbers and it resulted in the current shape. Actually, when I listened to one battle voice that has been stored, I thought it was definitely charming but it was helplessly put on hold, but… At that time I thought that was awful but thinking about it now I feel there wasn’t any problem (lol) (BLACK)
