### Shapeshift: C

Borrowing bodies and molding them. She was reduced to a venomous snake by a woman’s determination, and crossed a large river.
Can transform into a low grade Oriental dragon. She’ll run with all her heart as long as she has legs, but when her legs disappear, she’ll start crawling around on the ground. She will also exhale flames. What’s going on?

### Stalking: B

A skill to continue pursuing the beloved target.
With something that includes the five senses and mana, and that should rather be called a wild instinct, she chases after Anchin everywhere.

### Flame-Colored Kiss: A

What Kiyohime seeks from her Master. If their lips lock once, she’ll get rid of any hindrance, and will be willing to turn into Super Kiyohime-chan.
As a compensation, the definition of the Master’s future (groom) will be seized, but it’s a trivial risk.
