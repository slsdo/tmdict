### Personality

Basically so calm that she’s dyed in madness, she can converse so flawlessly that most humans wouldn’t think of her as a Berserker.
However, she’s not interested in the whole world, and only recognizes that it’d be good if there were only 「her」 and 「Master」.
Also, her biggest concern is 「whether Master loves her or not」, and she’ll forgive with a laugh being popular enough to have a harem, but if they enter a specific route with someone that isn’t Kiyohime, she’ll aggressively stare with empty eyes, really scary.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Of course, she’ll treat them with ardent affection.
Gently waking them up in the morning, staying at their side at noon, and diving in the futon and gently whispering 「Good night」at nighttime, she’s a devoted Servant, ri-ght?

### Dialogue Examples

「Servant, Berserker. Thank you very much for having summoned me. Ah…… I finally found you. Dear……」

「Thank you very much. It’s fine, my Mad Enhancement skill is not an important thing. Thank you for your concern」

「―――― Lies, right? That isn’t good, Master. It’s true that she’s more cheerful and lively than me, and she matches Master’s tastes. But, you certainly said you loved me. Unless you disprove it, that love is a distorted ostentation. I shall take one Command Spell. Next time, please use it yourself. Otherwise ――――」

「My trigger is lies. When I’m lied to, my own heart boils irremediably. That’s why, I love you, Master. Please, may you not lie」

「―――― You are a liar, right?」

——— Liar, liar, liar.

The beautiful heroine (yandere) that appears in 「The Legend of Anchin and Kiyohime」. That’s Kiyohime.

While the beautiful monk Anchin proceeded to the main Kumano shrines, he sought the inn of the elder of the Masago, Kiyotsugu to spend the night. The daughter of Kiyotsugu, Kiyohime, had her heart trembling for Anchin’s beauty, and sneakingly visited him at night.

——— You and me, are tied by fate.

Although Anchin, whose body was to serve Buddha, rejected Kiyohime, Kiyohime stubbornly didn’t acknowledge it. He, who was at a loss, promised to stop by when he returned from visiting the Kumano shrines.

——— Weren’t you the one who promised to reunite?

However, Anchin broke his promise with Kiyohime and traveled without stopping by Kiyohime’s place.
Kiyohime, who knew this, truly took the form of an oni, and began the chasing of Anchin.

——— If you didn’t love me, it was fine to say you didn’t love me.
——— It would have been fine not to leave any regrets.
——— It would have been fine if you rather killed me.

Anchin was horrified at the hateful her that kept glaring at him, and ran away to escape.
The girl that shouldn’t be able to chase a good walker priest, kept pursuing him through tenacity alone.
Resentment, grudge, bitterness ——— The accumulated emotions soon changed Kiyohime into a bizarre appearance.
In order to tenaciously chase him, she grew a tail and her legs disappeared as she lost her human form.
Although Anchin somehow reached Dōjōji and fled into the bell, Kiyohime, who had turned into a giant dragon, spit out flames and pressed hard against the bell with her entire body, and burned Anchin to death.
But Kiyohime, who burned him, without being able to return to be a person like that or to reign as a Phantasmal, committed suicide by drowning while shedding tears.
Anchin was unaware of being loved until the end.
Kiyohime couldn’t understand her violent feelings until the end.

——— Aah. Why didn’t my love go well?

It is also said that the couple, who were held a service by the priests of the temple, became tennin.{{n2}}

### Connections with Characters

#### Elizabeth

Lacertid, beaded lizard, Komodo dragon, and countless other insults.

#### Tamamo no Mae

E-pal. I often suggest her to meet offline, but for some reason she has something to do and it doesn’t go well. For both, the advises that often consult each other about were off the mark.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} This seems to be a fragment of the original legend. I couldn’t find any good translation, so I tried to do it on my own.
2. {{note2}} Tennin = Celestial person. The official translation is vague, so I transcribed it literally like with “oni” to avoid You’s rage.
