Tenshin Kashō Zanmai.
A serpent that spits flames. In other words, transformation into a dragon.
Each turn, either a constricting or a fiery attack is performed.
The constriction is a direct and single-target attack.
The flames are a ranged mass attack with a maximum range of 10.
Still, it’s not as if she inherited blood from the Dragon Kind.
What is here is just a persistent, firm conviction on the man that lied to her.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Samadhi is a state of mind in which you’re super-concentrated on something. 三昧 (Zanmai) also refers to "being immersed/absorbed in sth". Quite fitting for a yandere.
