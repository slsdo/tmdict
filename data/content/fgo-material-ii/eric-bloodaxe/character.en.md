### Personality

The distinction between friend and foe is barely being established, and some intelligence exists, but that is just all there is. Towards the enemies in addition, Eric hastily charges at them. However, there are extremely rare situations where he regains his sanity. Sometime during that period, it becomes possible to even converse with him according to an intermediation done through Gunnhild.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Eric has absolutely no cunning intentions and the like. He is something like a beast of prey, only trying to slaughter his enemies. He also has particularly no pickiness regarding whoever his Master is, coming to a clean decision about that matter. However, it is different with his wife Gunnhild. She will come to address the Master through Eric when her husband is summoned, utilizing some kind of method to do so. Gunnhild always transmits a complaint about how she is not tolerant of the fact that Eric was summoned just to be used, not to mention that it is an insult that he was summoned as a Berserker, and so forth. A monster wife so to speak.

### Dialogue Examples

“GR, GRRRr, GRRRRRRRRRRR!”
“… I am just now manipulating these words by getting help from my wife. Stop the ruin of the world. If it is for that objective————gr, ngh. NOISE, gr,”
“… Okay, there is a chance again. In short, what I want to say is this. I am thankful that you summoned me and are making use of me. End of transmission. Sorry, Gunnhild.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Eric the Bloodaxe King. He is a king who ruled over Norway around the 10th Century. However, he only reigned over a period that did not even fulfill three years, and after that reign, he escaped to England and was installed as a mere feudal lord of a rural area.

Nevertheless, Eric slaughtered his many brothers for the Norwegian throne during those three years. Even though his nickname, the Bloodaxe King, has no elegance, and even if his brothers shared the same blood, his tyranny would not come to a stop. And in the shadows, it is said that the one operating behind those scenes was the “witch” Gunnhild, who married Eric. Gunnhild was a staunch female mage, but at the same time, she appears to have deeply loved her husband Eric, and after Eric’s death, Gunnhild composed poetry on behalf of giving praise to him. According to those, Eric is the sixth king on the throne who came after the hero of Scandinavia, Sigmund, and he is said to be welcomed as a great warrior by the Great God Odin… Well, that love for Eric continues even now whenever Eric is summoned, a complaint from Gunnhild suddenly being delivered to the summoner through witchcraft and out of nowhere.

### Connections with Characters

Does not have any (because Gunnhild is scary).
