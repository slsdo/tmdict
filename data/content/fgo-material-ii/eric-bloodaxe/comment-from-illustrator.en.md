At the time when I became responsible for him, I thought, “But I had hardly drawn any male characters at all until this person…”, and I was fairly flustered deep down. It seems they said he smacks of a man… so I searched for images… and decided on giving him a happy trail! His evolution differences would be better if I had made some bigger changes. He always proves to be a help by going around in EXP quests. BAMBAMBAMBAMBAMM!! (Aotsuki Takao)
