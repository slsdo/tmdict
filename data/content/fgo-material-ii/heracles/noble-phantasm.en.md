### Nine Lives: Hundred Heads that Shoots to Death{{n1}}

Nine Lives.
The combat technique that Heracles had devised at the end of his long battle. A Heracles-style, so to speak.
Heracles have mastered all manners of armaments and overcome various monsters and labors.
He will display a sword’s greatest technique if using a sword, a spear’s greatest technique if using a spear, and a bow’s greatest technique if using a bow.
In FateGO, he releases the greatest technique by means of a great sword. A rush of extreme speed that inflicts one hundred attacks in one breath.
Nine lives has the meaning of possessing a life amount to 9, but this holds the implication that, due to the monsters he faces as enemies possessing the special characteristic of “reviving no matter how many times they are killed” altogether, he had achieved a combat method that “annihilates them no matter how many times they revive”.

### God Hand: Twelve Labors

God Hand.
The immortality obtained by means of the blessing (curse) of the gods. It transforms his body into a robust armor.
Invalidates all attacks of rank B and below. To add, it has as an even more concealed ability of automatic resurrection{{n2}} (raise) even upon death. The amount of resurrection stock is 11 times.
That is to say, Heracles will not vanish as long as he is not defeated for 12 times.
(It is fundamentally not being utilized in FateGO)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} 射殺す百頭. I had wanted to just call it Hundred Heads Deathshoot, but that sounds too FPS.
2. {{note2}} The kanji can mean resurrection or regeneration.
