Heracles is a bulging mass that can really gives off a sense of intimidation just by standing there. It was really fun, making him swell out on the account of his bursting mass=muscle. Now that once again I thought how many Servants has been added, there’s a part in me that think that maybe his design modification is a little bit too simple. Like, maybe I should’ve added in more color or something. I was really glad I got to be the one responsible for Heracles! (Asuza)
