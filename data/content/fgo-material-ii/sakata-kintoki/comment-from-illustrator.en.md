His design has been done for quiteeee a long time, and we finally got to see Kintoki-san in FateGO. It’s been a long time coming. But it was worth the wait! I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to work with such a charming character. I hope people are able to like the mischievous Kintoki who tends to play pranks and the cool Kintoki when he’s serious. I would be really happy if they do. Someday I want to try drawing Kintoki-san choosing sweets together with neighboring children in a dagashi store as they melt into the downtown night. (RAITA)
