Golden Eater.
The True Name of this Noble Phantasm is probably not this. It’s definitely not this, but it is invoked with such Name. Unreasonably Golden.
A Masakari imbued with the power of Raijin. It has such weight in which it certainly can’t be lifted without Kintoki’s Monstrous Strength.
Its destructive power rises through the explosion of its lightning-loaded cartridges.
The destructiveness varies depending on the number of cartridges used. The maximum is 15. Sometimes, jamming would occur.
More details can be seen in the illustration references…Its shape is probably not like this originally. Unreasonably Golden.

(It is used in Fate GO, but its True Name Release is not employed.)

Golden Spark.
Lightning is generated from the Masakari to mow down the targets. 3 cartridges are expended for the usage of this Noble Phantasm.

(It is used strictly as an Anti-Unit attack in Fate GO)
