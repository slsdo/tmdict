### Mind’s Eye (True): A

An insight cultivated through discipline and training. One possesses a combat logic to grasp with a presence of mind the state of affairs around themselves and the abilities of the enemies in a predicament, deducing the means of survival left in that situation.

Fergus has this Skill with a high rank because of the anecdote where he perceived that the existence of the “two huge bulls”, which was the reason why the greatest war of Ulster occurred, were really sent in by the gods as the chosen destroyers of Ireland.

### Valour: A

Negates mental interferences. Also, it even has the effect of increasing melee damage.

### Nature of a Rebellious Spirit: B
