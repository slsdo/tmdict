Since Fergus had a minor specification in relation to his face and figure, it resulted in the present impression where he does not become puzzled much. They are very easy to draw. His eyes, I mean. His equipment had been proceeding with a design similar to Cú Chulainn (Prototype)’s at first, but when I sent in a scribble of him wearing a western school uniform in the middle of the process, it grew into a discussion of ‘Let’s have him wear something where he’s like the leader of a group of juvenile delinquents’, and it settled down into the current design. It got to now where I cannot come up with anything for him except for this half-naked style, huh? (B-suke)
