Another name for this is The Spiral Rainbow Sword. An Anti-Army Noble Phantasm that boasts of a high-power and wide-range, making even landscape destruction feasible. In legends, it demonstrated a fearsome power where a shimmering drawn out from a swing of the sword “had cut off three hills.”

It had cut off the tops of the hills by means of “a shimmering from the sword that extended outwards like a rainbow” in the legends, but when wielded as a Noble Phantasm, Caladbolg’s aspect as a landscape destruction weapon has been pronounced. In other words, there is no use in arguing if it is a great attack or not that can break the earth apart. The Great Spin in the Sky of Heaven and Earth.

In later eras, it is said that Caladbolg was the model for the magic swords/holy swords that many heroes obtained. Also, it is the prototype of Excalibur Galatine.
