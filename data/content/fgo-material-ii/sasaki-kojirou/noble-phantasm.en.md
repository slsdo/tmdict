Tsubame Gaeshi.
A special move that cuts down the enemy from three directions simultaneously. It is not simply a “swift” slash; it truly happens simultaneously.
In order to achieve his goal of cutting down a swallow midflight with a longsword, the nameless swordsman who became the basis of this Heroic Spirit personality underwent an outrageous, straightforward training. This is the mystical sword that he had acquired at the end of it.

In the world of magic, it appears to be one of those known as multidimensional refraction phenomenon.
