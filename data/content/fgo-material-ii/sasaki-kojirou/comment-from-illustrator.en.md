He sure played an active role during the first chapter, huh. He had really helped me a lot as well.
You can say he sure isn’t lacking in for some good gag during interludes and dango quest. Still, his feature is actually on the slim side; he got those slit, almond eyes and beautiful silky hair. He’s all around a beautiful character. Also, I was like, totally surprised when he acted affectionate in My Room. By the way, would Anchin-sama never get implemented, I wonder. (Mata)
