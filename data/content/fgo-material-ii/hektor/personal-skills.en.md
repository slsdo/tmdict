### Military Tactics: C+

An instinctive ability for utilizing tactical knowledge not for one-on-one combat situations, but in battlefields where a large number of people are mobilized. An advantageous modifier is provided only in situations where one’s own Anti-Army Noble Phantasm is used or when conversely dealing with an opposing Anti-Army Noble Phantasm.

Particularly in defensive warfare, Hector acquires a high tactical ability bonus.

### Restart: B

The ability to withdraw from combat. Restores disadvantageous battle conditions to the battle’s initial turn (turn 1) and restores the condition of one’s techniques to their initial value.

### Proof of Friendship: C

In the case where a hostile Servant has no possession of a Mental Pollution Skill, that opponent’s fighting spirit can be suppressed to some extent, and one is then able to commence negotiations in a dialogue. In a Holy Grail War, an advantageous check is acquired at the time of forming temporary alliances.
