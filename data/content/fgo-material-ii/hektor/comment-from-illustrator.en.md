A hero in the Trojan Warâ€¦ to an old man who feels like he is bound to be aloof from the world. The image I referred to is a middle-aged man who has the nerve to become useless. A shrewd middle-aged man is nice, right? Because he was a very easy-to-understand character, it was fun to draw him. By the way, the design of his right arm is a creation added after he was finished. Since there was a request that wants to have his Noble Phantasm direction be flashy, then I can tell you that a remodelling of his right arm would be done for that flow of feeling. Although this weapon of his also has a strange shape, the setting says that it can be either a sword or a spear by shortening or extending its handle respectively. (BLACK)
