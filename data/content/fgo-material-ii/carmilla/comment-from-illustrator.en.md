Since the iron maiden was set as a Noble Phantasm, I designed her in a sadistic image to match up with that. In her final Ascension, I chose a scene that emphasizes insanity and inhumanity. It was very difficult to make her crinoline-like armour. Given that I love characters that are typical of queens, I delightfully accepted drawing her even though I was going to suffer doing so.
