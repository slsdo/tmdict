### Personality

Every factor of her life, such as her livelihood as a noble that spanned over many years, her contempt towards humans except for those who are her fellow blood relatives due to being hardened by them, and so forth, all pushed the former Elizabeth into a killer who seeks the bizarre. Haughty, proud, and conceitful, her body is coiled around with every vanity; it is like sulfuric acid had turned into a human form. If one touches her, all fine things will be inflamed immediately. And yet, stupidity exists at her root————If one puts it in another way, it is even possible to say that Carmilla has a faint goodness within her that is just on the verge of barely stopping her audacity.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Naturally, Carmilla is clearly evil. She will betray her Master, and she will even embrace the recognition of being called a traitor. But still, even if she does not go so far as… to serve them, if it is probably a Master with a bottomless goodness, one who is aware of, and furthermore, accepts her past, in that case, she will appear to become willingly cooperative.

### Dialogue Examples

“You make a pleasant cry. If you don’t mind, can you let me hear more of it when we return to the castle?”
“I hate myself. Abhor myself. Listen, as a matter of fact… I’m sure you’ll also hear the same answer if you ask ‘me’.”
“… Not going to touch me?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Elizabeth Báthory’s figure changed into the “Blood Countess” due to her legend being circulated. Unlike Elizabeth, there is still room for correction in her (although there is no room for forgiveness); a cruel existence through and through. Unmistakably an anti-hero, if circumstances originally allowed her to be summoned, it would probably be by a dark killer on the same level as her.

The Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu wrote “Carmilla” in the year 1872. Languid, the female vampire Carmilla possesses a charming beauty in some respects, and this novel provided a great influence for Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” as well.

And one can conclude that the person who became the model for Carmilla is her————Elizabeth Báthory. Elizabeth Báthory has anecdotes of giving somebody the impression of her as a fine sovereign, although even if meagre, but Carmilla’s current state tore off that influence. Elizabeth is obtaining some power of the Dragon Kind due to her Innocent Monster Skill, but even that was lost due to Carmilla taking the form of a complete vampire.

Furthermore, Elizabeth hates that she is merging with Carmilla despite being an identical existence. Elizabeth thinks “I musn’t become like her”, and if it is viewed from Carmilla’s perspective, Elizabeth is from the figure of her glorifying her absolutely intolerable youth. To speak of this simply, if it is viewed from Elizabeth’s side, it is “Such an incomplete thing that can’t grow accustomed to being that sort of idol is not my future self and should just drop dead!!”, and if it is viewed from Carmilla’s side, it is “My former self who wonders if she should wake up or not from her FOOLISH dream that seemingly settles on a dark history such as being an idol should just go to hell!!”
