“Love-Arrow – Romance-Arrow”, it can be read as ‘Missed Darling’.

An arrow fired with Artemis’ power of love towards Orion. Because it is shot together with her overflowing love, it causes tremendous damage along with maximum confusion on the target.

A peculiar attack that echoes out a sound that can be heard from somewhere. Mikotto{{n2}}.

An attack Noble Phantasm and a severe punishment executed on Orion. Instead of an arrow, the mascot Orion is nocked to the bow, and Artemis aims and shoots him at a man’s crotch. Based on the special characteristics of this Noble Phantasm, it is a technique restricted only for males that shall certainly kill the unfaithful.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Is A+ rank in the game profile.
2. {{note2}} I would say Mikotto is a Japanese word that’s very difficult to translate into English because it’s a pun. To explain the context, the root word of Mikotto is Mikon (yes, the one Tamamo says), which can mean ‘unmarried’ in English. One can say Mikon if they’re doing something in a style befitting the unmarried, or one can say Mikon in response to something that happened to them that will cause them to become/stay unmarried. In this case, a victim saying ‘Mikotto’ after getting hit in the balls is natural since I don’t think any woman will marry someone who can’t help them produce kids (if that’s part of their marriage goals).
