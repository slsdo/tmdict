Orion was not somebody to worry about. Sure, he is a stuffed (male) bear who is not cute enough to be liked by everybody, but nonetheless, one cannot conclude that he is not cute enough to the point that he would be dumped away. Because of his overblown individuality at the occasion of being a stuffed animal, everybody is saying that those clothes are Orion’s, and they are probably imagining that his original appearance is viewed as being right in the center of ‘that’ archetype. Although it is justified, he does not wear lower-body clothing.

And then, at first for Artemis, I thought of making her a flat-chested girl because of the occasion where she was named the virgin goddess that made up one element of Meltryllis, but in the first place, since there would be no reason for the current Artemis to materialize in a body that would not be liked by Orion, I did her design over again for a voluptuous body, saying “You’re kidding, someone like that is a virgin in this body?” So one can conclude that, if by some chance, there may be a loli goddess Artemis also existing in some dimension. Although, unless there is a change in the settings I heard about, her original form is planned to be in a boring figure that is neither a loli nor does it have huge breasts. (I-IV)
