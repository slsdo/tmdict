### Affection of the Goddess: EX

Because she likes Orion so much, it seems that Artemis was summoned with the former by allowing her status as a Divine Spirit to decline to the Heroic Spirit rank. As a proxy of Orion, Artemis is using his Skills to fight. However, as compensation, Artemis can only exercise power as a normal Servant.

### Bond to the Whimsical: A+

Originally, it is a Skill to shackle Orion with Artemis’ excessive love, but it acquired an increased offensive level of power towards males as a side-effect. According to the claims of a red bowman————“She claims that the effect is more powerful if they’re prone to adultery, but that’s probably her assumption.”

### Mind’s Eye (Fake): B-

Danger avoidance according to one’s intuition/sixth sense.

Since this is originally Orion’s own Skill, it is ranked-down, albeit slightly. Because Orion was a hunter blessed with the utmost talent, he would yawn carefreely, no matter what kind of predicament he was in too.
