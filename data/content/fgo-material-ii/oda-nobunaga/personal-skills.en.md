Charisma is a rare talent, and it can be said that B rank is sufficient for a leader of a country.

### Tenka Fubu: A

A unique skill belonging to Nobunaga, revolutionary of the era. A conceptual revolution that imposes the new upon the old.
Grants advantageous corrections to an extent on herself if her enemies are those with high rank “divinity” and “mystery”, or Heroic Spirits that are guardians of the system. With this, Nobunaga is able to fight advantageously against Heroic Spirit and Noble Phantasm possessing “divinity” and “mystery”.
On the other hand, against the likes of modern Heroic Spirits with thin mystery it displayes no effect whatsoever. The efficacy of her own Noble Phantasms and all of her Skills drops instead.
