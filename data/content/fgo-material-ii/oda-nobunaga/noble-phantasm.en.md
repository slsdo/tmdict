Three Line Formation.
Nobunagaâ€™s three line shooting formation. An anti-army Noble Phantasm that deploys 3000 matchlocks and fires a volley of shootings.
From the exceedingly famous anecdote of her destroying the warring states strongest riding corps, its power is increased against Heroic Spirits possessing the Riding Skill.
They are simple matchlocks against those without the Skill, but even so simply a volley of 3000 shootings is a threat of its own.

Dairokutenmaouhajun.
The true Noble Phantasm of Demon King Nobunaga, destroyer of gods and buddhas. A Reality Marble that transforms her into an existence wielding an absolute power against those possessing mystery and divinity. Visual-wise, it looks as if she took off her clothes. Yey!
The severe deeds that she had done during her live, represented in her setting ablaze Mt. Hiei, turned into a Noble Phantasm.
By means of the fear of Nobunaga that the people would embrace and accumulate in later years, and of the sense of awe for Nobunaga, it materializes as a great inferno.
For those possessing a high divinity, it is hard to even maintain their existence within it.
However, those with low divinity would as expected only felt a little hot.
(In FateGO, it is fundamentally not utilized.)
