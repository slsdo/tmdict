She was so cute in Gudaguda Order…. while feeling that, I was charmed by how her design combines between cool factor and her unbounded manner, and when they found out I had a go at drawing her, without even asking me whether I would take on the work, they forced me… err… entrusted me with task of drawing her official character art used in the game.
Be it being serious or being amusing, she is always so cute that I always enjoy it whenever I’m drawing her. Personally I think that she acquired the Heshikiri Hasabe after materializing. Together with the clothes. (pako)
