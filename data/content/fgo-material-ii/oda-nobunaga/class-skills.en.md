### Magic Resistance: B

Invalidate magic invocation with chant 3 verses or less.
It is hard to damage her even with great thaumaturgy or ritual spells.

### Independent Action: B

The ability to act independently for a period even if magic energy supply from the Master is severed.
At B rank, even if he loses his Master he is able to stay materialized for a period of 2 days. Seriously Nobbu, that a scout ability ainâ€™t it!
