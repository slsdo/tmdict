### Personality

The king of reform, who takes the title of demon for herself.
Haughty and full of confidence in herself, she possesses the flexible mind that is fond of new things and isn’t enslaved by antiquated customs. Soft on those she likes in self-righteousness, thoroughly cold to those she hates, and indifferent towards those without any use.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Specially favors the Master as her vassal. According to her: “You are the only vassal I have ever favored this much besides the Monkey. Rejoice!”

The demon king’s end was by the rebellion of her vassal; however, she doesn’t regret it, as it in itself is something “inevitable”.
She does not particularly hold any wish towards the Holy Grail, but it’s quite possible that she would use the Holy Grail itself for unprecedented ideas that is her forte and makes a mess out of everything.

### Dialogue Examples

“It is inevitable!”
“I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga!”
“I would allow jest, but not contempt. Never forget of this.”
“H-How exhausting…” (guda guda)
“Nobbu!” (*Small Nobu)
“Nobbu~!” (Big Nobu)

### Historical Image · Character Image

A figure that had truly brought about ruin to the Muromachi Shogunate, and had bestowed great influence in the ending of Onin War to the continuing long period of Warring States. One of the three great heroes of the Warring States, It is no exaggeration to say that this personage is the most famous figure in the history of Japan.

In early years he had been harshly known as the Fool of Owari, or the great fool, but became serious upon inheriting the position of family head and suppressing his brother and crushing the war daimyo “Imagawa Yoshimoto” who had been known as a Kaidouuchi no Yumitori{{n1}} with a somewhat desperate surprise attack. He then jumped out to the top in the race of unifying the country.

Afterwards, he completely demonstrated a natural eye for strategy, beat the hell out of the other daimyo in her surroundings, put them under her control and well extended her influence, and finally proceeded to the capital. After taking it as an easy game and putting on the composure that the warring state period is laughably complacent, as everyone would know, he would then meet her death at the age of 49 at Honnouji, just one step awaw from the unification of the whole country. The figure who unexpectedly embodies a man’s life of 50 years.{{n2}}

In FateGO, as can be seen Nobunaga is a woman. From the beginning, her father Oda Nobuhide had planned on giving the position as the head of family to her brother, Oda Nobukatsu. However, the time being the period of war, Nobukatsu’s caliber was judged to be impossible to protect House of Oda from then on, and so Kipposhi (later known as Nobunaga) who had an unusual hint for greatness despite being a woman was placed as the family head instead. Eh? It’s impossible for women to become the family head? Even the Dragon of Echigo{{n3}} seems to be a woman as well, what’s the problem then!? Don’t underestimate the warring states.

After inheriting the position of family head, she continued to behave as a male would. But the information regulation on that matter would then be transmitted in the later years as Nobunaga’s eccentricity in her younger days, such as being “the Great Fool of Owari”. It can be said that the concealment of Nobunaga’s various amusing episode was that of a woman was thanks to her retainer’s effort of information manipulation.

“Well, it is inevitable!”

### Connections with Characters

#### Okita Souji

Competed against her in a certain Holy Grail War. Being a modern Heroic Spirit with weak mystery, she should have had bad compatibility against her, but in FateGO suddenly their compatibility is reversed. Wowzers, Nobbu! Tomorrow is Honnouji!
