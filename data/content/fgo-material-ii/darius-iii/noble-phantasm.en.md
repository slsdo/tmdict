Athanaton Ten Thousand.
An army of ten thousand soldiers composed of moving corpses and walking skeletons appear and gather and form a “War Elephant of Death”, and with a formidable attack of magic energy they exterminate the opponent.
Athanatoi, the Immortals. The ten thousand elite troops that actually existed became a Noble Phantasm, and thanks to the legends that formed after their time their indestructibility and immortality has been emphasized.
It seems like an enormous monster, the “War Elephant of Death”, has been summoned, but actually it’s ten thousand of immortal soldiers that combine forming a kind of colony. It moves only under the commands of Darius III, and it’s devoted to annihilate the enemies of the king with its terrifying attacks of magic energy.
