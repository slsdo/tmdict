### Restart: A

The ability to withdraw from combat. Restores disadvantageous battle conditions to their initial state.

### Battle Continuation: A

The ability to continue combat.
Combat is possible even with injuries that place one on the verge of death, and they can remain alive so long as they do not receive a decisive fatal wound.

### Golden Rule: B

It measures the destiny of being blessed with money during oneâ€™s life.
Since he had enough assets to challenge Iskander several times during his life, Darius III possesses this skill at rank B.
His financial power is a part of his strength as much as his combat ability.
