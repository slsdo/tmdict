Iskandar’s rival… Darius III. As a character that summons the skeleton soldiers developed from the Immortals, I did his design to my likings with a variety of my preferences. As his design line is a black giant, his body colour is made close to Mr. Hassan of the same region, and for his religion, given that it is Zoroastrianism, his attire is made close to Angra’s, and finally, since the image colour of his rival, the Conquest King, is reddish-brown, I chose a purple colour with a dark navy blue hue so that he is symmetrical to his rival. It is a figure that matched the design balance in TYPE-MOON’s original view of history as well rather than the actual Persian attires of historical fact.

Darius’ crown of two horns is broken in the middle. Iskandar has an alias called the Two-Horned King… but one can conclude that the Conquest King in TYPE-MOON does not even wear such a helmet, even though one can conclude that those horns worn on Darius’ head were cut in the middle… That being the case, I made an interpretation… the title of Two-Horned King was simply transferred to Iskandar when he robbed and broke respectively the title and symbol of Two-Horned that Darius held onto.

Underneath the elephant’s jaw, I attached the tusks of a different elephant, and because these mutual bones are being fused with the elephant’s, the elephant’s state of being is fairly bigger than its actual skeletal structure. Although there is a design of wheels acting as the shields of the skeleton soldiers riding with and in the rear of Darius when he is mounting the elephant, it gives an impression that says the scythed chariot used by Darius and the elephant are being fused together.
