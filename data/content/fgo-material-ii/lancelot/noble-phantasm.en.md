Knight of Owner.
An ability Noble Phantasm that grants the attribute of “one’s own Noble Phantasm” on anything he holds.
No matter what kind of weapon or arms it is (for example, an iron pole, a fighter jet, or a gun), once he hold it in his hands, by surrounding it with magic energy it is turned into a pseudo-Noble Phantasm equal to D-rank (Berserker’s black magic energy surrounds and wraps the weapon in a vein-like manner in such cases).
In the situation where he takes hold of a Noble Phantasm of a higher rank than D-rank, he is able to put it under his control while keeping its original rank.
However, this ability’s range of use is limited to things that he can recognize as a “weapon”. (For example, even if he could transform fighter jet into a Noble Phantasm, he cannot do the same to aircraft carrier due to recognizing it as “something different from a weapon”.)
