I was like: Three stage transformation? No way, impossible! I’m really sorry… The original design wasn’t made with the assumption that it’ll be mass produced, so it would be a trouble to draw big changes. But perhaps it is exactly because of that that one can say the design can be used just as is even after several years passed. When in his third stage he changes to his characteristic weapon Arondight, secretly I retorted “No way it’s gonna have the same attack power as the iron pipe.” (Koyama Hirokazu)
