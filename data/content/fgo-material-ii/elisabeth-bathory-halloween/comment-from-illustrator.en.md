She’s a Caster that I drew under the impression that she’s a Lancer… like, I’m really sorry. It’s not a lance, it’s a fork, so please forgive me“! Her clothing is pretty showy, and I’m pleased with that. I don’t have a 5 star Caster other than Tamamo, so everytime I need some firepower for a Caster assault it’s always HalloEli. Due to that, I’m seeing her a lot, so I’m glad I got her clothes good. Please give more event Servants!!!! (Wada Arco)
