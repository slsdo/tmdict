### Personality

Pretty much the same with Elizabeth, so it’s omitted. This is totally not cutting corners, ok!?

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Elizabeth had been lost in the merry atmosphere of Halloween, so her chronic headache and sudden mood swing is currently being suppressed, fearlessly facing the Master from the front.
Due to her no longer attacking humans irrespective to her own intention, she will give it her all to gain the Master’s trust.
This is a one night dream. An impossible if that the criminal beyond salvation known as Elizabeth Bathory saw.

### Dialogue Examples

“Trick or treat! I don’t need to introduce myself, right? I, the Bloody Demoness Elizabeth Bathory, answers your passionate yell as I arrive here with my hidden dress!”

“Aaand I’m here! Right now, I can even save the world with my song! Come here, last stage! Caster, Elizabeth Bathory-----shall sing her greatest yet!”

### Role within the Game

The countess of blood who became the model for the vampire Carmilla… who got demonized but the Skill Innocent Monster…. who got infused with the attribute of Halloween due to the Holy Grail that she happens to pick up. This is beyond comprehension.
She is a heap of a Servant{{n1}}, admiring the culture of idol while also having the attribute of a princess dreaming in her castle. Completely cutting off her anecdote of piercing torture Iron Maiden by treating it as “totally have nothing to do with me”, she changes her weapon from a spear to a fork. Due to her overflowing magic energy, she is able to perform magic even if she had never really learn it. She herself totally doesn’t get how it works. An overflowing yet hidden talent, without a clue on how to use it; how very Elizabeth.

### Connections with Characters

#### Santa Alter

An undeniable relation as she is a festival-type Servant.
That being said, Elizabeth is also able to enjoy Christmas too; so she doesn’t get why she is being targeted.

#### Tamamo Cat

A drifting Servant who came as an helper, pronouncing herself as an all-purpose maid.
It was really surprising; employed even as a vital member during battle, she truly is all-purpose. Afterwards, she kept her company as a comparatively reliable friend.
