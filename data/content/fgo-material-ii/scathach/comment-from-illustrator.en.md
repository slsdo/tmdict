Being called the teacher of Cú Chulainn, her standard outfit was roughly settled upon, plus she became as such because of the order of making her erotic. Even I was surprised afterwards while being truly unaware of it, but she has similar colours with Bazett. Because she is already drawing a line from the World while also having tremendous self-confidence and courage as a transcendental person, she may be a rather complicated character by being a shaking calamity that had cooled down… Hey, for this reason, there is a dressing gown mode by breaking through the limits of her MAX Bond!
