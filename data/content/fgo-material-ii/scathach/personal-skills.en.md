### Primordial Runes: —

She possesses Runes, the Magical Crests of Scandinavia. These runes mentioned here, unlike those the modern mages use, are the Primordial Runes endowed with the power of the Age of Gods————Because of Odin, the Great God of Scandinavia, they are known to the world. She, who taught Cú Chulainn the 18 Primordial Runes, is also a powerful mage while being a warrior at the same time.

### God Slayer: B

As the gatekeeper of the “Land of Shadows”, a foreign region/haunted ground, her existential form that continued to slaughter Divine Spirits in great numbers has been converted into this Skill. It is particularly effective against Divine Spirits. A plus modifier is added to her attacks towards Divine Spirits, wraiths and Servants that are endowed with a Divinity Skill.

### Wisdom of the Haunted Ground: A+

The wisdom of the abyss, consequently acquired by transcending mankind, killing gods and being left behind at the Outside of the World. Excluding those that are characteristic of certain heroes, almost all Skills can be practically demonstrated at a proficiency of B~A Rank. Also, only to those who she truly acknowledged as heroes, she can teach such Skills to them too.

A Skill she often employs during combat is “Clairvoyance” for the foresight of combat situations. Even in the Ulster Cycle, she often predicted the future according to this foresight————even the last moments of her favourite pupil, Cú Chulainn.
