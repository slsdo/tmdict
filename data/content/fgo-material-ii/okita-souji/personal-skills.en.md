### Eye of the Mind (False): A

Avoiding danger through instinct or a sixth sense. Danger foretelling through natural talent, also known as foreboding. Comes also with a resistance to visual obstruction.

### Weak Constitution: A

Natural weakness, frail constitution. In Okita’s case, as result of being modified by the impression she left for posteriority in addition to the disease she had when she was alive, she received a curse similar to Innocent Monster. All of her actions come with the risk of a sudden status drop. Looking at the probabilities, it’s activation rate is actually not that high, but if it does activate during combat, the risks are immensurable.

### Shukuchi: B

A technique to instantly reduce the distance between herself and the opponent. The ultimate walking tecnique many martial arts try to achieve.
It’s not pure quickness, it’s a perfect combination of multiple phenomena, like walking techniques, defensive body movement, breathing and blind spots.
If it reached it’s max ranking (A), it would no longer be a simple technique, it would become dimension hopping, something on the realm of Xianshu (Senjutsu).
