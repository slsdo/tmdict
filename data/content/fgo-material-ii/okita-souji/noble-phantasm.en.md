### Mumyou Sandan-zuki: Avidya Three-Step Thrust

{{n1}}
The extraordinary genius swordsman Souji Okita’s deadly “magic sword”. It composed of the First Thrust, followed be the Second Thrust and Third Thrust.
A secret technique born from transcendental finesse and speed. She starts on the Hiraseigan stance and unleashes the hira-zukis not “almost at the same time”, but “exactly at the same time”.
Due to the contradiction of the equally positioned Second and Third Thrust piercing through even if the First Thrust is blocked, a localized event stagnation occurs on the tip of the sword. For that reason, the Three-Step Thrust becomes a physically unblockable stab.
A practical use for that is that the event saturation is excellent for destroying objects.

A light-blue haori. The excessively famous costume of the Shinsengumi, the man-slayer squad who shook the capital during the Bakumatsu, sublimated to a Noble Phantasm. By wearing it, Saber’s stats and weapons are ranked up. Saber’s usual weapon is the Kojiki Kiyomitsu, but with this effect, she upgrades to the sword that came to be considered her favorite by future generations, the Kiku Ichimonji Norimune.

### Makoto no Hata: Flag of Honesty

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>B</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Range</td><td>1~50</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>1~200 people</td></tr>
</table>

The Shinsengumi flag, with the single word “honesty” (makoto) printed on it. She can summon Shinsengumi soldiers in the space within a limited range from where the flag was hoisted. Each soldier is an independent Servant, but they have no Noble Phantasms and their power levels are all over the place. That aside, since all of them have the Independent Action Skill on a rank equivalent to E, they can operate even without a Master for a short while.
By the way, all Shinsengumi commanding officers have this flag and the faces and personalities of the soldiers may vary a little depending on the impression they left on who is activating it.
For example, Hijikata-san would be summoned as a bad Shinsengumi member, Kondou-san would be summoned as a stern Shinsengumi member and the guys the summoners were in bad terms with wouldn’t even show up. The Shinsegumi members Okita summons are the relatively popular ones.
