### Personality

A cute girl in her mid-teens, wearing westernized Japanese clothes. She is dressed like this in order to hide her absurdly conspicuous real outfit. She has her traits as cool-headed man-slayer as wells as her cheerful traits and fondness of children.
She is a genuine sword genius, with both innate talent and transcendental finesse, but she stands out in the Saber Class for her low Endurance stat and Magic Resistance.
That’s because she was modified by the impression she left for posteriority, in addition to the disease she had when she was alive. You could say she received a curse similar to Innocent Monster.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Although she is essentially a cold-headed man-slayer, she treats the ones she trusts like family, interacting casual and friendly with them.
Since she had barely romantic affairs when she was live, she is terrible at this type of conversation.
Her wish to the Grail is to “fight to the bitter end”. That’s her dearest wish, as it’s what she wanted to do when she was alive and ended never being able to.
Now that she has become a Heroic Spirit, she still regrets that she wasn’t able to fight with her friends until the end and strongly believes she doesn’t deserve to be called a Shinsengumi soldier.

### Dialogue Examples

“Shinsengumi First Troop Captain, Souji Okita. Sorry for coming unannounced!”
“Crossing swords is life or death, right?”
“First step, supersonic. Second step, distanceless. … Third step, absolute blade!”
“Great victory for Okita-san~! Yes, my body is fine, I still can go on and on! … -cough-!?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Souji Okita, First Troop Captain of the Shinsengumi, a security organization that operated mainly in Kyouto during the Bakumatsu.
Shinsengumi itself was already feared as a swordsman group, but he was praised as the strongest sword genius even among them.
During his childhood, he became an apprentice at the Shienkan, the Ten’nen Rishin-ryu dojo in Ichigaya, Edo, and there he met the people who would later become the core members of the Shinsengumi: Isami Kondou and Toshizou Hijikata.
He was skilled enough to serve as the Shienkan’s head instructor at a young age, and was unsurpassed in his sword talent.
In 1863, he moves to the capital and joins the Roushigumi (a group formed to defend the shogun) along with Kondou and Hijikata. After the Roushigumi was disbanded, he, Kondou, Hijikata and many others formed the Shinsengumi, where he was entrusted the position of First Troop Captain.
He displayed his sword talent in numerous battles, like the Ikedaya incident, and made the Shinsengumi’s name famous in the Bakumatsu era Kyouto. But at that time, Okita’s body started being consumed by his disease, and his condition was gradually getting worse. Eventually, he retreats from the frontlines to get treatment.
After that, he parts ways with companions and continues his treatment, but in 1868, he died before recovering in Sendagaya, Edo. It’s said he passed away without ever finding out that Kondou died beheaded 2 months before.
“We pledged our swords together, crossed the eras together, fought together.
Even if this journey leads only to a pointless death at its end, that is how I wanted to live. I didn’t want to stay staring at the sky under the warm light of the eaves.
All I needed was to stay with the word “honesty” by my side until the very end.
…No.
Now is my time to do so”.

### Connections with Characters

#### Oda Nobunaga

We fought against each other in one Holy Grail War. A very advantageous match up for me, since I can bust Archer’s shooting advantage with Shukuchi and her better anti-Mystery abilities are not strong against me.
… Wait, no, due to FateGO’s class advantage system, the advantage was turned against me!? This suck!!

#### Li Shuwen

We fought against each other in one Holy Grail War. The way he goes around murdering enemies barehand in Lancer form obviously fills our Okita of Mibu with question marks.

#### Sasaki Kojirou

Whaaaat… By “swallows”, you mean actual swallows?
