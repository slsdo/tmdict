### Magic Resistance: E

As she is a Heroic Spirit from an era with lower Mystery, don’t expect anything good from her Magic Resistance. Just a token addition to identify her Class. Did people even use magecraft during the Bakumatsu to begin with…? Maybe Feng Shui they did use…

### Riding: E

Just a token addition, she has no historical registers of horse-riding.
