When facing strong enemies, the party of Jeanne + Andersen + Tamamo made me feel amazing…thank you all. Have to be honest, I wanted to just draw more tails, but the 2nd ascension is more about changing of clothes. So when drawing there are parts that finishes with some of my reasons due to the overall balance, but I thought “When I get her I will ascend her all the way!”. Though, it will look a bit strange if you put her final ascension in your party. Tamamo has many reflection points… (Wada Arco).
