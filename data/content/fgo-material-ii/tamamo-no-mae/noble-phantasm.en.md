Suiten Nikkou Amaterasu Yano Shizuishi{{n1}}.

A Noble Phantasm in the shape of a mirror. Temporary release state of the divine treasure Weightstone of Tamamo (Tamamo Shizuishi).

This treasure is the later Yata Mirror, the object of worship for Amaterasu Oomikami, prototype of Mononobe clan’s Ten Sacred Treasures, and is said to have the power to revitalize the soul and life force.

Originally it is a divine treasure among divine treasures with the power of the Underworld that can revive the dead, but she cannot use that much power in her current form.

The rank is D, very weak contrary to its origin, but this is because only a very small portion of its power can be released. When use in the 9 tails form, it becomes an EX-rank Anti-World Noble Phantasm.

The Noble Phantasm’s effect is creating a Bounded Field which intercepts the principle of eternal, setting all cost of magic to zero. In other words, infinite magic energy.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Suiten in Suiten Nikkou is the Japanese name of the Hindu god Varuna. Tokoyo (the term alone means “eternal”) is the paradise in Shinto, said to be where the Shinto gods went to after they finished their job of building the land. It’s neither the underworld nor Heaven (Takamagahara), but a place where all things are eternal, like Shangri-la, Eden…etc. “Timeless fruits” grow in this place, effect sounds like Golden Apples on crack, as you eat one of these you automatically become eternal, no need to eat again and again. The same Tokoyo is used in the name of her poison curse blast - Land of the Eternal Bane. Because whoever visits Tokoyo will become eternal, the Noble Phantasm basically create a Bounded Field which applies some principles of that place in the area, allowing the constant refreshing of life force and magic energy.
