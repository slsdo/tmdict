### Witchcraft: EX

Secrets to grant status and assets (for males), seducing the ones with power (for females), divination of one’s time of death…etc. She doesn’t use them much due to past experience.

### Shapeshift: A

To mold a borrowed body. Technique used by Chinese millennial fox yokai identified with Tamamo-no-mae. It was used by Daji to possess/transform during the Yin-Zhou revolution (described in Fengshen Yanyi - Investiture of the Gods). Due to past trauma, she doesn’t use it often.

### Fox Wedding: EX

The skill Item Creation uniquely modified. She invented this skill after seeing the Noble Phantasm of a certain JK rival. “Tenkiame{{n1}} is MY specialty!!!”. Can only be a fox miko’s cheat skill. Tamamo unilaterally declares a wedding, causing a sunshower of gifts onto allies who happen to be standing nearby. Chill Amaterasu, chill!

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Tenkiame - Sky Demon Rain is Suzuka Gozen’s Noble Phantasm. Sunshower - the weather phenomenon referred to as Kitsune no Yomeiri (Fox Wedding) - in Japanese is also called Tenkiame.
