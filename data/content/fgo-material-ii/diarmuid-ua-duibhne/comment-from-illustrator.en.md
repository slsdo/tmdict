Diarmuid was my favorite Servant since Zero so I was happy to draw him! But at the same time, I never regretted so much to be bad at drawing muscles. I went through Hell. Iâ€™m sorry. The clothing at the Ascension 3 Stage is very cool. This was suggested by Takeuchi-sensei. Knight clothing style. A ladykiller. (Mata)
