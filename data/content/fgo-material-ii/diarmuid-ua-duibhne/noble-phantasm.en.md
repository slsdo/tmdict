### Gáe Dearg: Crimson Rose of Exorcism

Gáe Dearg.
The crimson long spear. Negates magical effects of the target touched by the blade.
Basically, a Noble Phantasm that has the ability to nullify magecraft defense.
Steals the magical effects from defensive equipment braided with magecraft like Saber’s armor, magecraft, or magecraft-like strengthening/skill boost by the Noble Phantasm 『A knight does not die with his hands empty』, and reduces them to a state of only physical defense.
The object of negating mana isn’t limited only to guards, but since it’s displayed 『only the part touched by the blade』 and 『only the moment in which the blade is touching』, it’s not suitable for defensive usage. Also, it can’t overthrow the effects of contracts or curses entwined in the past, as well as the effects of already completed magecraft. A spear that could be called a 『Noble Phantasm killer Noble Phantasm』, but this effect of exorcism alone can’t destroy Noble Phantasms. In the end, it negates the effects 『only the moment in which the blade is touching』.
Against those who don’t use magecraft, it’s a simple spear, but it’s unlikely not to use anything magical in a battle between fellow Servants, not flashy but a really useful Noble Phantasm.

### Gáe Buidhe: Yellow Rose of Mortality

Gáe Buidhe.
The yellow short spear. Inflicts unhealable wounds. Impossible to dispel by normal means, wounds made by this spear won’t heal as long the spear isn’t destroyed or Diarmuid doesn’t die.
The mechanism through which any treatment or regeneration can’t be healed, is by making the damage dealt by the spear reduce the upper limit of the maximum HP. Therefore, even with treatment and regeneration, it won’t be healed further from that because the 『wounded state』 is the fully healed state.
Just a spear in decisive battles of brief duration, but thinking about the premise of fighting the same opponent multiple times over a long period of time, it’s like a body blow that works slow yet certainly.
If the target isn’t a Servant, a lethal effect like bleeding to death over time can be expected.
Same as 『Crimson rose of exorcism』, it lacks flashiness, but it’s an extremely easy to use Noble Phantasm. Incidentally, he who is the user won’t be hurt by this spear. Used as a set with Crimson rose of exorcism in FateGO.
