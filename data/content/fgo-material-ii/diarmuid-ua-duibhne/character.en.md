### Personality

Fervently loyal, a Heroic Spirit-like Heroic Spirit that esteems honorable battles.
In life, he broke the affection he received and betrayed his lord, and because of that his lord let him die without helping him, but he doesn’t regret his action of having chosen love over loyalty, nor grudges his lord for having let him die.
The story of his tragic love with the princess Gráinne, would later become the model for the story of Lancelot and Guinevere.
That nobility is hard to understand by others that aren’t the same type of person as him, and as a result of him having swallowed even that mistake, cracks will be more spread……
Despite having often met this kind of tragedies, his fundamentals never changed.
However, even for such a man, things have their limits. When confronting malice that doesn’t think about others, while his heart is burned by feelings of resentment, he has also spewed anger, laments, and curses.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

There are no regrets in the conduct taken in life, or the destiny he chose.
However, if he’s given a second life, that time he’d choose and fight with loyalty……
A person who participates in the Holy Grail War with that kind of feelings.
Servants have, contract apart,『freedom to want the Holy Grail』, but in his case it’s not that he wants the Holy Grail, but that he aims to 『offer the Holy Grail to his lord』.
Thus, his conditions that are different from those of ordinary Servants, sometimes bring misunderstandings about his loyalty……

### Dialogue Examples

『Who must win now is Saber? Lancer? Neither of them. What should win here, is the 「path of the knight」 that we serve ――― Isn’t that right? Heroic Spirit Artoria』
『My dearest wish of victory, I entrust it to the blade of the King of Knights. I leave it to you, Saber』
『I won’t kill my Master. I won’t kill Saber’s Master. She and I don’t wish to end things like this. Never forget it. If you survive now at this place, it’s for the nobility of the King of Knights』

### Historical Image · Character Image

A prominent warrior of the Knights of Fianna led by the hero of ancient Ireland, Fionn mac Cumhaill.
Appears in the group of mythological stories about the Knights of Fianna called the Fenian cycle. He had two spears called Gáe Dearg and Gáe Buidhe, and two swords called Moralltach and Beagalltach, and in his graceful face there was a magical spot given by a fairy that charmed women.
This spot, invited to and brought calamity. Having captivated Fionn’s fiancée Gráinne, he ended up eloping with her.
After wandering for several years, Diarmuid, who was allowed to return to the service of Fionn, who had finally calmed his anger, officially married Gráinne. But at one point, Diarmuid received a serious injury that left him moribund from a demonic boar while hunting. Diarmuid would have recovered if he had drank spring water scooped by Fionn’s healing hands, but Fionn intentionally or casually spilled the water twice, and Diarmuid died.

### Role within the Game

In chapter 5 『North America Great War of Myths』, he appears in combination with who once was his lord, Fionn mac Cumhaill.
They serve as the Celtic faction’s advance-guard, but the delicate situation in which he receives sarcasm from Fionn with every little thing, no matter if he’s aware or not, perplexes the protagonist side. A master-servant relation with an odd tempo, but they were compatriots that matched their breathing.

### Role in Past Works

In 『Fate/Zero』, appears as the Servant of the prestigious mage Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald.
Perhaps a mischief of destiny, his Master’s fiancée Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri becomes charmed by his magical spot, and as in the past, he ends up in the same composition of discord with the lord that ends up taking his life.
