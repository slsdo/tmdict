The materialization of the Labyrinth where Asterios was confined in. A Great Magecraft exceedingly similar to a Reality Marble, it was created in the Underside of the World. Asterios merely has to reminiscence “the place he once lived in”, and once it manifests after, it takes form with a difficulty level that complies with the popularity of the concept called the “Labyrinth”.

After it manifests, it will not disappear unless either Asterios is defeated or Asterios has annihilated his opponents. Even once it disappears, it is possible to rebuild it again when some time passes. However, in doing so, if it is not a labyrinth different from the previous installment, one can probably just downright walk out of it there and then. Because once the labyrinth is solved, it is no longer something where one can lose their way from.
