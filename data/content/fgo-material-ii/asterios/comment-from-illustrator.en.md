At first, the assignment came to be a monster with a bull’s head, but while I was going to suggest something, I had a chat where they want me to differentiate him from the enemies, so it resulted in the design of a bull mask similar to how it is now in its portrayal. The moment the direction became certain, I received a great response, “This young beast-man, is… it!!!”, from Mr. Takeuchi approximately at the time when a rough sketch of his current state was revealed. Within the game, his hair tied to his battle sprite visibly fluttering around like a tail is a favourite of mine. (Shima Drill)
