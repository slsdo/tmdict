### Personality

Due to his blood as a human being faintly remaining in him, a conversation is possible with Asterios, but there is only a small chance for that to happen. Although his intelligence is like a child’s, he is extremely wise. He further understands ethics, common sense, etc., as a human being, and for that reason, he constantly lives while bearing feelings of guilt towards his very existence as he lives on.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Fundamentally obedient, Asterios does not interfere with his Master, nor does he choose to ignore them. As long as his Master treats him as Asterios as much as possible, Asterios is in a good mood.

Asterios usually loiters around Chaldea, having a good time with Euryale.

### Dialogue Examples

“Get lost, wander, and then, die!”
“Yeah… I don’t dislike, being gentle. This place, is warm, isn’t it?”
“I’ll eat you…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A monster that had been born with the head of a bull on the body of a man, during the time when a bull and Pasiphaë – the wife of Minos, of whom he is the king who ruled over the island of Crete – bore a child.

Minos was exchanging promises with the Sea God Poseidon to sacrifice a bull presented from the latter, but in some year, while he still has the valuable Bull of the Gods for instance that should have been sacrificed originally, Minos had sacrificed a different bull instead. Poseidon, who had his promise trampled underneath Minos’ foot, placed a curse on Pasiphaë, the wife of the king, having induced her so that she will bear a sexual desire towards bulls. And like that, so was born Asterios, his name meaning “one who rules the stars”, but because he possesses the body of a man with the head of a bull, he was given the name “Minotauros”, which means the ‘Bull of King Minos’. Minos was at a complete loss because of the queen’s scandal, so he ordered the famous artisan Daedalus to construct “a place where one can never get out from”————namely, the Labyrinth.

Because of the king’s command, it became a usual custom to offer seven boys and girls each as a sacrifice to Asterios. Understandably, he cannot offer the people of his own country, so King Minos demanded from Athens, the state that he invaded, to offer sacrifices for his compensation.

On the occasion of the sacrificial group being elected the third time around, Theseus, the hero of Athens, came forward personally for the sake of defeating Asterios. Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos, fell in love with the handsome Theseus at first sight. Theseus, with Ariadne’s cooperation in securing an escape route from the impossible-to-escape Labyrinth, succeeded in realizing the defeat of Asterios.

————What a wonderful heroic tale.

It was neither his mother’s responsibility nor his own responsibility that Asterios was a monster. Whereas it was said to be his father’s responsibility, for he valued the bull that should have been sacrificed to the gods. Nevertheless, the boy had never blamed his father, not even with just a single word.

It is not because Asterios loves his father. But if there is such a strong emotion out there, it can surpass the resentment sealed within himself. His father paid tribute to him with the most important name of all, and he was saved. Someday, with the salvation of being slain by a hero————he can be proud, of the name of Lightning (Asterios). To a monster like himself, this beautiful name is, to a degree, more than what he deserves. At only just that time, he could not be even capable of hating his father.

“I wanted to save you.”

Theseus, who noticed that Asterios was only a boy, threw these words with his heartfelt thoughts put into it.

The prayer of Theseus is over there, in the distant future. It will be fulfilled, in the endless Okeanos sea. For Theseus, that trip by boat, and the chats with his fellow comrades about this tale, were cherished memories where just about everything around him was visibly shining, just like how a gemstone would sparkle.

————If it is for that, one should not even hesitate in any extent to risk their life.

### General Armaments

The Labrys… A very gigantic axe that can turn into a “double-edged blade” by installing one hatchet used for ritualistic ceremonies to another back-to-back. Asterios has separated it into two for his utilization.
