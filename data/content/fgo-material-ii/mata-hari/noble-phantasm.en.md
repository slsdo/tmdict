The realization of the legend called Mata Hari; a brainwashing Noble Phantasm. By means of a bewitching dance, she forcibly paralyzes people’s trains of thoughts. Ordinary people and Masters are a matter of course, but Servants who do not have mental resistance Skills and are not under Madness Enhancement also fall under this Noble Phantasm’s effects, regardless of their gender. A person who failed at their check will basically be Mata Hari’s puppet.

The effects last until the sun rises. However, because evidence of this Noble Phantasm being employed are not left behind, it can even be repeatedly used on the very same person. Also, in the case that a person failed at their check even once, they will bear a handicap on those checks next time and thereafter.
