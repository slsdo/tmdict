You know, I agreed that it would be nice if I drew an erotic elder sister, so I designed one as this dancer and female spy. Her usual personality is full of positivity, so with that being the case, she does not make me have an impure feeling in designing her as such. Well, at first, it even looked like there was such a scene where she attacks with the cloths on her armsâ€¦

Although I submitted various colouring plans for her, there was even one among those draft plans where she has something like tanned skin. For her character performance, although she is regarded as someone extraordinarily difficult to use, I feel happy since I receive numerous reports saying she had been raised up to her final Ascension (Koyama Hirokazu)
