### La Mort Espoir: Death is the Hope for Tomorrow

The materialization of the true execution tool: the guillotine. Whether or not it can be avoided is decided not by one’s resistance to curses or Luck, but according to the concept of “whether or not one can bear with the fate of dying eventually.” It is a so-called “mental interference”-type Noble Phantasm, and heroes who have anecdotes of “being executed” rather than dying in battle undergo a disadvantageous check.

When the True Name is invoked within mid-range, the manifestation of the guillotine happens. One second later, the guillotine drops, and the judgement takes place. In the case that the target failed the check, the guillotine falls without change and their head is decapitated.
