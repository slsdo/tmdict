### Executioner: A++

Severing evil with evil; the ultimate judgement act. Damage increases towards those of the Evil Alignment. Also, a Servant will also become a target in the case that the acts of that Servant are regarded as evil.

### Medical Techniques: A ⮕ A+

Modern medical techniques that surpassed the medical technology in those days – when superstition was running rampant – by several levels. Still, this Skill is not compared by the standards of the modern era, but is instead determined by the standards of the era that the Servant lived in.

### Human Anatomy Research: B

A concept placed on the “other side” of execution and medical techniques.

Sanson was not negligent in doing research on where he could wound the human body that would result in the person not dying, prognostic symptoms not being left behind, etc. Speaking of it from another angle, he is good at understanding where it is okay to wound someone at the time of fighting against them.
