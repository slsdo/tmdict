### Personality

A mild young man who dearly loves “humans”. Sanson hates “evil”, but not “evil people”. He believes in God, but at the same time further understands that God “does nothing.” For that reason, he bears the lamentable sense of duty of severing “evil” with “evil”. Extremely strict in regards to the law, he has a motive where if he is able to achieve victory against an enemy, then he wants the “death penalty” to be called off, and while he accepts doing battle against Servants, he does not kill Masters.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Sanson basically revolves around the position of serving his Master with a neutral point of view. However, in the case that his Master attempted to coerce him into doing evil deeds such as eating souls, it will lead to hostile acts from Sanson, acts that could include his suicide.

Although Sanson appeared as Berserk Assassin in “Orleans – Hundred Years’ War of the Wicked Dragons”, his character on that occasion was obstinate since he had literally gone mad. He does not want to give pain to lawbreakers and evildoers. Even if it was an unconscious desire, a desire where he rather wished for a slash so swift and painless, it gives the victims the illusion of a heavenly paradise as consideration for their deaths.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Assassin. I have called on you, responding to your summons.”
“The disappointing thing is that I cannot kill humans. Nevertheless, if that is fine with you, then please use me.”
“It is an ironic way of life. It is because I do not want to hurt people that consequently, I studied the techniques on how to hurt them.”
“There are no likes of pride in a household of executioners. I do at least mean that I have no pride. The reason for that is just… love. For them at least, for they appear to be struggling in pain up to the point just before their deaths————”

### Historical Image · Character Image

An executioner at the time of the French Revolution. Charles-Henri Sanson was involved with the executions of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, and many others. The reason that a mere executioner got so famous was that, in spite of being in an executioners’ household that boasted a history of more than two hundred years, and in spite of being in the faction that opposed the death penalty too, it was the result of things like being the person that carried out the second most death penalties in history.

The Sanson House was a contradictory existence, having lived while being financially blessed despite having a low social status as “executioners”. Even when the country turned around because of the French Revolution, a verdict of innocence was handed down against the execution of the Sanson House which had continued for generations. To guillotine without their will; that was their role.

Charles-Henri Sanson, just then in those turbulent times, became the Executioner————Monsieur de Paris. He executed targets from every social class, from figures such as Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre whose reputations were literally linked with the history of France, to as far as obscure people.

In particular, the execution of Louis XVI seemed to be an extreme shock for even Sanson, and after Louis XVI’s execution, Sanson entreated some priests to hold a Mass for the King. That was a counter-revolutionary crime at the time of the French Revolution, and it was something so serious, it became a capital crime, but even so, Sanson repeatedly held a Mass for the King.

It has also been noted that Charles-Henri Sanson was an exceptional advocate for equality even in those days. He helped abandoned patients as a physician, and he accumulated research so that the people having their sentences carried out would have no pain and prognostic symptoms.

————Supposing that…
Even if it was something anybody and everybody would not concern themselves with, even if it was something that would not be rewarded…
Sanson would put up with the agony and respectably continue on with that role.

### Connections with Characters

#### Marie Antoinette

As everyone knows, a respected and beloved queen, maiden, and eternal existence. For what reason did Marie leave those words behind to Sanson without even any fear of sorts just before her execution?

#### Amadeus Mozart

As everyone knows, they have a relationship as fellow perverts… “As rivals, we are rivals!”

#### Chevalier d’Éon

“I am sorry, but can we not be together?“ they said. Sanson wants to cry a little.
