Not to mention the Noble Phantasm’s guillotine and the 4 horse heads on his shoulders, the designs of his outfits, such as the wheels, ladders and crosses, are used as motifs of torture and execution tools. For the fact that he is a Servant of the French Revolution, I looked up the details of his bloodline, career, etc. as well, and it was extraordinarily enjoyable.
