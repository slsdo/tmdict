A poem she puts her heart into reciting. A form of Summon Noble Phantasm, which can temporarily manifest an apparition through a poem composed by Sotooshi no Iratsume (often considered one of the Three Gods of Japanese Poetry).

“Tonight is the nightthe one I wait for shall arrive.The spider’s webin the bamboo grassstands as proof.”

The spider mentioned in the poem was not supposed to have any connections to the tsuchigumo…But still, when its True Name is released, a member of one of the off-standard tsuchigumos sealed away by her onmyoudou teacher Abe no Seimei is summoned and performs an attack. During this attack, Murasaki Shikibu is riding the tsuchigumo, which is most likely the reason why her Saint Graph was established as Rider.

It’s said to be very potent against a target who knows love. For targets who don’t know love, it’s not too effective.
