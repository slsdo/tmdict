### Summer Night Black Widow: EX

A Skill closely related to the appearance of her First Ascension. A widow displaying a suspicious smile in the summer nights… she is known as Black Widow! Her costume is designed after the murder mystery archetype of the owner of an enigmatic mansion, especially the culprit versions of the archetype, but she’s not really the culprit of any incident. She’s just having fun with cosplay.

By the way, Murasaki Shikibu is not consciously aware of the fact what she’s doing is cosplay, so she can get pretty flustered when this is pointed out to her.

### Bookworm Maiden (Summer): A

Summer Murasaki has a huge preference for summer stories. She’s reading all sorts of stories related to the summer, from sci-fi all the way to period dramas. She’s also reading a lot of murder mysteries and horror novels taking place in the summer, and as a result, Summer Murasaki is quick to identify murder tricks and horror tropes. She also knows quite a few movies, but for whatever reason, she shows some bias toward horror movies from the 80s and 90s. (It appears that a professor in Chaldea taught her everything she knows about horror movies)

A Skill closely related to the appearance of her Third Ascension. As a consequence of watching many old movies, Summer Murasaki developed a big interest in 80s idols, especially their summer outfits, assuming these are the summer outfits of the present day.

### Taste for the Macabre (Summer): C++

A Skill closely related to the appearance of her Second Ascension. By familiarizing herself with murder mysteries and horror novels, Summer Murasaki gained a unique taste for clothes, assuming these are the summer outfits of the present day.

This is why she carries a crutch despite her ankle not being sprained and is covered in bandages despite not being injured. Everyone she sees keeps asking “Are you hurt?”, but every time it happens, Murasaki gives them a kind and considerate explanation of what’s actually going on, ultimately leading them to the somewhat confused conclusion that she’s doing cosplay.
