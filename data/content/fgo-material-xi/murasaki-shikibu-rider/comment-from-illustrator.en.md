For her 1st Ascension, I set out to make something simple and easy to draw based on her theme color: purple. For her 2nd Ascension, I gave her a school uniform to match Summer Raikou. The intended character archetype for the design was the frail bookworm girl, but I may have overdone it… For her 3rd Ascension, I thought it be fun to go with a swimsuit she’ll never choose of her own will, something inspired by the idol swimming tournaments of the good old days. Looking back at all of them now that enough time has passed, I was pretty excessive for all Shikibu swimsuits. (Honjou Raita)
