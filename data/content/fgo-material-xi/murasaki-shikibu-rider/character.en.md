### Personality

As a result of reading every summer-related story she could get her hands on, Murasaki Shikibu became a lot more knowledgeable about murder mysteries and horror novels and also learned a little about horror movies. When the summer ends, she’ll surely return to her usual librarian self right away…

However, she liked those clothes a lot more than she expected, so she could still wear them any time. Not as casual wear, of course, but she will still secretly indulge in her costumes in the hidden depths of the underground library or the private area behind the counter. If you happen to see her doing that, try saying “You don’t need to be shy, you can dress yourself like that every day”. She’ll be happy to hear it. If you say “You don’t need to be shy, you can wear cosplay every day”, you may see Murasaki trying to tell you’re wrong, trying to somehow deny the fact that what she’s doing is cosplay, for whatever reason.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Pretty much the same as the regular Murasaki Shikibu (Caster).

### Dialogue Examples

“So this is another form of modern summer outfit… I’m not sure what I’m looking at but it certainly shows there is a lot more to it than I had assumed.”

“This is Murasaki Shikibu: Bookworm Schoolgirl Style.”

“How do you like it, Master? A most classic example of an up-to-date outfit… What? You don’t know what this is themed after…? Huh? Err… You see, this was supposed to be a bathing suit in Shouwa idol fashion, at least according to the information I found in Chaldea’s database… Huh? Did I make a mistake?”

“Tsuchigumo, it’s your time to shine.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Exactly the same as Murasaki Shikibu (Caster).

### Character Image in “FateGO”

“A widow clad in an enigmatic dark swimsuit. The words coming out of her lips are enigmatic, chilling, and ominous, hinting at her macabre tastes. Will anyone survive this summer journey…?”

What you read above is only the impression she gives off with her outfits. Rider Murasaki Shikibu is not actually a culprit or a mastermind of any incident. A gorgeous widow in a black swimsuit.A suspicious girl in seifuku.A woman in a Showa idol swimsuit…Murasaki Shikibu chose multiple forms for this summer, but they are all just dress-ups. She’s simply having fun with different costumes. In other words, this! Is! Cosplay!

### Connections with Characters

#### Minamoto no Raikou

“Lady Raikou, I, Kaoruko, have also changed my wardrobe! Pardon? Unacceptable? HUH?”

#### Tawara Touta

“Lord Hidesato never fails to compliment my summer outfit whenever he sees it. What a great honor it is to be complimented by Lord Hidesato…”

#### Sakata Kintoki

“Is Lord Kintoki… facing any health issues? A while after I’ve put on my summer outfit, I’ve been noticing him avoiding eye contact. I’m honestly worried.”

#### Watanabe no Tsuna

“Lord Tsuna, Lord Tsuna? I’ve noticed that you saw me and nodded with a solemn expression of confirmation. E-exactly what assumption of yours have you seen proven true?!”

#### Sei Shounagon

“N-no, that’s n-not it. I was most certainly not inspired by Nagik… by Lady Sei Shounagon in the choice of this school-style present-day outfit. I-it’s true!”

#### Caesar

“I believe you should be leaving already… Look at the state of Lady Cleopatra’s face… err… err… ”

#### Osakabehime

“Huhu, believe it or not, Lady Osakabehime helped me choose these summer outfits! I cannot thank her enough for it!”

#### Ashiya Douman

“The illustrious monk… shifts wildly between enjoyment and boredom. I can’t exactly say he wasn’t like that in the days of Heian, but ah… The Saint Graph of an Alterego is a heavy one to bear.”

#### Illyasveil

“Illya has taught me about recent trends. Truly fascinating lessons…”
