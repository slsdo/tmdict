There are times where it looks like Himiko is dozing off to some extent, but that is probably just the viewer’s imagination.

### Charisma of the Shrine Maiden: B

The natural talent to command an army. Increases the abilities of allies during group battles. A rare talent, it is possible to say that having Rank B in this is sufficient for one to lead a whole country as its monarch.
Himiko’s Charisma is in the form of her governing her people accordingly with her oracles.
