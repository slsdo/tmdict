Communicating with something inhuman, Himiko acquires an intellect from a domain that no human intellect can reach. At the time of its True Name Release, innumerable mirrors spread out to the surroundings, deploying multiple projections of information about different time periods and areas, and by then using her own body as a medium, Himiko observes events that are confirmed to happen in the near future.

Furthermore, during its deployment, the Noble Phantasm emits a mysterious wave that activates the powers that primitive humans possess within Himiko’s allies in its surroundings.

At the time of its maximum release, it is even possible for the foresight’s outcomes themselves to be changed, although it is a faint possibility.

Himiko herself thinks “This is the Voice of Heaven, right?!”, among other things, but even said person does not truly understand what those acts that were referred to as “oracles” were.

By the way, it is said that Himiko had never received an allusion concerning her destined person from the Voice of Heaven.

“Haaaahh~… Even though I understand everything except the things about myself… Who did such a thing to Himiko?”
