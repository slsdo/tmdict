When I first had the offer to draw Ms. Himiko, the expectation for me was to examine her from the viewpoint of history as far as I can go, but… although it was obvious to see, the fact is, there were hardly any descriptions concerning her personally, aren’t there? I do not even see anything about her outfits except that it is something airy… Despite being a figure who has more than enough name recognition, she was a difficult character whose design has no starting point to work with.
