### Personality

The appearance of Himiko’s demeanour is like an energetic and sunny girl who is without worries, but the power of Mystery hidden within that body of hers is something so tremendous, she does not feel ashamed in professing herself to be the Arbitrator of Light.

Sometimes with oracles, sometimes with brute for-… no, it is nothing. Let us leave the matter of conflicts being subdued with various methods like that.

Although one cannot judge from the time when Himiko conducted herself as Queen, she was originally a young tender-hearted woman who considered rejoicing in the light of the Sun, among the crops of the Earth, and from the smiles of the people – as well as living together with nature – to be good things.

Incidentally, Himiko somehow has a strange rain woman disposition where she would bring the rain with her whenever she goes out. Given that it would rain whenever she tried to go out, when concerning those results, she was profusely convenient as a shrine maiden who prays for rain as well.

“… Ugh, heavy rain again. Why is it always pouring rain like this during the times where I try to go out?…
Huh? It helps the rice plants grow? Yeah, yeah. Raised floor-style though; don’t forget to build the granaries with raised floors.”

By the way, the greatest secret that came out from Yamatai-koku is that Himiko’s signature move is a closed fist punch, which was forged by her bone-breaking divinations.

“Knockout blow! Himiko Punch!”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

To her Master, Himiko will perform an oracle for them as a way for them to arrive at a better future. When she is silent, the atmosphere around her feels queen-like, but when her queenly character is in off-mode, she wants to be frank and easy to talk to like an older sister in the neighbourhood.

### Dialogue Examples

“Hey, look upon the power of Yamatai-koku’s first Queen!”
“I’m going to predict. Umm, we’ll probably win… no, we’ll absolutely win!”
“Knockout blow! Himiko Punch!”
“Both hands filled with crops and joy; all of them for everyone!”
“O’ Guide of the Stars that subjugate the Sun, the Moon and the Heavens, clear away the forever unchanging darkness, and imitate the light that is called Truth; Seishin Katadoru Kyuuenkyou!”
“Himiko, Himiko, Miko, Himiko, Himi Himi Himiko, Miko, Himiko————I saw it! Abundant crops and smiles on everybody’s faces! Seishin Katadoru Kyuuenkyou!”
“Yamatai-koku is indestructible for eternity!!”

### Character Image

The Queen of Yamatai-koku, who was said to have existed in ancient Japan. It was passed around that Himiko deluded and governed the people skillfully by manipulating a Magecraft called Kidou. A queen of many mysteries who was said to have suddenly manifested in an empire that had lasted for a long time and had divided into many smaller domains, before having unified them all into a single country with the power of oracles.

Himiko took up her residence in the depths of a gigantic temple, never revealing herself in public, and her words were transmitted to the people through her nameless younger brother. She had excelled at diplomacy as well; for instance, she sent envoys to the state of Wei in the continent and was granted the title Shingi Wa-ou (Ruler of Wa, Friend of Wei). But after Himiko’s death, Yamatai-koku happened to disappear from the stage of history unexpectedly, ending with the records about Iyo, her disciple. There are still many mysteries about the country called Yamatai-koku, and on top of that, even people are unsure of its location.

Himiko herself says, “You see, since I became Queen, I couldn’t even go outside freely, so honestly, even I don’t know its location well~”

The celestial bodies reveal the abyss, and likewise, the abyss imitates the celestial bodies; they are mirrors facing each other.

On a certain night, “it” was heard by Himiko. It was far away, yet it was nearby. It seemed to be whispering, yet it was loudly ringing. It seemed to be despairing, yet it was cheerfully rejoicing. Her own body is like a body that reveals, and that body reveals what is deep inside her own body. In the end, eternity can be seen over there, and as a result, eternal wisdom is connected to over here.

A primitive person with an ability beyond that of humans was born into this world as innumerable mirrors that face each other in order to project something inhuman, and that person contains a superpower within that body of hers, a power that is too much for any human body.

Himiko gave up her ordinary life as a human, and she devoted that body of hers for the sake of the people’s smiles. She has no regrets about that life, even accepting the darkness that comes in the end… even if in that end, she vanishes over there at that time————

“So, I said I have particularly nothing like a wish to make on the Holy Grail but… I lied! That’s a lie! I do have one! A wish. To be honest, um, as Seihai-kun also knows, during my lifetime, I followed my duty as a Queen, so I didn’t have a chance at all to meet someone that is like my, uh, how do you say it?… Soulmate? Is that what they’re called? Right, so like other people’s love fortune-tellings, I’ve seen them; yeah, I’ve seen them all. Hell, I’ve seen them even when I have no interest in seeing them; the fact is, I’ve reliably told their fortunes right on the mark, to the extent that I’ve said “Yes, yes, I wish for your happiness in your marriage~!”, but when it comes to my love fortune-telling, it’s entirely ‘damena Himiko (no good [for] Himiko), or ‘Damiko’ for short. That’s why I wish to meet a dramatic & exciting soulmate! Please!!”

————In this way, she is definitely Himiko, the Arbitrator of Light as well as Yamatai-koku’s first Queen.

### General Armaments

The fists of Yamatai-koku’s first Queen.
The power of light and a large number of Himiko Techniques that are done with vigour.
Mysterious mirrors.

### Connections with Characters

#### Iyo

Her disciple. Her relationship with Iyo – the second Queen whom Himiko personally selected – is like a relationship between a senior and a junior at a company. During their lifetimes, Iyo is one of the few people who Himiko was able to be close to, to the point that she can reveal her true colours to her. Himiko nominates Iyo as her successor, but after her own death, Yamatai-koku happened to disappear from the stage of history unexpectedly.

#### The Nameless Turtle

Himiko’s younger brother whose name did not become known. He continued to support Himiko, who became the Queen of Yamatai-koku, openly and secretly.

#### Kukochihiko

The King of Kuna-koku, a country that fought against Yamatai-koku. Kukochihiko has a deep predestined relationship with Himiko. That is because Yamatai-koku triumphed in its conflict with Kuna-koku due to Himiko’s powers.

#### Sima Yi Zhongda

“I sent envoys to the State of Wei and received various things such as mirrors and some other stuff. But you know, I heard that it completely fell afterwards; the State of Wei that Sima Yi-chan lived in.”

#### Beni-enma

“I’m greatly thankful to you because you took the trouble to prepare delicious meals for me. My favourite in particular is the clam miso soup.”

#### The Shinsengumi

“For that reason, there has been a close connection between the Shinsengumi and Yamatai-koku since super-ancient times, you understand?…“

#### Haniwa Nobbu

“What the hell is… THAT, really? Er, the Caribbean Sea? Well, um, are you saying something like… I failed to purify that thing?…”
