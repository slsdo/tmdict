### Magical Resistance: A

Cancels out all Magecraft spells that are at the Ranks of A and below. In fact, modern mages would not be able to wound Himiko with their Magecraft.

### Territory Creation: A

As a Mage, one can create an advantageous position for themselves.
It is possible for Himiko to mold a “Temple”, which is superior to a “Workshop”.
After Himiko became Queen, her figure was rarely seen in public, but it seems that she had occasionally slipped out from her temple in secret.

### Primitive Body: A

A Skill that denotes a super-naturally healthy body that is in sound health and does not have any wounds.
Himiko is truly a fine young woman with a perfect health that is overflowing with a vitality primitive humans had possessed.
Incidentally, if Himiko is lazy, her body will gradually feel dull, and if she eats too much, her figure will gradually change. Her body is natural in that sense too.

“When you’re in Chaldea, you happen to unconsciously overeat; isn’t that right?~”
