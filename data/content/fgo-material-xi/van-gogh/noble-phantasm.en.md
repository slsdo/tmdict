The Starry Night.
A wondrous painting depicting the view from his asylum at Saint-Paul de Mausole. The worldview, beyond human knowledge, overflows from the painting, forming an individual boundary, and corroding reality.
Those who open their eyes within the boundary succumb to the destruction of their mind. Those who can understand the higher beings from the outer realms have their mental connections widened and enter a divergent strengthening state referred to as “deification”.
This “deification” state can be made to be temporary, but if control is lost, it becomes an irreversible alteration. In this case, the target is removed from the “servant” system.
In Gogh’s later years, even as he struggled with inexplicable mental episodes, he wielded his paintbrush in search of religious faith and goodness.
This persistence, bordering on madness, was used by the Outer Entities to create a forbidden Noble Phantasm that alters and “deifies” the spirit origins and mental structure of others.

The Yellow House.
An artistic recreation of Gogh’s home in Arles, Southern France, which became the turning point in his talent blossoming, but also the stage for the ruination of his dreams.
To his enemies, it brings harm by becoming the cold wind that plagues Southern France, the mistral. To the allies inside the Yellow House = boundary, it grants them generous protections.
However, since the Yellow House gradually fills with discord and curses, continuous usage will lead to strife within the group. As such, usage must be balanced with sufficient caution.
