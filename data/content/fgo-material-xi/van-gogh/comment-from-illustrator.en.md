So I was told to make a “slightly creepy but cute girl with a dependent, self-deprecating personality” and I was like, what, I love every part of that. So I put my will into it… or more like, all of my soul into it, and that’s how I approached the design. It was a lot of fun. Even while keeping to the “sickly flower” concept, I made it so as you go progress from 1st to 2nd to 3rd ascensions it went from a flower you might be familiar with, to a more alien flower (or at least, I hope I did…). I also thought on how to really incorporate “complementary colors”, something the painter van Gogh was known for, so the design proposal was about to be a huge chaotic mess. But! Takeuchi-sensei and the writer amphibian-sensei managed to get it all organized really well. I really can’t thank them enough. (kibadori-rue)
