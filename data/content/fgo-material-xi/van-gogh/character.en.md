### Personality

She’s always laughing - “ufufu”, “ehehe”. However, the feelings contained can range from fawning, self-deprecation, nervous laughter, gloating or chuckling over her plans or fantasies, etc.
Somewhat bipolar, she gets worked up, goes off to do something, fails, and gets mired in regret and self-condemnation. An adorable little girl but one who makes you worried for her.
While devoted, she also has a facet where she is honest to herself (desires), and another where she is skilled at plotting.
She is extremely deprecating of herself for these features, but at the same time, she has sky-high pride in her skills in drawing and as an artist, second to none.
If you take her humble or self-deprecating words about her works at face value and disparage her works, however, there is a possibility that the relationship becomes severely antagonistic, and so care must be taken. As a “patchwork”, her own self-identity has some serious issues. See later.

### Attitude towards Master

She feels that her raison d’etre is in devoting herself to Master and friends, and therefore acts like a servant. She follows any order with an obsequious servility, but if given the opportunity to draw she is particularly happy. However, she is incapable of comprehending any questions or commands digging into her identity, and she either ignores them or engages in escapism. If this is continued, she slowly accumulates madness within her. Regardless of her mental state, she is a big eater, and uses copious amounts of drawing materials. Since she is a spendthrift both in magic and finances, caution must be taken.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant: Foreigner. As you can see, I’m Gogh. Let’s paint this world anew…. j-just kidding, ufufu, ehehe.”
“When I’m working like this, I can remember Goupil & Cie,… intelligent Gogh,… Gogh who can succeed when putting her mind to it,… Gogh whose shit attitude gets her fired…. ufufu, I want to die! Save me, Theo!”
“Yuyu-sama is going yu-yu… ufufu… just a Goghk!” (Yu-yu is Japanese for “slowly”, “measured”, “composed”, etc. ’tis a pun. Wouldn’t have worked if translated there though…)
“Gogh is… I am, ingenious….? Ehehe… ehehe… ehehe… no,… no, no… I’m nothing like that…. I just, am good at entrapping people.”
“And so, adieu, with a firm handshak-, er, whuh, I can’t, can’t get the tentacles out…. ah ah ah, nooooooo…. -!?” (TL note: See “Historical Figure” if you’re confused about the handshake.)

### Historical Image · Character Image

Vincent Willem van Gogh was an 19th century Dutch artist. “van” is not a middle name, but a surname, “van Gogh”. In his brief decade-long career as an artist, he left a large number of artworks, and become one of the most famous artists of modern times. However, he would fail to garner much acclaim during his lifetime, barely getting by with assistance from his brother Theodoreus (nickname Theo), who worked as an art dealer. However, his mental health would deteriorate over time, eventually dying of suicide.
There are many stories of him that give the impression of excessive enthusiasm or attachment, starting with the time he cut off his left ear and gave it to Gauguin. This has led to him being called the “The Burning Artist1” and the “Genius of Madness2”. However, in his many letters to his friends (and especially Theo), one can see a glimpse of a very human personality, of a Gogh with worries about love or finances, or indulging in literature or entertainment, or his joys and sadness over the ups and downs in life.
The phrase “with a handshake” comes from the phrase he often used to close his letters.

Clytie is a nymph (a spirit/lesser god in the form of a beautiful girl, found in mountains, rivers, trees, etc.) as described in Greek mythology.
She is one of the 3,000 beautiful Oceanid water nymphs, daughter of the sea god Oceanus, and Tethys. Driven mad by jealousy when the sun god’s love went to the princess Leucothoe, the daughter of the Persian king, Clytie slandered Leucothoe, leading to Leucothoe’s destruction.
However, this failed to win back the sun god’s love, and holding her one-sided love within her heart until the end, she ended up turning herself into a single flower.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Art, at times, reaches a territory beyond the logic of the human world, or in other words, human reasoning. Even with the artist Gogh’s many exceptional artworks, there are a few that have reached this level. The one who first laid eyes upon these artworks as they lay stored within Theo’s warehouse was not another art dealer, critic, or even a dilettante. Instead, it was an sentient entity far divergent from human reasoning from the Outer Realms - or at least, the “flower” that was born within the artist referred to itself as so. At this point, perhaps there was nothing to show that this “sentient entity from the Outer Realms” actually existed, and was perhaps nothing more than a fantasy of the artist, or a figment of madness.
Anyway, the “flower” attempted to compel obedience from the painter by promising rewards or by threats, but the artist never succumbed. After the completion of over 2000 works of art and one bullet, the artist had won out over the madness.
--however, his enemy was not so docile or so kind as to accept death as the final word.

The foreigner van Gogh is an illegal spirit origin brought into existence in Void Space somehow by the entity that forms the “Evil Flower God”. Its identity is a patchwork Heroic Spirit comprising Clytie from Greek mythos, the painter Gogh’s memories and artistic talent, and various things such as compatibility with Void Space and the vanguard of the evil god itself.
The composition of the spirit origin is as follows:
-80% Clytie’s body and mind
-5% Painter Gogh’s memories and artistic skills
-15% “Black box” of Void Space things
Only a small portion of Clytie is contained, but she is still a true god. As such, the volume of “the memories and skills of a human who died young” ends up being relatively small.

Even if there are some similarities between the personality and ways of life of Clytie and Gogh, forcing two entities of different species, origins, and personalities into a single “patchwork” is bound to have issues. In this case, the problems manifest as Gogh’s mental instability, and as a result she now constantly struggles with the question of “what am I”… an identity crisis.
Due to the “Curse of the Sunflower” borne of Clytie, Gogh is forbidden from suicide. When the unavoidable madness caused by her identity crisis reaches a certain threshold, there are only two paths she can take: either to succumb to the evil god, releasing the Noble Phantasm “De Sterrennacht” and to bring forth the advent of the evil god and the madness of the Outer Realms. Alternately, she could “blossom” and transform into the evil god herself. In either case, this is a threat that could instantly end Humanity.
Normally, this Heroic Spirit would never be summonable. However, were a summon to happen, the main key to avoiding danger would be how stable the identity given to her would be. Under no circumstance should a Command Spell be used to compel suicide.
Based on the resultant self-identity reached, the true name, personality, and stats will change. In some sense, she could be said to be a rare Heroic Spirit that is able to “grow”.

She likes puns, and the self-deprecation, pessimism, and one-liners are all referred to as “Goghk”s, which she says often. This is rooted in things like the literary mindset that can be seen in the painter Gogh’s letters, or the awkward sense of humor that has her enjoying repeating the words of strong rejection from the person they loved, and the charm of Clytie who at one point was surely loved by the sun god. It’s like breathing, so it’s fine to just nod and smile, and let it pass.

### General Armaments

A giant paintbrush in the design of a sunflower.
This paintbrush can freely change size and shape thanks to “Void Space Arts”, and it can be used to toy with enemies by taking at times shapes like that of a large firearm, or a huge chainsaw.
There’s been rumours that the “paintbrush talked”.
After Heroic Spirit Ascension, the main form of attack becomes freely appearing “tentacle-like somethings” based on use of “Void Space Arts”.

### Connections with Characters

#### Nemo

The one who saved Gogh from an identity crisis during the “Imaginary Scramble” that because a Void Space phenomenon. Even without that, based on the similarities in being Phantom Spirits, roots in recent Europe and Greece, and an extremely strong blessing of the sea, a person with whom Gogh can feel close to based on many points in common.

#### Katsushika Hokusai

The artist Gogh was enamored of ukio-e in their previous life, and the reason why he had an admiration for the “country without shadows”.
An artist worth respecting, and a worthy rival with whom Gogh can compete as an equal… or at least, that’s what Gogh thinks one-sidedly.

#### Yang Gufei

Someone Gogh came to be involved with during the Void Space phenomenon “Imaginary Scramble”.
I3 want us to work together and help each other overcome the many dangers that are involved from beginning to end in being a Foreigner spirit origin. Even if you don’t remember. Even if you don’t even understand.

#### Frankenstein

As a fellow “patchwork monster”, someone with whom Gogh can speak without nervousness.

#### Martha

A person whom Gogh had made a subject of their art in their previous life.
For Gogh, who respects the beauty of labor, she who embodies the (fist-based) “active lifestyle” is a subject of high regard.

#### Paris

A person accompanied by Apollo, the one whom the water spirit Clytie loved in her previous life. Gogh personally doesn’t realy have any memories matching this, but after becoming self-aware of being Clytie, she is vaguely aware of it, and sometimes feels as if her heart aches.
