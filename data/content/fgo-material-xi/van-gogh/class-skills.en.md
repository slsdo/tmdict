### Existence Outside the Domain: A

One who has descended from the outer realms, the Imaginary Void.
Possessed by an evil god, she houses and wields a portent of the god’s authority.

### Insanity: C

Uncertainty and terror. Deviation from harmony and the laws of nature.
An abnormal thought process that goes as far as to affect the Weltanschauung of surrounding psyches.

### Item Construction: B-

Thanks to her unique and exceptional artistic talent, she can quickly create works of art that affect the minds of viewers. However, the efficiency and quality of these works varies greatly by her state of mind.

### Divinity: B+

Her divinity as a vanguard of the higher beings that dwell within the outer realms is rather low, but the water spirit whose form she is based on is a direct descendant of the sea god. As such, overall, she has inherited a high divinity. When an identity close to the water spirit is chosen, her divinity increases.

### Curse of the Sunflower: A

A unique skill born from the story of the water spirit on whom she is based.
She can never commit suicide, with “blooming” instead replacing suicide.
Normally this is contained to the extent that some parts of her body are altered in shape, but in serious cases she may metamorphose into the very “Evil Flower God” of her own design.
