### Void Space Arts: B+

A skill born of the fusion of the features as a “patchwork” servant of Void Space and the art skills of the artist Gogh. This allows for magical phenomena to occur despite modern artists normally being unrelated to magic or divinity. A similar but distinct unique skill line from Void Magic, truly understanding the depths of the skill and exercising it is a feat only possible for her.

### Soul of the Water Channels: EX

A skill born from the resonance of the “madness of devoting everything” between the souls of the “patchwork” artist and fairy. One unit of her choosing can receive “the blessing they want most at that moment”. At its essence, the skill is based on “devotion, teaching, and leading”, but since the method chosen is by “taking the burden of pain, curses, and various undesirable things”, the result of taking it to excess would be nothing other than suicide.
