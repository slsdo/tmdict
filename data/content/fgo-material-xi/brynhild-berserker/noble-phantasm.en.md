Brynhildr Sigurutein
The Heroic Brynhildr temporarily materializes・summons a massive blue transparent sword which Sigurd will horizontally swing to slaughter their enemies. It is a momentary combination attack / a Combination Noble Phantasm.

Brynhildr can only summon the sword but cannot swing it, while Sigurd can only swing it but cannot summon it. This large summoned sword is a divine sword that the Almighty God Odin bestowed to the old War God Tyr, thus Brynhildr used her Primeval Rune to imitate the effects to have her “Sword with Double Carved Runes of Victory”. While it is an imitation, it possesses enough power to be a divine weapon.
