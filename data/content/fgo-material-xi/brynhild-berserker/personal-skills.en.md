### Swan Mystic Code (Summer): A+

It is her white bikini.
Nay. This is indeed her Swan Mystic Code, the clothes of a battle maiden that conquered the skies that she appropriately changed into at the midsummer lake shore. It also has the ability to fly.

### Midsummer Wisdom: B

With the crystallized wisdom of the Gods, she almost knows everything about summer. A pair of glasses she created with Sigurd.

### Summertime Lovers: EX

“I have to kill my beloved—Sigurd.”
Summer Brynhildr has chosen not to back away from her roots as a Heroic Spirit who brings instantaneous disaster… Namely, she acts like an innocent and oblivious woman, and having fun dates with Sigurd “until night falls”. This is a special skill that she applied via her Primordial Runes.
