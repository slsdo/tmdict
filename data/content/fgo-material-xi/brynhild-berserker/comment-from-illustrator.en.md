My long desired swimsuit! I’ve taken the liberty of drawing a lot of different facial expressions so that you can enjoy her Servant life to the fullest after her original tragic life. The first ascension was designed around Brynhildr’s original image I had for her. Her glasses were most likely chosen for her by her husband.
Her second ascension is a mature black summer dress, and her third ascension is clearly a wedding dress. It was already decided that she was a Berserker when the order was placed, so it was kind of on me to equip her with a chainsaw. I think.
The roses on her eventually grow into a bouquet as she ascends. Her massive sword Noble Phantasm that comes in the form of an inverted wing was supposed to originally be handled by Brynhildr, but they went in the direction of a “two people combination attack” with Brynhildr summoning the sword, and Sigurd swinging it.
The cut-in that appears randomly was requested to be drawn at the last minute when the idea of a combination attack was presented to me. I hoped that the “combination attack” would be done within the event scenario, but I still feel overly delighted that it’s been implemented in the battle sequence.
The great sword seems to originate from the War God Tyr, and I put in some runic characters that reference him. On the card’s background, I drew some white birds that represent the Valkyrie Sisters, and two black birds that may or may not be Odin’s servants, Huginn and Muninn. The giant swords that are etched into the Earth depict Ragnarok that’s lapsed away, and the latticework behind her third ascension depict an open birdcage. (Miwa Shirow)
