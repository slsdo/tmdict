### Mad Enhancement: D-

Since her Saint Graph has been altered into a Berserker, her assigned Mad Enhancement skill rank is low. She is able to communicate normally.

### Divinity: E

She once had high aptitude as a Divine Spirit, but now it is extremely low. While she was once a battle maiden of the Valkyries and daughter of the great God Odin, her divinity was stripped away by Odin himself.
