### Personality

She is similar to the usual Brynhildr (Lancer). Calm and devoted.
However, unlike her usual self, she is completely open about her love for her beloved Sigurd. She is not afraid to celebrate her love and enjoy her vacation at the midsummer lake shore.
She will never say phrases such as “I have to kill you” or “I’m going to kill you”.
It’s as if this Saint Graph of hers completely sealed her automatic murderous intent towards her “beloved (Sigurd)”, however—----

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Similar to the usual Brynhildr (Lancer).

### Dialogue Examples

Happy Lover Mode:
“Please take a look at this. These little birds are having so much fun at the center of the lake…”
“Let’s go, Sigurd”
“Would you like to join me, Master? No, no, please be my guest.”
“Shall we row a boat!?”

Tragic Bloodthirsty Killer Mode
“Aaa…..aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa….! Why….!?”
“Sigurd, Sigurd, Sigurd, Sigurd….!”
“Sigurd?” (Sigurd who’s covered in blood)
“Ah, I’m relieved…I’m so relieved…so you were there all along…Sigurd…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Completely identical to Brynhildr (Lancer).

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A tragic battle maiden who’s immersed in her own transient happiness.

When she visits the midsummer lakeside, she uses her Primordial Rune to forcibly alter her Saint Graph. She is calm, innocent and in a passionate relationship with the great hero Sigurd, which makes it sounds like the instability of her harmonious usual Saint Graph was all a lie, but…

At night, screams echo everywhere. Sigurd is submerged in a sea of blood. And Brynhildr is covered in his blood. What in the world exactly happened here….!?

The adamant Sigurd never speaks about the culprit’s existence (as he stands back up multiple times). Brynhildr panics for her life. And in her hand is her bloodstained new Noble Phantasm. What in the world exactly happened here….!?

Let’s unravel the truth.

Here’s the truth. Due to her forcibly adjusted Saint Graph by overlapping it with her Primordial Rune, she can harmoniously go through the daytime, but when it becomes night time, her murderous intent from her normal Saint Graph increasingly swells up within her and Brynhildr has to kill her beloved Sigurd. Sigurd has impressively accepted this every night.

Originally, Brynhildr normally thought that “I want to go through the day without having to be tempted to kill him for several days” and Sigurd suggested this Saint Graph, but ultimately, she had been met with fears that she would go berserk momentarily if she repeatedly interacted with Sigurd causing her murderous intent (love) to swell up. This fear stopped due to Master and Sigurd’s great efforts, but….. As expected, two lovers can’t cuddle close to each other for all eternity. This temporary Saint Graph is only for the summer.

“Your Saint Graph is beautiful, but, you will always be gorgeous to me as you are”

Sigurd had to tell her that it was the end of summer. Brynhildr smiled. As she smiled, she wept.

### General Armaments

Her sword which transformed from her massive sword, her Noble Phantasm.
A chainsaw-like blade with countless miniscule blades that spins at high speeds and looks awfully painful.
(It only changes into a gigantic sword only when Sigurd is wielding it as well)

### Connections with Characters

#### Sigurd

I love you! Yes. My dear beloved, Sigurd. And, I’m sorry…

#### Valkyries

What’s the matter? Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something wrong with me? Maybe it could be that I look different than usual… Or maybe it could be that my beloved Sigurd is coming along.

#### Altera

Sister Alteri!
Yes, yes.
You’ll be watching over me, right, sister.

#### Siegfried / Kriemhild

That’s right.
You both should dress up for the summer, let’s do it! The Heroic Spirit Siegfried already has an outfit…so it’s just you.
Kriemhild. No, you must.
Fufu, I’m not letting you get away.

#### Arthur

Good morning, Saber. Today, you are kind as well. Ufufu, it’s alright, this time around, I won’t be…troubled.

#### Arash

I look pretty, you say? Fufu, thank you very much.
…Yes? But, don’t be so reckless out there—
You’re always perceptive, aren’t you? Ah. Such kind heroes.
