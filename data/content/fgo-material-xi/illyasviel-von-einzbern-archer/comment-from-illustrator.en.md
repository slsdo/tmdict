With the theme of Summer + Archer I knew I had to get fired up and think of something, but it felt like I had already run out of ideas! So after much thought I came up with the hose reel.
Ruby’s mood has been steadily getting worse yet she has become more and more popular.
The mysterious cat headdress is made out of toweling not fur.
The initial idea for her second ascension was a graceful style called "wrap towel" but for some reason the boss didn’t approve of it. Damn!
I think I overdid it with the facial expressions, but I drew the faces that I thought were necessary for Ilya’s role in the story, and this is what I came up with. I am grateful that they were able to be used effectively. (Hiroshi Hiroyama)
