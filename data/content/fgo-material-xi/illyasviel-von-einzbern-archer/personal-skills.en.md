### High Pressure!: A

A skill that increases the water pressure and discharge from the hose. As a side note, even though it’s called water, it’s actually a sort of magical energy that Ruby converted to make it look summery, and what comes out of that nozzle may differ from time to time.

### Summer Vacation! (Child): A+

Elementary school children are powerful, almost invincible during the summer. (They think) they can do anything, and (they think) they have all the time in the world. They start to weaken around the end of August

### Legal Shower!: B++

Loaded with Ruby’s meticulously-made herb extract (deadly poison). They are not only effective on contact, but they are also potent if inhaled.
“Its sophisticated toxicity is not only harmless to Illya, but it has the added bonus of actually raising her concentration!”
Its effects are so potent that even the hydra would recoil, but parents should rest assured that they’re completely harmless to their children.
