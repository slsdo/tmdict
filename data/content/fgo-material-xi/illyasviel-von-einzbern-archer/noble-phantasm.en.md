Prisma☆Splash Rainbow!
Fifth grade summer vacation…a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. …Or so it should have been. But after having to repeat the so-called invaluable summer for numerous years, Illya finally realizes the true meaning of summer vacation.

Everything comes to an end. The moment something starts, the countdown to its end begins as well. Treasures obtained, the emotions that come with them, and even precious memories are bound to disappear one day. But even if you try stopping the clock out of fear of losing things, the treasures will lose their luster. And that’s why we cannot stop. We need to continue toward the future even as things come to an end. The ancient treasures become constellations, and the paths we walked become a rainbow that paints the skies…
This is the important life lesson she came to learn…though honestly, that kind of awareness should be saved for serious main stories… Either way, Illya converts all these summer memories and bonds into power to transform into “Prisma☆Illya Splash Rainbow!” Her resolve to end summer vacation calls forth another Illya from a different time, and a light bullet that’s seven times more dense than normal time density fires at anything stagnant.
And she’ll try her best again during the new school term.
