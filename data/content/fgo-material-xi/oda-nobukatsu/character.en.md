### Personality

He usually acts as an upstanding young man, but when he develops a relationship with someone, he tends to be a bit more approachable. His skills and talent as a military commander are actually quite impressive, but due to his sister being just too abnormal in that regard, he was never able to evaluate himself correctly.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He tentatively shows respect to them since they are also his sister’s Master, but should his sister become an enemy of the Master, he would probably not hesitate to stab them in the back.

### Dialogue Examples

“Whaaa!? Sister!?”
“Awawa… Why is my sister here!?”
“Yeah, naturally！Nobukatsu will always side with his sister!”
“I couldn’t allow my sister to go unrecognized because of some absurd reason like being a woman. That’s why I had to get her all fired up!”
“After all, I was just incompetent!”
“―――I’ll leave the rest to you, sister”

### Character Image

The younger brother of Oda Nobunaga, the famed warlord of the Sengoku period.
History says little about him, save that he was Oda Nobunaga’s younger brother, and so his Saint Graph is frail and weak.
Normally, he would never have been summonable as a Heroic Spirit, but for certain reasons, he managed to acquire a Saint Graph which allows him to manifest.

Unlike Nobunaga, who was nicknamed the Fool of Owari, Nobukatsu was known to be intelligent even in his youth, and his mother, Dota Gozen, adored him. It was believed that he would be the next head of the Oda family. Nobukatsu eventually came to believe that he was the true heir of the Oda family, so he rallied retainers who were loyal to him and rebelled against Nobunaga. However his twice-attempted rebellions both ended in failure, and Nobunaga eventually killed Nobukatsu.

He is Nobunaga’s younger brother, nothing more and nothing less than that. That is the entirety of Oda Nobukatsu’s existence.

He considered his sister to be his everything, and he grew to hate the world of the Sengoku period which rejected her. Eventually he deviced an insane plan to get rid of everyone in the Oda house who would become an obstacle for his sister, fully knowing that it would end with him being purged as well.

My sister is amazing! She taught me about warfare that someone like me couldn’t even imagine about! Occasionally, my father and sister would argue, but even father is no match to my sister! Indeed! If someone like her is to succeed the Oda clan, there’s no need to worry about neither my nor the people of Owari’s future! No matter how many powerful countries surround us, there is no opponent who comes anywhere close to my wonderful sister! My sister who always helps me, my sister who always guides me, my sister who is always dignified and beautiful, my sister who sometimes smiles at me… Indeed, how very wonderful this world is with my sister! To a sister like that, I must be nothing more than a worthless nuisance. Why don’t everyone understand this? Indeed, that must be it: these guys are all idiots. I know that I myself am a fool, but these guys are too stupid to even comprehend the wonderfulness of my sister. And that I was born this way must be piling it on more. How could I possibly hope to live as the brother of such a wonderful sister? Right, I know how it is. I can’t allow myself to remain a chain on my sister’s legs any more. Yes, I, more than anyone else, cannot forgive myself. I cannot forgive myself for being your brother!

―――Sister, thank you so much!

This is just a hypothesis, but had the Oda siblings been born not as feudal lords, but as regular civilians, maybe they could have lived their lives and future harmoniously as brother and sister.

By the way during this summoning, maybe because of some remaining fragment of Nobunaga’s Saint Graph or something, Nobukatsu is able to summon those ‘mysterious little things’ to aid him. According to Nobukatsu they have received some minor renewals, so you might be able to kill some time if you compare them to the older ones to see what’s different.

### Connections with Characters

#### Oda Nobunaga

I always wanted to live happily with my sister.

#### Okita Souji

You’re not getting chummy with my sister, right? I can’t have it seem like you’re closer to my sister than I am!!

#### Chacha

While it’s true she has my sister’s looks, she’s not even in the league. What’s up with that?

#### Toyotomi Hideyoshi

Who is that? Huh? That general my sister had her eye on!? N-no way…! I mean, if he’s helping my sister I don’t mind, but… I still don’t like it!

#### Shibata Katsuie

He was recognized as having outstanding ability even amongst the commanders of the Oda clan, so he was chosen to become a retainer to help my sister.

#### Mori Nagayoshi

If he is really the son of Yoshinari, that poor excuse for control is understandable. I still won’t take him disobeying my sister, though!

#### Mori Ranmaru

You were my sister’s favorite page!? I-I’m jealous…

#### Nameless Turtle

A nameless Heroic Spirit with whom, due to a certain fate, his Saint Graph became one in a faraway, distant time. While they both possessed Saint Graphs too weak to become Servants, they were both people who would give their all for their sisters, in their own way.
