### Artless Stratagem: D

Nobukatsu carried out two acts of rebellion in his life.
He gathered all the dissatisfied members of his house and failed in his rebellion both times, but all of this was just to lay the foundation for that person to become the Demon King.

### For the Demonic Heaven, I Die a Martyr: B

His fanatical devotion that leads him to offer his life in order to turn his sister into the Demon King. Whether Nobukatsu’s way of life ushered his sister forward on the path of the Demon King, or his sister being Demon King determined Nobukatsu’s way of life, only the two of them will ever really know.

### War-Torn Flower: C

Nobukatsu was like a non-fruit-bearing flower of the times; one that produced nothing even after blooming.
Whether his life was meaningless or not, only his sister Nobunaga would know.
