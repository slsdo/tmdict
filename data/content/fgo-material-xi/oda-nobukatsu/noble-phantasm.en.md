Maoukaiten・Higanbana.
A suicidal Noble Phantasm that strengthens the target in exchange for one’s own termination. The sole Noble Phantasm allowed to Nobukatsu, who through his death allowed his sister to walk not the path of a human, but a Demon King.

Normally, this Noble Phantasm would annihilate his entire Saint Graph, but due to his assimilation with a certain nameless Saint Graph, he is able to maintain his body.

It is said that nameless Saint Graph was also a younger brother who wished to save his older sister.

“That’s right, brothers and sisters are supposed to help each other out.”
