### Magic Resistance: D

Nullifies the usage of one-step (single action) magecraft.
A resistance roughly on par with a Magic Resistance amulet.

### Independent Action: C

The ability to independently remain for some time, even should magical energy supply from the Master be cut off.
At C-rank, it is possible to remain manifested for one day after losing his Master.
Were he to lose his older sister, it would probably be impossible to remain manifested more than a few seconds.
