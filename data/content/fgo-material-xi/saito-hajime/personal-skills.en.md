### Invincible Sword: A

A term that described Saito’s remarkable swordsmanship, which was said to be one of the best in the Shinsengumi. The style of swordsmanship Saito practiced is unknown and was said to be either Mugai-ryu or Itto-ryu, but in truth it was a free-spirited style that couldn’t be understood by opponents. Honestly, he is just swinging his sword around

### Freely Drawn Sword: B

A sword drawing technique that can freely change forms when the user unsheathes his blade in each hand. A swordsmanship independent of form, changing in all directions from the tip of the sword. It’s a specialized combat technique that makes it extremely difficult to predict where his strike will fall.

“My dominant hand? I just use whatever hand is easier at the time. Besides, if you got time to be worrying about things like that, just start cutting already.”
