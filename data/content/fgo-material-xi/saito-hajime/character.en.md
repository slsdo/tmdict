### Personality

A man with two faces: A guy with a laid-back vibe that lives up to the Shinsengumi name and a sharp eyed keen individual. Saito Hajime is not the kind of person to put on act so you can be sure both faces are true.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The type that doesn’t get too close, and doesn’t push too far.
However, once he recognizes someone as his master, he will never abandon them, and will act with the master’s survival as the first priority in any predicament.

### Dialogue Examples

I’m Saito Hajime. Call me Hajime if you want to get all friendly with me. Then again, better not.
School of discipline? Doesn’t matter to me. Then again, as I am now, I might call it the peerless style.
Vice-Commander, you still… No, that’s right. That’s fine. You can stick to your “sincerity”. I’ll walk my “sincerity”.
Without form, my sword is intangible. As it flows, it embodies all possibilities… That is why my sword has no equal!

### Character Image

Saito Hajime, the third unit captain of the Shinsengumi, a police force that served in Kyoto at the end of the shogunate.

He was one of the best swordsmen in the Shinsengumi, on par with Okita Souji and Nagakura Shinpachi, but his origins and the school of his swordsmanship are unknown.

One of the few members of the Shinsengumi who fought and survived through the turbulent period of the Bakumatsu until the start of the Meiji period, and lived out his life.

His swords skills were prominent among the Shinsengumi, and the Second Unit captain Nagakura Shinpachi dubbed Okita Souji the Stalwart Sword and Saito Hajime the Invincible Sword. He was said to have undertaken many undercover missions, such as purges within the units, and one theory even states that he was a spy sent into the Shinsengumi from the Shogunate or Aizu clan.

In fact, his behavior during his time in the Shinsengumi was often suspicious, and he seems to have held a sort of special position among the ranks.

He may appear to be a lovable goof at first glance, but he at times shows much shrewder, more serious side. That said, he believed in living a flexible and adaptable life not influenced by existing values, despite being a member of the Shinsengumi, which tended to hold to traditional values.

“That sounds real good on paper, but in reality all I do is stick around as long as things seem fun.”

As you can see from what he says above, he’s kind of a jokester, so Okita gave him the unfortunate nickname Snarksengumi.

He loves noodles, and after eating croquette soba when he manifested in the modern world, it quickly became his favorite.

“Dipping croquette in soba is such an unpretentious, yet delicious dish. It’s the best.”

A member of the Shinsengumi since its inception, he won Commander Kondo and Vice Commander Hijikata’s trust, carried out numerous important missions, and survived many intense battles during his tenure. He later left the Shinsengumi and joined the newly formed government, living out the rest of his life into old age. Towards the end of his life, he was a man of few words, and seldom spoke about his days in the Shinsengumi. He often worked as a spy more than as a swordsman, and his solitary lifestyle where he seldom revealed his true intentions often led both his enemies and allies to see him as a man lacking a warrior’s conviction.

“Well, there’s some truth to all that. I kind of stumbled around from one place to another, just following my own interests. I always say that you lose when you die. If you don’t die, that means you don’t lose. That’s the secret to my invincible sword. Or whatever.”

But who really knows the truth of his actions. After all, he lived through the new era carrying a single flag—his own principle—in his heart until the very last moment of his life.

### Connections with Characters

#### Okita Souji

Oh hey, Okita. You’ve been well? Heh. Guess not. You’ve always been a sickly one. Well either way, I’m glad we’re on the same team. I’d rather not fight you ever again.

#### Hijikata Shozo

Officially, he kept his distance, but among the members, he was the most trusted by Hijikata, and undertook many behind-the-scenes missions for the Shinsengumi. Due to the passage of time, they parted company, but the trust of Hijikata, the vice-captain, is absolute even after time has passed.

#### Keisuke Yamanami

A serious and kind person among the Shinsengumi. At first glance, they don’t seem to get along well, but during their lifetime they were strangely compatible and often ended up on the same missions. He describes Yamanami as being clumsy but which one of them was really clumsy is anyone’s guess.

#### Shinpachi Nagakura

On fairly bad terms as a matter of fact. Saito basically keeps a moderate distance from all the members, except for Nagakura.

#### Serizawa Kamo

Their relationship wasn’t particularly good or bad. In his life, he often hung out with Okita. Saito was meant to keep an eye on him, but Okita gained his trust naturally. I really wonder about that, Okita.

#### Sakamoto Ryōma

By the way, i didn’t kill Sakamoto.

#### Okada Izō

Izo the man-slayer… I have to admit that his swordsmanship is impressive, but his social skills need some work.
