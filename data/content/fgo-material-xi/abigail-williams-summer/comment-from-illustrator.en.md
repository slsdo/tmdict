With this design I tried to do something like “something human-like clad in a veil of human form”. I designed the buns in Abby-chan’s hair as heads wearing veils, to give more of a “what am I even looking at?” feeling to her overall appearance. Her staffs are the hinges to a gate. The butterfly connection was already a common thing for her. The jacket shown in her third Ascension is actually a different one from the Jersey jacket she wore in her traveling outfit. I was happy to see that gag made it into Omori Aoi’s manga adaptation, as well. (Kuroboshi Kouhaku)
