### Personality

Fundamentally, she is no different from the regular Abigail.
However, in her summer variant, each Ascension does have their own little uniqueness to them.
While they essentially have the same Saint Graph and traits, their personalities and preferences are complex and multifariously different depending on her Ascension stage.

#### First Ascension

If we were to liken these three Ascensions to sisters, this is the eldest sister. Contrary to her terrifying appearance, she is quite personable with Master. Sometimes can be heard speaking with surprising maturity, which perhaps makes her seem to be the one with the most common sense?
Her tone of voice is indifferent, dignified, and mysterious.

#### Second Ascension

The middle sister. She is straitlaced and closest to the young Puritan Abigail. She is very curious and studious. She is also meticulous and put-together.
Her tone of voice is that of someone trying to make herself appear more adult, yet coming across quite bashful.

#### Third Ascension

The youngest of the three sisters. She’s somewhat immature, yet innocent. Because of her purity, the madness close at hand. This is a new side of Abigail that we have never seen before, which was likely the result of the effects of summer’s many temptations.
Her tone of voice gives off an innocent and childish aura.

### Attitude towards Master

She wants to use her dream powers to heal both her Master and other people. She mostly considers it a tedious matter to differentiate between dream and reality.
Thus, she wants to replace the merciless and false “reality” with the true (as Abigail believes) “dream”. After all, the dreamworld is the history nurtured within mankind’s hearts.
And yet, one of the humble wishes the young girl has is to spend a quiet and peaceful summer vacation alone with Master…

### Dialogue Examples

“Know of my gate. Thy wish to close it will not be granted”
“Iä! Idh-yahaa Fhtag’n”
“In my womb is the silver key”
“Come, from the garden of impurity!”
“Now comes the time of the celestial bodies”
“Did the cats make up…?”
“Now! Nosh! Luthar!”
“Swimsuits are such a great thing! They really make you consider that we’re constantly just dressed in a thin sheet of common sense, and we’re actually naked all the time, right?”
“Ugh…Master is Grand Dumbass!”
“Please, don’t go away, and don’t change, Master. With your frail heart, and your passionate eyes; please don’t become like me.” “Seventy…seven hundred stairs of dreams. Descend them to find a dream realm. It is the evil city of calamity, the frigid hidden wilderness, and it is the unknown summit of the aboriginal god! Come, break the taboo, pass into infinity. Dreamlands!”
“Girls of a certain age are like pupae that have yet to settle on an ethos for themselves. I do hope you will accept me, who constantly changes like the eyes of a cat.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

In the late seventeenth century, when Massachusetts was under British rule, the then-twelve-year-old Puritan girl named Abigail Williams became a central figure in the gruesome Salem Witch Trials, in which numerous villagers were accused of witchcraft and lost their lives at the gallows.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

When Abigail was summoned as a Servant, various factors intervened, and she successfully made a connection with an evil god whose existence has yet to be proven in this universe: the All-in-One and One-in-All. And so, as a faithful vessel of the outer god and calling herself the “Gate of Dreams,” the girl is a Foreigner possessing strong powers.

Abigail thinks to herself:
If “reality” and “dreams” are both a kind of “insanity” that can be touched by the hearts of man, and something which can be imagined, then it follows that they must undoubtedly all be real.
To separate reality as an exception is a tedious task only rooted in common practice.
Whenever her Master loses sight of themselves, or suffers as a result of the deviation between ordinary and extraordinary, she wants to be there to heal them.
After all, even Servants are nothing more than “dreams” that someone wished to be real.

### General Armaments

She summons flying hinges and grotesque organism; beach balls and float rings to play in the water; playful pranks of cat familiars.

### Connections with Characters

#### Nosh / Luthar

The black cat that often rests on my shoulder is called “Nosh”, and the gray, kinda fat one is “Luthar”. They are both my familiars I encountered in the dreamworld. Nosh is very elegant and handsome, while Luthar is super smart. That said, I’m a bit troubled by the fact that they keep sneaking away someplace I don’t know to fight each other. I feel the need to pray to God. Yeah…is there some sort of reliable cat god who can help, you think? / [2nd Ascension]

#### Ozymandias / Nitocris

I think Nosh and Luthar have taken an interest in the little sphinxes that follow Your Highness Ozymandias around. Awlad, was it? They’re so mysterious and adorable. My favorite has to be…well of course, it’s Medjed! / [3rd Ascension]

#### Archetype Earth

What’s wrong, Luthar? Hm-hm? You went to the very end of the dreamworld and found a very short but stout little princess in the form of a cat-like creature, who was spending her days cat-fighting with Mashu? A-aha… I see, I guess even such an incoherent dream must exist within that boundless world. / [2nd Ascension]

#### Kyokutei Bakin

I don’t like dogs who bark at nothing all the time. I just can’t understand why they are like that. I guess the dogs with Bakin are a bit different, though. Still, a friendly meeting with Gilles de Rais’ sea monsters would be way more fun. / [1st Ascension]
