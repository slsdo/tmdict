### Existence Outside the Domain: EX

Denotes a being descended from the void of the outer reaches of the universe. Possessed by an evil god, Abigail houses a portent of the god’s Authority within herself and wields it.

### Insanity: B+

Anxiety and fear. Deviations from harmony and providence. A heterogeneous thinking that exerts an influence even on the worldviews within the mentality of the people in one’s surroundings.
This is especially prominent in relation to the dreamworld.

### Divinity: B+

Having become the “Gate” for a higher-order existence lurking in outer space, Abigail is tinged with a strong divinity. An immeasurable threat that can even rewrite the image of the world. But as compensation, that Insanity cannot be removed.
Especially in the dreamworld, the attunement between Abigail and her god grows.
