Grants arts performance up.

### Otherworldly Creation: EX

She possesses the ability to put up a phantom world atop the mundane one once she has incorporated an abyssal aberration’s capacity to mirage.

### Independent Manifestation: E

Just like in her normal version she deliberately ranks down this skill. Downgraded as it may be, it still grants her resistance against effects such as Instant Death and Charm; it’s what allowed her to survive the mask’s Instant Death Hex.

### Logos Eater: D

Her disposition as the Pleasure Heaven. A way of life dedicated to toy with any sentient lifeforms. Ranked down from her normal Kiara’s origins.
