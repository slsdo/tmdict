### Mermaid’s Flesh: EX

Legend has it that those who ingest the flesh of a mermaid become immortal.
In Japan, mermaids are described as mere “human-shaped fishes” that lacks intelligence and cannot understand human language. In short, they’re soulless beings.
Since consume a soulless fish’s flesh cannot constitute murder, she hasn’t broken her vow at allー Even though the number of eaten mermaids has exceeded over an army, it doesn’t count as breaking, okay?
An author’s certain work portrays that mermaids do possess human intelligence, yet don’t carry souls as well. But let’s digress that.
Granted effects are HP Recovery (regen), Debuffs Removal, Guts, Noble Phantasm’s performance increase and the Mermaid’s Nourishment State that enhances the effect of the skills each turn after the activating. Summer Kiara’s greatest cheat skill that also buffs all her other ones.

### Divine Power (Ink): B (B+~A with the Mermaid’s Flesh)

Maybe she was jealous, or is it just BB’s influence over her?
Originally a common Divine Power, it has been modified once Kiara’s witnessed Katsushika Hokusai (Saber)’s artistical Divine Power in action and decided to make her own version.
Entitle to the same effects; NP Charge and Star Gain.

### Hamaguri Goten: A (A+~A++ with the Mermaid’s Flesh)

Clam Palace.
The breathing of the bottom-dwelling Divine Beast - Shen, that is said to surface a wondrous castle… in other words, that which can manifest mirages. Akin to Merlin’s Illusionism skill, this is a even viler illusion that completely corrupts people.
Inflicts the enemy with the state of Bewitchment, removes all of their defensive buffs, and grants Evade to all allies.
Those placed in Kiara’s Bewitchment cannot avoid her attacks, neither can do they attack her as they’re trapped into a illusion.
