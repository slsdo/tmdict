### Personality (lily)

A girl of docile disposition who takes joy in soothe those around her. A budding saint that seeks to listen and reassure the feelings of those who find themselves in situations of plight and vulnerability. Never mocking or looking down on others, she indiscriminately and wholeheartedly listens to whomever is confessing. Yet as a child, all she can do is listen to the sufferings and pains of those who come to her but she firmly believes that this act alone is of great help.
An earnest and considerate little girl. Isn’t she just like an angel? Though everything has it up and downs; since she’s embodiment of curiosity, proactivity and observability, she simply cannot overlook those who are troubled and runs to their aid as soon she spot them, even if no one asked for her help.
“Good morning, are you in trouble?”
“You’re? Okay, then please tell me everything about it.”
“Greetings, are you in a pinch?”
“Fufufu, I’ll counsel you, so please confess everything to me.”
With approaches like that getting commonplace some may see her as some sort of Sorrow Collector instead.

She fits more of a mascot-role, given her current case of amnesia (or that’s how she plays out). Thought there are at least two things Lily still remembers:
“I ate a mermaid and became a servant”
“My wish (vow) to help, even just a little bit, everyone who needs help.”
A glance was enough for her to understand the main character’s state of affairs who had arrived to repair the Singularity, and so she promptly teamed up with them to get to the root of the problem. As she has expressly sealed her own memories as Kiara, she had no idea she was one of the Horror Story’s masterminds opposed to Xu Fu. Lily was really trying to lift the Murder Rule governing the lake and prevent Mash from being deceived by the bad man (woman). Although she sporadically returned to her original self, her memories as Kiara weren’t yet passed on to her. She could only understand her true nature once she got to the source of everything by herself and understood her own truth.

In the end she unravels she will one day become the Demonic Bodhisattva but just sighs an okay with no hit of shock whatsoever.
Why do you ask? Well…
“No matter what version of me I’ll become, it seems I’ll be always helping those who need.” so she said.
Because Lily’s core part that lives to soothe others will remain her driving force (it’s not about save others from suffering but rather merely soothe them out from it).
“I love to make you guys feel better, but…it’s not like I can’t love to see you guys suffering because of that, right?”

### Personality (Adult Version)

Although she has consumed mermaid meat and calls herself Yaobikuni, Kiara Sessyoin’s personality remains the same.
“I am sole within creation. Whether good or bad, insects are insects. Whoever it may be, I will care for them, heal them, and love them with all my being…”
However, such a “love” satisfies Kiara alone. This great love may be the salvation for some involved, but in reality she isn’t doing anything different than play in Hell with outsiders who gazes at her.
That’s Kiara Sessyoin’s true colors… a savior who uses all her dispositions as such to please no one but herself… However, many things have happened this time, so she is just a little more attentive of her surroundings than usual. Who knows, maybe her yaobikunization has made her a little more tamed.

As soon as she returned to her adult self, she grasped the entirety of the incident taking place in the Lake. So Kiara started to make villainous moves to draw the main character’s suffering. She was 200% having a good time there. However, since their relationship wasn’t originally that bad she ended up siding with Chaldea in the end.

### Setting

“Summer Saint Graphs are quite a joy, aren’t they?” Kiara Sessyoin so easily acquired hers just like that.
Sensing the abnormality happening at the lake she urged and recklessly used her Independent Manifestation to tour there, but was suddenly eradicated by Xu Fu’s Immortal-Killer Mask’s ambush attack… Or should it have been. As Xu Fu’s mechanism was an Instant-Kill attack, Kiara wasn’t completely annihilated (her Independent Manifestation grants her Instant-Death Resistance) and so she respawned in her site of defeat, the Mariana Trench.
There she dug up the fossil of the Divine Beast - the great aberration Shen - and merged it with her through ingestion. While emerging to the surface from the seabed, she happened to also stumble upon a Mermaid Village and decided to add them to her attribute library as well.
“If I’m to revive, then I should make up for my childhood!”
So she had the great idea of reborn a High Servant as a little girl. Once in her Lily Form, she was bounded to not remember even her own name. Thus making Lily think that she was nothing more than a Pseudo-Servant of Yaobikuni.

Motivated to get revenge on Xu Fu, Kiara used her mirage powers to hijack the B Mountain and create an a fun environment for her while preserving the Death-Game’s rules. Side B’s False Main Character (Xu Fu) promptly scrambled to get to their feet; when they stated to “get to the bottom of it” as a priority, it was actually to “defeat as quickly as possible whatever had dug its claws here”.

Kiara’s lily transformation wasn’t simply a whim, but a way of getting off Xu Fu’s radar. Lily was trying to wholeheartedly help the main character every time, so when into a plight she would use her magical compactor (clamshell) to transform into Officer Kiara (Second Ascension) and beat up the evil guys. But as you may guess, Office Kiara is fully aware of the incident circumstances, so she gets extremely spiteful and sour towards the (Fake) Main Character.

### Lily-Kiara Transformation’s Timing

Lily can transforms into her adult self through her magical compactor (clamshell).
She’s unable to remember any of her adulthood’s records, so once she reverts her transformation back she doesn’t remember a thing anymore. On the other hand, her adult self has full access to Lily’s memories.

First Ascension: the chaste and candid Kiara, often spotted at the lake area. Ask are you Lily’s mother? and you will get a bloodlust-laded smile from her.
Second Ascension: Night-Part. Lily’s ace in the hole from when she’s on pinch - Officer Kiara.
Third Ascension: The scenario climax; Kiara once she displays her true colors and background. One of the final bosses.

### Incorporated Legends, Mythical Components

#### Yaobikuni

She calls herself Yaobikuni; a certain nun who acquired immortality after consuming mermaid flesh.

#### Shen

Shen is a Divine Beast hailed on ancient China and Japan as the causer of the illusions (mirages) that permeate the surface. Stories has it that it’s a colossal clam that dwells in the sea bottom, and when its bubbles (breath) surface out they cast out such phenomenon.
One of the components in the Japanese word for “mirage” is the “tower” character, which refers to an excerpt present in one of the books within the Sessoyin Bookshelf saying the follow: sowaka sowaka; thus, a meretricious-castle on the surface emerged. An Illusory City, which men bewitched with its illusory pleasures.
Superficially the component most present in Kiara appears to be that of the Mermaid, but in reality it’s that of Shen.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Kiara Sessyoin’s personality is an unchanging factor, however the composition of her Summer Saint Graph and the fun of the never-experienced Summer Vacation made her change her alignment from Chaotic Evil to Lawful Evil. Her current policy is not to immediately lead all those she spots to desire, but to gently guide to desire preferentially those who are experiencing pain and suffering. But that’s six of one and half a dozen of another, she will end up destroying their lives anyway; it’s like exchanging an immediate poison for a slow one.
Normal Kiara doesn’t move a hair from her Master once they’re not dependent on her, but Summer Kiara takes agency to seduce them. Once succumbed to the mirages of this woman all that awaits one is surely a dead end. However, as she is somehow gentler, more endearing and of a more eccentric palate, a misstep or two may be spared from be plunged into a end of line like that. Apparently she has become charitable enough to give them a chance to retrace their steps even after succumbing once.

<>

An Otherworldly Utopia. A mortar-shaped spiral trench.
The deepest, most abyssal sea bed, innermost as the Dragon Palace Castle.

“Fufu, I welcome you to my bed. I take that instead of the surface where you’re lost in pain and agony, have you chosen this Hell where you’re enticed in phantasmagoria?”

A graceful voice akin to wind, akin to dreams, akin to the heavens is chanted.
What for the woman was but an infinitesimal room, for that measly insect was an endless castle town.
A castle with no way back to the surface, because it had no need to.

“Now then, would you lean at my pinkie? I shall guide you to the pagoda where lies the joy and the dreams you so longed for.”

In a mirage that melts the edge of the body and mind, painless and freedomless, the woman thoroughly feast upon the emotions of the insect there.

You pleasure me, I want to stay here.
You fooled me, get me out of here.
You scare me, give me more here.
Please, I beg you. Let me go away from here.
A palm-top Land of Bliss where all is allowed.

### Dialogue Examples

“May flowers be thrown in the Abhiṣeka of Pleasure… All is but a feeble illusion. Come, surrender yourself to me in body and soul… Sluggishly drown into the depths of tranquility. Nirmāṇarati Heaven’s Foam.”
“Summer is finally upon us, isn’t it? Fufufu, poor thing… Fruits of labor, future and lovers are, just like that, within here. Now, thenー shall we head towards my castle?”
“Fufufu, you’re mine. Her hands tower beyond the mist as the grand palms join together in prayerー You shall no longer return to the mundane world.”
“You’re seeking for the guides of a Bodhisattva? Fufu…fufufu…fufufufufufu! What awaits you is the Pleasure Heaven; the Hell in which She pursues her prey who runs amok (fuh, a insect atop Her palm that She must blow out)… This pagoda is your-all’s Pure Land.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A character featured in the 2022’s summer event, Servant Summer Camp! Chaldea decided to do a group mountain camp this year, but the mountain was a cursed Horror Mountain Movie. During the day a crystal clear shining lake; at night an unparalleled terror and anxiety-triggering where even servants will die if murdered. The first victim - Yu Mei-ren (also this year’s welfare) was immediately killed, but being a True Ancestor of immortal characteristics she revived as a jiangshi and helped the main character to get through the seven days of horror.

“It’s impossible to leave the lake in this seven days”
“At night it transforms into a reproduction of the classics of serial killer genre”
“I always see summer runaway figures of Ilya, Abby and Lily. Although only one of them is truly scared.”
“Abby is a bad girl, she is getting closer and closer to being one with The Abyss.”
“Who is the culprit? And what will become of Sigurd and Brynhildr who have been delegated the role of the university student’s love birds?”

“Make sure reviving me is your top priority! Are we clear, Kouhai?”
Thinking back now, it these Yu-paisen’s Paisen Moves that were Chaldea’s pivotal hope…!

### Connections with Characters

#### BB

“Well, if it isn’t Miss BB. I’m a greenhorn Moon Cancer, so I’ll look forward to your helping from now on. I’ve no idea why, but if it’s the one that encroaches the Moon, I suppose I might fit the criteria somehow. I really, really have no idea why, though (giggles). Cyberbrain or Phantasmagoria; both have different specialties but undoubtedly share the ability to infinitely expand one’s consciousness. I wonder which of us will be the first to cross beyond the Milky Way?”

#### Abigail

“I shouldn’t be saying that, but about that… Foreigner, right? I don’t think you should beckon that type of servant. Among them, Abigail especially harbors something sinister. The Outer Universe that not even Buddha can reach… Not that I have any interest myself, but… That aside, could we speak of that cute thing! I’m, by no means, envying that perfect swimsuit of course…”

#### Kama

“Fufu. Her face of astonishment was so adorable that I couldn’t help but laugh. Apparently she thought she was the only one capable of switching between girl and adulthood. We’re the two sides of the Beast that loves mankind, so shouldn’t be that uncommon for one do what the other does, right?”

#### The Little Mermaid’s Author

“I can’t clearly record of Lily’s affairs unless I assume that form myself. No, that is not even necessary, I can clearly picture how the whole thing must have unfolded out. Not only did he act with complete inconsideration in a Singularity to which he wasn’t even called, but he mustn’t have accomplished anything in particular, right? For better or worse, it’s in his nature to completely captivate the readers’ hearts but not grant them what they want even at the very end ー that is the kind of fiend he is.”

#### Otohime

“A small good deed on a foreshore that befell misery upon a young man’s life… I’ve nothing but sympathy towards that. The Utopia and the Inhuman Demonic Realm are but two sides of a coin, cruelty of such beauty that it renders impossible to depict. I’m eagerly waiting for our Dragon Palace Castle duo one day. ☆”
