Heaven of Pleasure, the Clam Mandala.
It’s a subspecies of the Noble Phantasm of the shadow of Kiara Sessyoin that once ascended into a Demonic Bodhisattva and toyed with all sentient beings upon the palm of her hand.
Though she has yet to reach a Bodhisattva-scale Saint Graph, she can conversely exert a ultra-wide otherworldly zone once she has consumed the flesh of the top class illusionist-Divine Beast Shen.
In simple terms, she creates what you could call the Sessyoin Abyssal Demon Sea.
She leads her target towards depravity by casting them into the Illusory City of Shen, where the boundary between reality and illusion is blurredー To put it simply, once the target has found pleasure within it, in the spite of being an illusion (that’s to say, to lower themselves to an illusory existence) they are blended within it never to be considered a being of the mundane world again.
Once that happens, she will smile kindly to what was once human and dispel it along the Illusory City with a long breath, as there is no usefulness to preserve such a filthy illusion as that.

Nirmāṇarati does not stand just for “godly” but also “worldly”.
So as the name implies, the Bodhisattva who consumed Shen personified the paradise of desires itself.

A metal debuffer supermod Noble Phantasm; the damage increases proportionally to the number of mental debuffs that are stacked. It also has - albeit of minimal probability - an Instant-Kill effect.

Stages 1 to 2 are extremely Kiara-like with some slight Little Mermaid’s visual touches. While Stage 3 is a malefic visual bringing out her qualities as Demonic Bodhisattva (shen ver).
