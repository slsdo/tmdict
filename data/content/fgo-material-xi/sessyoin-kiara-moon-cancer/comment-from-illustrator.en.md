#### Adult Version

I like to think that Kiara is someone who would need to have all the reasons in the world forcing her to put on cute clothes. Isn’t the shell-pearl bikini just the right size? Have the flowers by chance stuck to her pareo? The braids maybe for the heat? Isn’t it summer? Isn’t she on the beach? Then how about spreading the wings a little once in a while? All for this First Ascension. (Wada Arco)

#### Lily

When I compared her to Adult Andersen my feeling was that she looked so tiny and fail that I had no choice but to mentally adopt her. But when I compared her with Child Andersen my feeling was that it would be nice to give her some vibe where she’d be the type to brag about being the older sister since she’s slightly taller, and so they could start to lock horns at any moment! About her bottoms, I think I managed to pull off something really cute for a swimsuit. (Wada Arco)
