Anti-Fling Rondo.
Fling is slang for “affair” or “one-summer love,” and by extension points to the summer monsters mentioned in the event. The spear Xiang Yu loaned to her, (or as she believes to be) the embodiment of his love, serves as an anti-summer monster measure. It packs an anti-male attack bonus stemming from her over-the-top prejudiced view.

Although Yu had no experience in martial arts or tactics, her love for Xiang Yu turning up a notch was what evoked the memories of the sword dance she once performed before him. This then gave her the idea of rearranging the choreography into a spear dance. For some reason, this Noble Phantasm turned out to resemble pole dancing.

It works in the same way as her original Noble Phantasm “Eternal Lament” in that she lets her magical energy run amok to generate abnormal weather as she destroys her physical form. What makes it different, however, is the use of Xiang Yu’s spear as the axis of her movements: Gaining a spinning trajectory generates a tornado-shaped curse instead of a rain of blood.
Her eternal lament has transformed into a rondo of death.
