### Personality

She’s not much different than usual, except that she is feeling slightly giddier after Xiang Yu loaned her his spear. And because she feels a stronger bond with him than ever, while she still hates humanity as a whole, her mercilessness particularly towards flirts who make advances on her has gone up a notch. Death to flirts.
[Her Noble Phantasm] activates on those (she accuses of) making eye at her even if they never did hit on her. 
Simply put, expect the possibility of a spear flying your way just by catching a glimpse of her swimsuit form. “Well, what can I say? Anything to remain faithful to my Lord Xiang Yu,” she retorts.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She’s not much different than usual, except that she’s even more head over heels for Xiang Yu.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’ll have you know I didn’t prepare this attire for you or some other rando. Lord Xiang Yu wanted me to enjoy this summer to the fullest, and that’s my sole reason for doing so. Anyone who dares to get in my way justly deserves eradication by this spear serving as his proxy. Consider yourself warned because I won’t be repeating myself.”
“Summer monsters, as in flirts? Uncontrollable excitement and getting carried away, perhaps? If so, Lord Xiang Yu was worried that I might find myself in trouble with such threats…showing how much he cherishes me… Hehe. Hehehehe…”
“Imaginary Lord Xiang Yu deployment complete. Spear dance simulation, start! Ohh, I see Lord Xiang Yu nodding in approval. And is that…a s-smile I see!? —-I’m…I’m one lucky woman!”
“What, are you planning to stay here forever or something? Time to reunite with Lord Xiang Yu. Now come on, start packing!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

This version of Consort Yu was one of the Servants featured in the 2020 summer event “Servant Summer Camp ~Chaldea’s Thriller Night~.”

She was all set and ready to head to the Singularity for a vacation with Xiang Yu post-mission. Unfortunately,  Xiang Yu’s calculations led him to the conclusion that, even if he must deceive her, it would be best she Rayshift without him. Shaken, her pillar of support in all this was the spear Xiang Yu loaned to her beforehand as well as the love it emanated.
After all, he did warn her about the dangers of summer monsters.

Yu found herself wondering what the so-called “summer monsters” are, later on finding out that the term is sometimes used to refer to the tendency of getting carried away and being prone to making mistakes such as hookups during the summer. “In other words, Lord Xiang Yu was worried I’d get hit on, so he gave this to me as protection!?” The love she felt has her at a fever pitch.
(The truth remains unknown… Xiang Yu’s calculations did initially inform him of the “presence of threat/s” and the “possibility of said threat/s being monsters,” but he may have phrased it as such simply because it was summertime, not necessarily aware of the definition of the slang.)

While she was utterly dejected that Xiang Yu was not around, she did not dwell on it completely. Using his love as her driving force, she was set on clearing this Singularity ASAP so that the two of them can finally go on a leisurely vacation together… Thus Yu commandingly led her unreliable Kouhai by the hand.

She ended up dying multiple times.
Again and again and again as if on a spree.
She even split herself in two like a planaria.
From the very start of this event, in fact.

——That summer may have been Consort Yu’s summer.

### Connections with Characters

#### Xiang Yu

Of course, I love my Lord Xiang Yu. 
If I may, what do you think…of this swimsuit…?

#### Prince of Lan Ling

Is that your summer attire? Not bad at all.

#### Beni-Enma

Enma, why not cut loose a little yourself?
…I figured you’d say that. After all, you would hate it more if we had no place to enjoy ourselves. I swear, you’re conscientious to a fault.

#### Sessyoin Kiara

*smug*
You lost…to LOVE!

#### Xu Fu

Honestly, I don’t know where to begin with you.
All right. First off, will you stop addressing me as Lady Yu?
