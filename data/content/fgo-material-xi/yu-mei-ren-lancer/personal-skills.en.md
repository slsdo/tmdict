### Summer Incarnated Elemental: A+

Transforming her Spiritron Origin into a swimsuit has no bearing on her incarnated Elemental state, but it has slightly optimized her for the summer. Her magic energy absorption efficiency increases when drawn from summer-related environments, such as water from a lake summer spot or dazzling sunlight. This method may seem unbecoming of a blood-feeder, but Yu herself doesn’t seem bothered by it.
Her preferences have not changed at all, so you might see her out sunbathing all the while complaining about the heat.

### The Conqueror’s Consort: EX

This is a skill she reacquired after having reunited with Xiang Yu at Chaldea. It defines her position as the Hegemon-King of Western Chu’s wife/lover, as well as signifies the strong bond they share.
Changing into a swimsuit has garnered more unwelcomed attention from others, to which Yu responds with an even stronger assertion: “I am this man’s wife!” In a sense, this may perhaps be a manifestation of her faithfulness.

### Dance From the Bygone Days: EX

This skill represents the sword dance she once performed before Xiang Yu. While she is firm with her distaste for human culture and sees no point in imitating them, she would occasionally bend that mindset for her beloved. 
She can’t tell if she’s objectively decent at it. She doesn’t give a damn about how others evaluate her for it. What she does know is that dancing was, at times, necessary. Xiang Yu’s evaluation of her dance and the look on his face as he watched her were between the two of them. That moment, along with this skill, was deeply engraved into her Spirit Origin as a precious memory.

This skill was designed to be sealed and unusable without Xiang Yu nearby. But this time around, the impact of his spear being loaned to her has broken the seal and made it usable through the spear functioning as Xiang Yu’s substitute of some sort. 
It has now been arranged to be a spear dance.
