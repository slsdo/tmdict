### Personality

Originally, Triton was beloved by all for his honesty and kindheartedness. Prince Dakkar was known to be both decisive in his actions and judgment as well as a man of faith. As Nemo is a Phantom Spirit who combines these two Heroic Spirits, his personality slightly deviates from each of the originals.

As both Triton and Nemo, this Heroic Spirit gained his own unique ideal: rebellion against domination and devastation. Even if it be a god, Nemo will not tolerate those who abuse the weak. Ironically, this principle extends to him rebelling against modern human society (consumerism) as well. Even now, he tends to get irritated whenever he considers European culture. Of course, Greece wouldn’t be an exception either, but according to him, “there are no national borders in the world of the ocean.” The sea child Triton is safe, even loved.

Upon his first appearance, Nemo did not show any emotion even when interacting with Protagonist or Mash. The memories of Prince Dakar frighten Triton’s innocent soul, and he developed an instinctual wariness for humans who are the authors of their own tragedies. So he can be very blunt at times…

His original personality is straightforward and affectionate, never abandoning those he likes. He is the consummate captain—tough as nails and possessed of a militaristic bearing. As someone responsible for many sailors’ lives, he is strict with others and even stricter with himself. He is an indomitable captain who always seeks solutions, regardless of the dire circumstances, and thus his expression remains cool at all times. When Nemo’s expression darkens, it means that “there is no solution left.”

Even if he cannot see the end of his friend’s travels, he numbers among the Heroic Spirits who truly love mankind, and so will always offer his blessings to humanity.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

While he carries the name of Nemo, Triton is one who gives his blessing to all manner of adventurous journeys. Upon his summoning as a Servant in Chaldea, he deems Protagonist a traveling adventurer, and so offers his blessings and guidance.

At first, he adheres rigidly to his given role, hiding his true self and insisting that he is “just a submarine” even in his interactions with Master. Gradually, as he lets down his guard on recognizing his Master is trustworthy, he becomes much more companionable, even friendly. Naturally straightforward and goodhearted, he will never betray those to whom he’s taken a liking. His silence remains unchanged. Due to his constant usage of “Memory Partition,” his brain’s energy consumption is high, craving sweets. He craves them, but as a captain, he never mentions it in public. When the Nautilus docks, he quietly sneaks off to a café to enjoy a parfait.

### Dialogue Examples

“Understood.”
“Hmm. Is that so?”
“Adorable like an ammonite.”
“Charming like a starfish.”
“Brave like an ocean sunfish.”
“As for my true name, I’ll keep it to myself for now.” “…I’m no one. I don’t have a name. If you have to call me something, just call me Nameless.”

(When excited)
“Submersion, commence! Full speed ahead!”
“I will not tolerate oppressing or mocking others. Captain Nemo will not tolerate it! Are you ready? We sail with the Nautilus!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

According to Hesiod’s “Theogony,” written around the 8th century BCE, Triton was born to the sea god Poseidon and the sea goddess Amphitrite. Amphitrite was one of the fifty daughters of the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. Triton himself is a sea god who presides over the depths of the ocean and blesses those who embark on adventurous journeys. In the “Argonautica,” written in the 3rd century BCE, Triton’s true form is described as having a divine, beautiful upper body and a monstrous lower body with a split tail like a sea creature. However, when guiding the crew of the Argo, he appeared in human form.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Triton, the merman who was raised and loved by the gods of the sea, is combined with Prince Dakkar, the character in the novel “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas,” or at least the man he was probably based on to create a “Phantom Spirit”. Although “Phantom Spirits” have only ever existed in the Pseudo-Singularity Shinjuku so far, an alchemist from Atlas named Sion managed to extract the data and summon this special Servant as a Phantom Spirit.

Sion opted to summon Nemo as a Phantom Spirit since she was worried about the success rate of a non-standard Chaldea summoning. By combining the Spirit Origins of two Heroic Spirits, a workable Servant Origin was created.

As a result, Triton bears the name and memories of Nemo and is unified with his “sea Noble Phantasm,” the submarine Nautilus. He wields a conch shell trumpet, as depicted in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” to control water and sound for attacks.

He appears as a Chaldean Servant from FGO’s second part, Chapter 3. Summoned by the alchemist Sion, who had taken refuge in Wandering Sea, Nemo helps upgrade the protagonist’s mobile magic workshop, the “Shadow Border,” to the “Storm Border.”

This “Nemo” has experienced and traversed the journey to protect human history. His exploits are strongly recorded in the world, and he eventually establishes himself as a singular Heroic Spirit rather than a Phantom Spirit. He often overlaps his Spirit Origin with Heroic Spirits other than Triton, but that is a story for another world.

### General Armaments

Nemo uses a jet water cannon modeled after a conch shell trumpet.

In addition to firing blasts, he can freely manipulate water, creating water tornadoes, blades, and walls as he wishes. Beyond controlling water, he can also perform sonic attacks, thanks to the trumpet.

Additionally, by having Sion as his Master, he gained the ability to use “Memory Partition,” which allows him to create duplicates specialized for different roles. These duplicates are known as the Nemo Series and are used for strategic operations. He also carries a concealed automatic pistol for intimidation, an attack method bestowed upon him by Sion.

### Connections with Characters

#### Sion Eltnam

The initial Master. A very rough mermaid handler who taught him much about humans. To Triton, filled with the prince’s memories, she repeatedly said, “Humans don’t only bring tragedy,” even though she had never experienced this herself. She spoke this with such strong conviction.

#### Jason

As a fellow captain, he finds Jason somewhat capricious but doesn’t dislike his adventurous spirit, which he himself lacks. “I feel like I used to be a bit cooler… Am I tangled in seaweed?”

#### Drake

An illustrious predecessor who overcame the impossible. “Like a flying fish born of grass, and a fierce captain like an orca. I wouldn’t want to be her enemy.”

#### Blackbeard, Anne & Mary, Bartholomew

“I cannot condone piracy alone. If you encounter me at sea, you’ll have to reflect accordingly.”

#### Columbus

“Your conviction is commendable. But your actions, I cannot condone.”

#### Caenis

As Nemo, he has no particular thoughts, but Triton’s soul has a strong aversion to Caenis. A Heroic Spirit whose life was disrupted by his father. He feels sorry but cannot tolerate their roughness and temper.

#### Poseidon

A father god like a storm, a volcano, or a giant octopus. “Having too much love is very difficult… I think one is enough for a destined partner.”

#### ○ Nemo Series

Operating a submarine, especially a military-grade vessel, is impossible for Nemo alone.

Anticipating that Nemo would eventually struggle to manage his own ship, Sion, upon summoning Nemo, incorporated the foundational and secretive skill of the Atlas Institute, “Memory Partition.”

As a result, Nemo can now create “specialized duplicates, each with nearly identical roles,” by dispersing his own magical energy. These duplicates are known as the Nemo Series, who work at the Wandering Sea Dock. As the story progresses, the Nemo Series members begin to appear as staff on the Nautilus and the Storm Border.

Including Captain Nemo, the gender ratio within the Nemo Series is 3:3.

#### Nemo Marine

Nemo Marine uses “boku” or “bokutachi” as their first-person pronoun. This is the most numerous series, with around 24 members (12 active, 12 in reserve). Although they share the same personality and appearance, there are slight individual differences. When acting as a group, these individual traits are suppressed. They handle all sorts of tasks on the ship, including cleaning, piloting, and maintenance. Their personality is endlessly cheerful and they harbor no hatred (though they can dislike others). During emergencies, they scream while fully committing to resolving the issue. This series exhibits the purest aspects of Triton’s character.

#### Nemo Professor

Nemo Professor uses “watashi” as her first-person pronoun. She addresses men by adding “shi” to their names, which gives Blackbeard a sense of affinity with them. Serving as the onboard scholar, she handles analysis, measurements, and strategy planning. Her demeanor is polite but somewhat downbeat and quirky. When greeting others, she often starts with a laid-back “Hai, konnichiwa,” beginning with “Hai” to convey a relaxed attitude.

#### Nemo Engineer

Nemo Engineer uses “atashi” as her first-person pronoun. She is the gruff, seasoned chief engineer who oversees the engine room. Among the Nemos, she is one of the rougher types but are a pillar of responsibility and possess a deep love for humanity. Their command of the engine room, the ship’s most dangerous and harsh environment, stems from a mother-like conviction to protect humans at all costs. She believes she could replace the captain if necessary due to their equal standing and the love they have for both humans and the Nautilus. Due to the high temperatures in the engine room, she constantly licks rock salt to stay hydrated.

#### Nemo Nurse

Nemo Nurse is the kind, older-sister type who uses “watashi” as his first-person pronoun. He manages the medical bay, remaining calm and methodical during emergencies. While he usually wears a gentle smile, h opens his eyes wide when angry. He is so skilled in science that he can substitute for the professor in the computation room when necessary.

#### Nemo Bakery

Nemo Bakery is the gentle, elder-sister type who uses “watashi” as her first-person pronoun. She manages the ship’s essential cafeteria. Maintaining the morale of the crew through meals, this Nemo is ultimately the most vital. In the harsh environment of the sea, surrounded by machines, she ensures the cafeteria is a comforting and vital place for the crew.
