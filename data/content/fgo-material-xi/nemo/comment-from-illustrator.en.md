The overall silhouette was designed to evoke the image of a shipâ€™s bow and ram splitting the sea, creating a wake. Originally intended to be a mermaid, the design varies in visual tension between the upper and lower body, with a structured look on the top and a somewhat precarious feel at the feet. In implementation, the captain turned out to stand firmly, without paying much attention to these details, which was fortunate. Designing the Nemo Series, each with the same face but subtly different individualities, was interesting. We incorporated small differences in their eyes and ways of smiling, which we hope you will notice and appreciate. (DANGERDROP)
