Great Ram, Nautilus.
Summoning the submarine Nautilus, this Noble Phantasm surges forward with its greatt ram. Endowed with a special concept, it may pierce any enemy, no matter how massive, be it a giant squid or a battleship. While this Noble Phantasm can be used outside the water (both above ground or in the air), it is far more accurate and powerful if it is used in the sea. It is more effective whenever the field is Near Water, making it a rare Noble Phantasm.
