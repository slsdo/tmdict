The designs for the three ascensions are different but I drew them all with the idea of a refreshing older sister dancing while swinging her weapon.
I was given the idea of an E-sports style from the beginning, but I didnâ€™t think she had gone from being a game fanatic to a real gamer
The 2nd and 3rd ascension weapons are actual swords but only the 1st ascension is the blade made of flames, and I think the hilt is probably just a controller. (Shirabi)
