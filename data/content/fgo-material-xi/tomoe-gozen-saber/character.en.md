### Personality

Almost the same as normal Tomoe Gozen (Archer)
However, since she is in off mode, she is fully ready to play.
If something goes wrong, of course she will be worried, but she never loses her desire to play, saying, “I have to enjoy the summer.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Almost the same as normal Tomoe Gozen (Archer)

### Dialogue Examples

I came to a realization while I was in this summer attire. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t concerned about my ability to maintain my moderation, but I also learned the phrase, “when in Rome do as the Romans do” so then this year Tomoe will comply, because it’s summer after all
Game Start
This was personally handed down from Lord Tajima!

VR… is what it is all about!

### Historical Image · Character Image

Completely identical to Tomoe Gozen (Archer)

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Every time summer comes around, the idea of moderation goes out the window for a handful of Chaldea’s Heroic Spirits…
Why is that?
Tomoe Gozen finally finds the answer when she experiences the phenomenon herself this summer. Namely…she realized that it triggers this irresistible feeling of passion, fire, and the sunlike power to flow from within…the feeling of liberation! Every year, Tomoe Gozen failed to understand the allure of summer, since events were always set in or around the beach. But this time, something clicked for her because this year’s summer event takes place in the mountains. Finally, her swimsuit Spirit Origin awakens!

That aside…exploring the mountains and forests isn’t the only thing to enjoy during the summer. That’s right…video games!

Now that summer has started, the time has come to play all you can, even if it costs you a bit of sleep!

The liberation sent by the mountain does not necessarily mean abandoning all moderation, but it pushes her to dive into the pleasures of a summer.

### Mochizuki Chiyome

Lady Chiyome, Lady Chiyome. Tomoe has an idea. If you wield a blade while enjoying VR and reality at the same time can’t that be called VR Shinkageryu?
