### Midnight of Summer Side: A

“Tomoe during the summer’s night is…embarrassingly different than her usual self.”
“Specifically…”
“I can play games all day long!”
A skill that enables one to pull all-nighters. As long as the user is enjoying the moment wholeheartedly, fatigue and magical energy consumption can be delayed until later. It’s a subgroup of the Battle Continuation skill, but its effect is quite different from the original skill.

### VR Shinkageryu: B+

The skill of one who is versed in using a sticklike controller for VR chambara. The skill especially enables one to excel in two-weapon fighting. Initially her rank for this skill was D, but after training directly under Yagyu Tajima-no-kami, her skill name changed, and the rank even shot up.
“The numerous moves I was taught by Lord Tajima-no-kami can definitely be applied as a dual-wielding sword technique in this VR game I play!”
…Or so Tomoe claims. And while Chiyome is suspicious that it’s essentially just plain old Shinkageryu, the sword technique in practice is very different than Yagyu Shinkageryu.

### Survival (Hill and Valley): EX

Skilled at surviving in the natural environment. Essentially this is a combined skill that includes the effects of several low ranked independent action skills.
Tomoe’s rank in this skill is non standard which allows her to spend her days in the hills and valleys peacefully without any contact with civilization
