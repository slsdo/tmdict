Lie Like Vortigern.
This Noble Phantasm is the true form of Oberon, a faerie who was brought into existence by the Lostbelt.
He transforms into the evil dragon Vortigern, a hollow insect tasked with destroying Britain. With his giant blender-like mouth and esophagus (hollow), he can swallow the entire world and send it plummeting.
Rather than killing the target, it serves as a path to the underworld that plunges them into an abyss devoid of any light.
