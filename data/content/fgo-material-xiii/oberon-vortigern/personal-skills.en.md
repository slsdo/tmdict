### Night Veil: EX

Night falls, bringing great success to the party and increasing their will to fight by escaping reality.
“You know those types who think they’re all that, pumped up and acting all cocky as soon as it gets dark out? Anyone can pretend to be a top-class expert. At least, until the sun rises.”

### Morning Lark: EX

Morning breaks, greatly uplifting one’s spirits and raising their self-esteem.
“Waking up feeling refreshed can even wash away your past sins. But it’ll always come rushing back to you when you least expect it to.”

### Dream’s End: EX

“Use that dream as fuel to soar through these unflyable skies. Oh, don’t worry about what comes after. You’ll have no reason to wake up after you crash.”
