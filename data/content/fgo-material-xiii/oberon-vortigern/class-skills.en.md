### Anti-Humanity: D

The power to put a hold on all things created by humanity and the laws that work in humanity’s favor.
Normally, the Beast class possesses this skill.
Despite being unable to hate or hold a grudge against humanity, Oberon’s eagerness to eradicate humanity is as instinctive as breathing. This allowed him to acquire the same skill possessed by the Evils of Humanity after deceiving and biding his time for such a long time.
Simply put, it is a form of malice that subtly sways the trajectory (or the mood) of people’s hearts and minds towards baser, eviler and cheaper things.

Moreover, Oberon is terribly incompatible with Merlin, another resident of the dream world, and will refuse all support from Merlin.
This rift was born from their differing stances on stories, and so Oberon allocates most of his camouflage abilities against Merlin.
As a result, during your journey throughout Faerie Britain, Merlin is unable to perceive Oberon. When Merlin sees someone talking to Oberon through his Clairvoyance, said person appears as if they are speaking to themselves.
Increases mental debuff resistance against all classes except for the Foreigner class.

### Territory Creation: E-

This rank was rated as such because to Vortigern, a territory considered good does not mean that the land is habitable for its people.

### Item Construction: A+

At first, he was the type of person who couldn’t be bothered to craft items, but when he ended up in a situation where he was forced to do so, he discovered he had a genuine talent for it.

### Riding: A

Reasonably skilled at mounting creatures.
He handles intangible matters such as trends, information, and interpersonal relationships with ease.

### Divinity: ―

“Haha. As if I’d have any.”

### Midsummer Night’s Dream: EX

A curse that Oberon has carried ever since he came into existence.
“While these visions did appear; / And this weak and idle theme, / no more yielding but a dream―”
And so that is how the curtains fall on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” the world’s most famous play involving faeries, but on the other hand they also represent Oberon’s nature.
In human history, his every word and action were labeled as lies, and as a result, he was inflicted with a curse where nothing he says or does is true.
He is 100% immune to mental abnormalities (Terror, Sleep, Curse).
(Lostbelt Oberon does not know where this curse stems from.)

### Fae Eyes: ―

These are not Mystic Eyes that humans possess, but are rather a type of vision that fae are born with that allows them to “alter worlds.”
These eyes, which see through all lies and reveal truths, allow Oberon to clearly see the malice, weakness, and nature of intelligent beings.
