The Faerie King. The character was supposed to have wings and be about as big as a normal human being, so I racked my brain about what I could do to make the wings stand out. I brainstormed all kinds of scenarios I probably didn’t need to think about, like what would happen inside a horse-drawn carriage, or when passing through a building door. His first ascension has the stage-play wings to match the setting, so I made it look like it was made out of papier-mâché, like a stage costume from a children’s storybook. (When I zoomed in on the wings of the swallowtail butterfly, I noticed they looked like a fluffy, thick wool carpet, which is why I designed it that way.) The second ascension design has a cloak that looks warm and foldable like a blanket, ushering in a great white winter. His third ascension was painted depicting something feeble, transparent, ephemeral, dark and beautiful left behind after casting everything off. There was a lot I had to learn as this was my first time doing this kind of work. But the elation of contributing to a great story kept pushing me forward. I am truly grateful I was able to have such a wonderful experience. (Umino Chica)
