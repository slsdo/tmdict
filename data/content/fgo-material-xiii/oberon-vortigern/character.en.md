### Personality (Beneath the Surface)

A handsome man with hair dark as a shadow, sunken blue eyes, and sharp protruding limbs.
He is evil incarnate, looking like a villain straight out of a fairy tale. A prince of darkness.

Since everything he says and does becomes a lie, he never speaks the truth.
He states his purpose in life is to watch people fall into ruin, but it is impossible to know whether he is telling the truth or not.
The reason why he spreads misfortune and looks down on everyone around him isn’t because he loves only himself and wants only himself to be happy. It is because he finds everyone and everything utterly revolting.
He has no love for others, nor for himself.

Because his Fae Eyes can discern the truth, he looks down on everything in his sight, and smiles brightly to hide the disgust constantly welling up in his chest.
(His public persona is all an act, but Oberon’s lies are so impeccable that they are not considered as fiction. If he is so inclined, he can live that way and have that become his true persona. However, since he is cursed to have everything he says be a lie, any truth in his words and deeds is rendered meaningless.)

He will never harbor any love for any living creature and human in existence.
To Oberon, humans and faeries are “meaningless, grating on the eyes, disgusting yet seemingly content” objects to be eliminated.
Because Oberon will never experience happiness himself, he is bitter and unable to understand why other living things can effortlessly achieve happiness simply by living.

“Damn bastards. I’ll destroy them all one day.” It is not clearly stated in the game, but Oberon’s aggression is not born out of jealousy or hatred, but out of his love for Titania.

→ At the end of Lostbelt 6, when Oberon reaches out towards the illusion of Titania while falling to his fantasies in Albion’s spirit cavern, he does so not because he is searching for the only person who understands him, his lover who might bring him salvation. It is due to his sorrow and hope over his nonexistent fated partner. Oberon isn’t sad about not being able to see Titania himself. Rather, he is enraged that she could never exist in this world. (He dreams of Titania’s happiness more than his own salvation.)

### Attitude towards Master

In the main story of FGO, he is the righteous prince who cooperates with Chaldea and the Master who have come to save Britain, as well as the pitfall who reveals his true nature at the very end.
Meanwhile, summoned as a Servant, Oberon (as a playable unit) acts as a guardian to support his Master on the surface, while keeping his fundamentally negative aspects hidden.
Although his evil side remains, he is now in a position where he will not commit evil.

Incidentally, Oberon’s parting line in his Valentine’s Day scene is, “That’ll be all then. Goodbye, Master! When you have no one else left to turn to, you can always call on me with a sigh!”
When he says that, he does not mean, “Call me when you need an ace up your sleeve,” but rather, “Call me when you’ve lost all your forces in the final arc and you’re at death’s door. I’ll join you.”

### Dialogue Examples

“Alright, I’ll tell you what I really think. I’m in the mood right now.”
“Aghhh. Haaagh. Ugh, that was disgusting. First the king of the Mors, now this? Huh, so I’m a Ghost Liner…a Servant now. I guess as long as they’re born out of people’s wishes, it doesn’t matter whether they’re based on a true story or not.”
“Wow, this is amazing. Everything I say or do ultimately becomes twisted. ’I love you’ becomes ’I don’t love you!’ ’I don’t love you’ becomes ’I could care less about you!’ Hmm. Oh well, that’s fine. I was already planning on lying through my teeth all the time anyway.”
“…Night veil, morning lark. The end of a rotten dream. Devour the twilight. Lie Like Vortigern.”
“…Don’t crowd around me. It makes me want to vomit. Can I grant you all an even greater conclusion? Die. Die. Die.”
“Did you find what you were looking for?”
“Oh, I don’t know about that. I’m always searching for her, even now. But even in a story with a guaranteed happy ending, she’s only the very smallest of bit players. She’s a convenient plot device, forgotten as soon as it’s no longer needed. No one ever gave a thought to her happiness when all was said and done. But that’s the life of a side character. You can’t stop to worry about every little thing, or the whole world will fall apart. You can’t expect that kind of imagination from a reader, or even from the playwright writing their script. Besides, it’s all just a fairy tale. She was born to be forgotten with the turn of a page.”
“So it’s okay. Fantasies just aren’t meant to exist.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Oberon first appears in Chapter 6 of Part 2, “Fae Round Table Domain, Avalon le Fae.”
In contrast to the Faerie Knights under Morgan’s command who treat humans like livestock and playthings, Oberon is a prince who unites the fundamentalist faerie clans living in harmony with nature.
He is also allied with the humans gathered in the ruins of Londinium.

He introduces himself as a Heroic Spirit from Pan-Human History, a Servant summoned to Britain one step ahead of Chaldea, fighting for the oppressed humans and faeries. That is the explanation he gives as to why he opposes the Faerie Knights. No one doubts his words because his reasoning is sound.

A dependable ally who flits between the three forces as he pleases from Act 1 to the finale, making each force fight against one another to lead the player to victory and save Britain.

However, he is not actually a Heroic Spirit from Pan-Human History, but an incarnation of the Great Calamity who desires Britain’s collapse, the will born of the island that would become Faerie Britain.
In the final arc, he transforms into the legend of destruction spoken of in Faerie Britain…the Abyssal Wyrm that returns all to nothingness.
The name Oberon was simply taken from Pan-Human History.
His name in the Lostbelt is Vortigern. He shares the same name as King Vortigern, the tyrant who led Britain to destruction by selling off the nation to various tribes in Pan-Human History.

Oberon the Liar. His existence, even his name, is a lie.
When his true nature is revealed, he declares without a hint of shame, “I have nothing I like,” as the edges of his mouth curl upwards. (Of course, this too is a lie. He has a love and attachment for his non-existent Titania, but will never admit it.)

The Autumn Forest is located on the outskirts of Faerie Britain (Wales).
It is inhabited by powerless insect faeries, tiny faeries who were unable to assimilate with the faeries in Faerie Britain and their mimicry of human society, due to their innocence and low intelligence.

This forest is where faeries who felt they didn’t belong in Faerie Britain, faeries who fled because they were bullied, and faeries who were persecuted for simply existing and “spreading poison,” gathered and ended up dying helplessly.
It was in this forest inhabited by those who had nowhere else to go, or those who died in obscurity hated and forgotten, that the Vortigern of this era…Oberon emerged.

Oberon is a Servant born from the British Isles, as well as being a doomsday device (Vortigern) created by the British Isles.
He has appeared as various forms of malice up in the past (the Mors King being one of them), and led the British Isles to its destruction. Once Morgan’s Era of the High Queen began, he was thwarted twice by her, which led to the creation of “Oberon” as the third attempt.
He is popular with Britain’s faeries because of his resemblance to the Wind and Wing clans, the most elegant of all clans in Faerie Britain, but he is not a faerie at all.
In fact, he is a single insect (ignobly) born from the excrement embodying the island’s revulsion for living things, disgust that a long-dead history has continued for over 10,000 years, and a desire to eliminate everything that lives on the island as well as all traces of the island itself.

Ironically, when the British Isles produced the “Ancient Faerie Oberon,” his Spirit Origin overlapped with that of the “Faerie King Oberon” thanks to the influence of Pan-Human History that Morgan brought in.
This is the reason why Oberon is so bitter towards Morgan.
“Who wouldn’t want to complain? I could’ve been born as an Albion-class dragon, but here I am as a lowly faerie who can only spew out lies.”

### Hollow Insect

Below is the text description provided when commissioning its design.

This is his Noble Phantasm in his third ascension form. A hollow insect that will destroy Britain.
Overall, a fantastical insect with dragon attributes. Looks like an Eastern dragon, not a Western one.
Like a beetle, but its outer shell is crumbly and dry, and constantly falling apart.
Its motif is “a gateway into another world,” like a hole into the abyss or the tree hollow that Alice falls into from “Alice in Wonderland.”
Hence it is more like a phenomenon than a living thing.

A long, pongee-like body, completely hollow, with a head (or the superior end, rather) that chomps on everything and sucks it all up like a vacuum cleaner which then passes through the body cavity. Whatever has been ingested will continue to fall for eternity and eventually turn into debris.
As a result, although the head portion exists, the tail end appears hazy and cannot be depicted clearly. It almost looks like a haze seen over a horizon.
The outer layer is see-through from the inside, allowing the sunlight to pass from outside. The interior is bright, making it seem as if you are surrounded by a twilit sky.
For Chapter 6’s climax, the battle between the player and Oberon in his third ascension (boss form) surrounded by the twilit sky inside the Abyssal Wyrm will be the final battle that takes place in Faerie Britain.

### Within the Forest

“This Lostbelt is one of many stories. A fourteen-thousand year-old picture book Morgan wrote just to have somewhere to belong to, even if it had to be fictional.”
“And you people rejected it, just like you have all the others. You said it was wrong - that it was meaningless.”
“I didn’t like that. You make up characters who behave exactly how you want, put them in the kind of stories people dream about, then you just laugh and dismiss them as nothing more than flights of fancy.”
“There’s still meaning to be found even in the most hackneyed of kingdoms, or the most unsung side characters. All those stories you people from reality just forgot the moment you finished the last page? They had every bit as much right to remain afterward as anything else.”

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria Caster

Ugh, I can’t believe I dug myself into a hole! “You might feel lonely looking for a star you know doesn’t exist, but it’s also kind of fun.” I sure let my tongue slip there!
That’s the exact opposite of what the Child of Prophecy, Britain’s savior, should be doing!

#### Master of Chaldea

I told them they were nothing more than a spectator, but then they came up on stage.
Onto an empty stage with the curtains closed and the lights out, no less?
How far are they willing to go, I wonder?

#### Da Vinci

Being a theorist must be a pain in the ass.
Even if you have an underlying suspicion that someone isn’t who they seem, you can’t do anything about it until you have proof.
She was a tricky opponent, but an easy one too at that.

#### Gareth

A knight who couldn’t save even a single person. But as a result, she became a knight who changed her fate.
But good grief…I never wanted things to go that far. Not that I’ll ever admit it.

#### Cnoc na Riabh

A woman who actualized her dream, but never got to relish it for even a second.
If she ever gets another opportunity, I’ll cut her some slack.

#### Spriggan, Woodwose

Thanks, I couldn’t have done it without you folks! But you know, Woodwose, couldn’t you have been just a tad weaker? I really thought it was going to be game over back then.
…Huh? Doesn’t that mean Gareth was helping me too, at the time?

#### Aurora

I enjoyed chatting with her. Had zero substance to her words whatsoever.
But hey, isn’t that how life is 80% of the time?

#### Percival

He was supposed to exit the stage halfway through the performance, but he managed to hang on until the end.
I didn’t mean to prolong his pain, but if he was fine with it, then that’s his choice.

#### Nursery Rhyme

I asked her if she wanted to have a party with me if humans are ever eradicated.
Of course, I was immediately turned down with a smile.
“Such a thing will never happen as long as we exist.”
I feel lonely, but that’s life. That’s not the case with stories, however.
