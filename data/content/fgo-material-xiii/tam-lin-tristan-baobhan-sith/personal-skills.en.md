### Grimalkin: A

A skill crowned with the name of a cat fairy, the companions of the English witches. The characteristics of cats are interpreted in fairy style as ‘eliminating the sound of footsteps, lightening one’s weight and increasing one’s speed’. While Baobhan Sith’s usage is fairly effective, the original wielder of this arcana displays speeds capable of circling the Earth in a mere day.

### Blessed Scion: EX

As the acknowledged daughter of Fairy Queen Morgan, she also possesses the Regal Authority of Domination. Akin to the knight who admonished the Knight King in Pan-Human History, she exerts enough control over space to offer her opinions to Morgan. (Mana domination zone). She halts all enemies’ NP gain (doesn’t decrease their charge), seals their skills, and charges her own NP gauge.

### Fae Vampirism: A

Her ability as a vampire. She absorbs the target’s HP and NP. Though it has since waned, the former Baobhan Sith loathed this arcana and would not use it in front of others. However, the Lord of Darlington forced her to abuse it out of amusement, resulting in the city’s transformation into a necropolis overflowing with corpses.
