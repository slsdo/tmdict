My favourite types of characters are those who meet tragic, forlorn fates, which is why I feel very thankful that I got to design Baobhan Sith, who fits perfectly within that archetype. The more desolate a character’s death is, the more stimulating their fleeting lives become. However, Baobhan Sith’s journey was far more sorrowful than I could have imagined, and I found myself deeply moved that someone was able to depict such an ephemeral tale when playing through it. She’s truly a beautiful character that’s very close to my heart. (Mochizuki Kei)
