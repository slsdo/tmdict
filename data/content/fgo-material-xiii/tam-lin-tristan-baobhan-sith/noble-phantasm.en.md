Fetch Failnaught.
A wicked attack (kiss) that curses the target to death without fail, regardless of the distance. The user creates a double of the opponent from a part of their body (hair, nails, etc.), then eliminates the target by killing the copy. Essentially, a fairy version of the ushi-no-kokumairi ritual. Fetch is the Scottish equivalent of a doppelgangerâ€¦ indicating the existence of an inhuman being identical to yourself.
