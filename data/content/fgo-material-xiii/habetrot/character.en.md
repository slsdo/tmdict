### Personality

Habetrot can be described as introverted yet active. She shies from asserting herself but is driven in her approach when it comes to what she must do and wants to do. She likes good people and hates the wicked. Although she can distinguish good from evil as someone Neutral-aligned, she doesn’t fixate on which side counts as superior. This stems from how she generally doesn’t hate others.

Habetrot’s values are reflected as such: Peace is comfortable and much preferable, whereas conflict is draining and awful. As a general rule, let Habetrot enjoy her sewing and needlework and she’s a happy faerie.

Be it Proper Human History Habetrot or Lostbelt Habetrot, her nature proves consistent. Whenever she finds a girl she feels is the one (someone she feels has the right to become a happy bride), she pulls out all the stops to care for and support her. Habetrot refers to such girls as “my brides.” Either she will set out to find another bride immediately after sending off the former, or if she finds one more good candidate while already attending to another bride, Habetrot will become engrossed in supporting both. This has led to some describing her as easily infatuated.

Habetrot won’t admit it, but she’s a bundle of devotion. The way this faerie tends to prioritize her brides’ happiness over her own illustrates her self-sacrificing trait.

### Habetrot in Faerie Britain

She appears as a spinster faerie in the Fragment chapters. Together with Aesc the Savior, they settled disputes all over Britain. Habetrot’s fate changed significantly when she met Mash, who rayshifted to Fae Era Year 400… Or rather, this faerie made every effort possible to overcome her fate.

When Aesc the Savior and the original Tam Lin stepped down the stage, Habetrot roamed Britain alone and popularized the culture of wedding traditions, sending off many brides in the process.

By the time the new High Queen Era was adopted, Habetrot turned herself into a stone inside a twisted hole in the north and would stay asleep until a certain encounter in 2017. After ever so nonchalantly saving Mash in Sheffield, she would then guide the Master of Chaldea to Orkney, coming to terms with the choice she made.

She originally went by the name Totorot in the Lostbelt and only began calling herself Habetrot after waking up from her stone slumber. The reason for this is that she came to admire Proper Human History Habetrot’s way of life from the legends Mash taught her.

Habetrot was originally a wild hooligan of the Wing Clan and became a member of Aesc’s party following her defeat in their duel. (Although a spinster faerie by nature, she had no means of fulfilling her innate purpose of sending off human brides in the Lostbelt. This “existential conflict” tormented her, giving rise to displaced emotions that turned her into a wild hooligan.) From that point onward, she would achieve exploits as one of the original Tam Lin who fought alongside Aesc the Savior. 

The Fragment chapters also reveal that the name “Mash” was written on Mash’s shield in chalk. This was done by Habetrot. When she asked her to show the shield, she deftly wrote Mash’s name on it. The use of a tailor’s chalk is proof that it was Habetrot’s doing.

Brides are “treasures” in Habetrot’s eyes because she is a faerie that will never grow into adulthood. She longs to become a bride herself, but that is a wish never to come true. So at the very least, she wants to protect the future of the beautiful girls she falls in love with at first sight. This could be seen as compensatory behavior on Habetrot’s part, or perhaps, as her radiant dream. “Maybe one day… No, scratch that. I wish I could become like them, too.”

### Dialogue Examples

“Brides are great! They’re just so soft and sparkly. Pretty like flowers and dazzling like birds, get what I mean? What reason is there not to love them!”

“Well, that sucks. Habbycat hates fights.”

“Who’s your fave bride? Aww, c’mon~ How couldya keep me out of the loop~”

“Sure it gets grueling, but I have to push through! I’m a maiden after all!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Habetrot is a spinster faerie from Scottish folklore said to weave cloth with thread spun from cotton flowers and flax fibers and to make garments out of it. She is often portrayed as a small hunched old lady the size of a human child. Habetrot is also known as a faerie that helps women who are preparing for married life and tailors gown on behalf of busy brides–in other words, every bride’s dream faerie. 

In addition to that, clothes woven by Habetrot are considered to be imbued with a mysterious power that relieves its wearer of their illness.

### Connections with Characters (Totorot from Fae Era Year 400)

#### Aesc

I used to be hot-tempered, you see. Communication wasn’t my strong point, and all I could do was take my mood out on everyone around me. Despite my shortcomings, Aesc met me at my level with sincerity and invited me to travel the world together. The spell she hit me with hurt like hell, but even that pain has become a fond memory of mine!

…Which was why I was rooting for her happiness. I really was.

#### Mash

Mash is my number one drive. She’s the one who gave my life a purpose, from the turning point to my goal. Whatever awaits us in the future, I’ll practice extensively and build as much experience as possible, all in hopes of gifting her a wedding dress as radiant as the stars with a touch of some words of gratitude.

### Connections with Characters (Habetrot)

#### Miss Crane

Crane makes it in my top 3 reasons I’m glad to be summoned in Chaldea! There’s so much to learn from her cutting-edge expertise, not to mention she’s a phenomenal fashion pro. 

If I’m being honest though, I find it a bit of a shame. ‘Cause look how pretty she is, right? I sure would love to design a Spiritron Dress modeled after her…

#### Caster Artoria

Isn’t she a Faerie from the Inner Sea of the Planet? How come she’s such a tomboy?

#### Oberon

I [look at him and] find myself thinking, as a fellow faerie, “Now that’s a faerie.” Oberon is the paragon of our kind on account of both his cool side and liar side.

#### Red Hare

That’s an Asian kelpie, right? Who thinks he thinks he’s human?! Gosh, isn’t he such a character?

On another note, talking to Red Hare makes me a bit emotional. I wonder why.

#### Britomart

No way, Britomart turned into a faerie?! When you became a Heroic Spirit, did your class change to faerie for successfully defeating a tyrant? Whoa! You’re a hero, the real deal! 

Both your red and white dresses are of the highest grade, gifts from Gloriana herself… Wait, you inherited the name from your mother? Britomart II? …Whoa, hold on. I’m getting info overload from your personal history!

#### Mash

She’s my current fave bride! I don’t know how exactly I became the guardian faerie of the Black Barrel, but even if I wasn’t, I’d still love to make a whole bunch of outfits for her. The same goes for you, who I believe will be the one linking arms with her!

#### Morgan

Everybody says Morgan is terrifying, but she’s elegant and graceful and attentive. I like her. How could I not, when she has such a sweet visage! 

…Not that I don’t get where they’re coming from. When she’s mad, the temperature in the room instantly drops below freezing.

### Scenario Note (Please Read this After Finishing Lostbelt 6)

Throughout their pilgrimage across Faerie Britain, the broken Black Barrel was stowed hidden inside the Spinning Wheel Habetrot rode. It ceased to function the moment they set foot in the isles and suffered further damages after being forcibly used. 

During the siege of Sheffield, Mash’s “aversion to fighting”, which lay hidden in her subconscious, prompted her to abandon the Black Barrel. Habetrot happened to be around when she did and stole it from under their enemy Beryl’s nose. She then chose to continue their journey all the while hiding what she did even from Mash.

Habetrot’s actions may seem motivated by curiosity and greed at a glance, but that is not the case. Simply being in possession of cutting-edge machinery, such as the Black Barrel, is in fact poison to faeries. Nevertheless, she held onto it for safekeeping until the very end all because of a hunch that Mash would one day need it.

Habetrot continued to guard the Black Barrel unbeknownst to anyone, even as it chipped away at her Spirit Origin, all so that she could send it as a gift for her dear friend Mash’s future.
