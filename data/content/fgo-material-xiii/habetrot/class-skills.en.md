### Riding: C

Habetrot is too scared to ride animals, but she can control her “Flying Multipurpose Spinning Wheel” at will.

### Item Construction: B

Crafting tools is also right up the alley of deft-handed Habetrot. Although she can’t create Mystic Codes, her finished outfits tend to have a tinge of Mystics to them and can be used as Craft Essences instead. 

### Fae Eyes: C

Time begins to flow slowly by viewing reality with a faerie filter, which can come in handy when parrying critical attacks from enemies.

### Tam Lin: B

“Keep it between us, okay? I was actually one of the original Tam Lin!”

That said, Habetrot is a Tam Lin only by title since she became one prior to the development of Gifted Names. She doesn’t suffer any penalties from fighting fellow Tam Lins.
