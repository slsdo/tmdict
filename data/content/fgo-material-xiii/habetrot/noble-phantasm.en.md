Spinster Habetrot, also known as the Habbycat Cannon.

Habetrotâ€™s original Noble Phantasm [Bridal Spinning Wheel] is a dress that accentuates a bride. However, due to various circumstances, it has been changed into an insane cannon that fires insane shots.

Magical energy is generated through the Flying Spinning Wheel rather than a Magical Reactor when Habetrot uses it. This Noble Phantasm then turns into a physical weapon that fires in the form of a railgun. The concept of natural span does not apply to it.

(Chaldea summoned Habetrot from Proper Human History, so she might not have any idea as to why this weapon is stored within her soul.)
