Regardless of their class, Faerie Knights possess powerful magic resistance.

### Madness Enhancement: A

Barghest appears to have no mental abnormalities, but she must prey on her partners on a regular basis. After being assailed by this impulse, if it is not resolved promptly, she will go mad and turn into a Berserker who will slaughter everything indiscriminately, over and over again.

### Faerie Knight: A

The divine protection of being chosen as the protector of the fae folk. An oath (geass) for the fae.
It is a self-buff specialized towards Anti-Unit and Anti-Civilisation that forbids attacking other Faerie Knights; a Faerie Knight that has killed another Faerie Knight will destroy themselves.
