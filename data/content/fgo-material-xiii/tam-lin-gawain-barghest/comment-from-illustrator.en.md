Since her setting was of a “character that is actually kind and easily cries”, my initial design had her with kinder eyes. However, seeing those, Nasu-sensei replied with “Your specialty is lowering the bond levels of female Servants who have a piercing gaze by simply talking to them, right? I’m also quite good at that. Well then, please give back that feeling in the design.” I made the adjustments in high spirits. And that is how the Faerie Knight with a sharp gaze was born. (Melon22)
