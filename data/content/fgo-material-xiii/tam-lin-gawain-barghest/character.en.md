### Personality

Diplomatic and passive.
Without hiding her feelings, she will share her intentions in a straightforward manner and then confirm the other party’s feelings.
She is a majestic and proud knight who has nothing to be ashamed of, but when it comes to her (military) actions, she is the careful type who will take a proper look at the state of affairs first before making a move.
She will only take up her sword and go “Now then, let us annihilate these weaklings” after she has taken into account the conditions of both sides: the enemy’s and her own.
Her form trampling down the weak without mercy once she appears on the battlefields is why they call her a ruthless knight.

Although she has a strait-laced personality, since she has a noble upbringing (meaning she is well-educated), she has the composure to appreciate jokes and has a fundamentally amicable way of thinking.
However, since the person herself is not good at telling jokes or making others relax through the art of conversation, she isn’t too talkative.

Perhaps due to considering the rule of survival of the fittest as absolute, she lets her guard down around those who feel “strong” to her, growing close to them and taking them as her lover.
In truth, she is someone who easily succumbs to loneliness, so she is quick to fall in love.
In the past, she has taken many races…without distinction between men and women or fae folk and humans…as lovers.
However, those relationships didn’t even last a month, and she returned to being single right away.
While others call her a faerie full of love due to this, it made her end up on the receiving end of Faerie Knight Tristan’s nasty remark of “I simply get bored of things easily, I am not at your level where you fall for others left and right”.

As a Faerie Knight she might behave in a stout-hearted and cold-blooded manner, but her true nature is that of a kind crybaby.
Burying her face in her hands wet from blood after having preyed upon her lover without meaning and going “Uu, uaah, UAAAGH…!” as she wails in sadness and rage directed at herself is her constant.
Having experienced this over and over again, although she is barely able to keep standing thanks to her pride and responsibility as a member of the Faerie Round Table, she has a fragile mentality where if she were to cease being a knight, she would end her own life.

### Setting

A member of Lostbelt Britain’s Round Table.
The most feared Faerie Knight in the Land of the Fae.
She’s also known as “Loving Barghest” and “Lord Black Dog the Partner-Eating”.
She is a Fae Knight assuming the name of the Heroic Spirit Gawain, one of the Pan-Human History’s Knights of the Round Table.
While she hails from the ’Fang Clan’ renowned for their strong bodies, her Saint Graph is humanoid appearance-wise. This is due to the curse of the King of Moss, the Calamity that the Fang Clan defeated in the past.
“When the one with the most outstanding talent in the Fang Clan is born, they will be an unwanted child within the Clan who will never find a mate.” is how the curse goes.
The cold knight that manages and rules over humans.
Hailing from a Faerie Clan, she would be a young lady from the family of a Count if you were to put it into human terms. However, she has a way of living that she could never reveal to anyone.
A curse of ’being unable to resist eating her beloved’.  
Her life consisted of falling for others, then swearing she would endure and not give in to her urge to eat them this time, but ending up preying on them anyway.
The predations where love and joy mixed together with grief and pain had caused her mind to collapse a long time ago.
However, due to her sense of responsibility, she couldn’t deem “committing suicide to end it all” acceptable, so, as a way to atone for eating her lovers, she continued to preserve the peace of Britain while hiding the fact that her heart was already in tatters.

Ascension 1: Faerie Knight Gawain
The form chosen by Barghest who loved the tales of Pan-Human History’s Knights of the Round Table and held them in high esteem as the ideal knights.

Ascension 2: Everyday Clothes - Young Lady from a Respectable Faerie Family
In this form she has taken off her battle armor and is clad in a lovely dress.
While Barghest might have been an outcast, she is a noble young lady of the ’Fang Clan’ who hails from Oxford.
Afterwards, due to her distinguished services as Faerie Knight Gawain, she was given Manchester and became its lord.
When they held a ball and the like, she participated while wearing a dress like this.
While she might not say these out loud, since “I’m always ready for wonderful encounters and a wonderful love!” is what her personality’s like, she is quickly becoming a rising star in social circles.

Ascension 3: Demonic Hound Barghest
The monarch of the black faerie hounds. One of the ’Three Calamities that will destroy Britain’ foretold by the prophecy of the British Lostbelt.
The ruler of flames and thunderclouds. Her surroundings are constantly engulfed in flames and she grows by consuming the dark smoke created by the burning animals and towns.
While she will eventually transform into a Demonic Beast in the form of a gigantic hound, this is her form when she has somehow managed to seal away that curse.
Once fully grown, the Demonic Hound will turn into a spirit devourer (elemental eater), so no attack from the fae folk will work on her and she will become a literal ’calamity’.

・Chains of the Black Dogs
Countless chains are wrapped around Barghest’s left hand.
These chains are the ’collars of the hounds’ and Barghest is always walking around with countless man-dogs (slaves transformed by Barghest’s mana) by her side.
Although it indicates her position as the queen of the slaves (humans), Barghest herself does not consider this act of subservience as something inhuman.
If her Master were to say that her actions are cruel, she would give them a puzzled look and reply with “I’ve heard that the humans on your side express their affections for their “dear friends” in the same way, though?”
Originally, the barghest should be the one that is tied up in chains, but in the Lostbelts, there exists the irony that “the one that should be bound by chains” is the one “wielding the chains”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Her mental state has stabilized somewhat from being summoned as a Servant, however her urge to eat her object of affection…or rather, her tendency for falling in love did not change at all.
Therefore, to avoid falling in love with her Master, she’s devoting herself to acting in moderation every day.

### Dialogue Examples

“To think you’d attack by taking advantage of a gap in our defenses. Your cunning wits alone are praiseworthy.
However, it’s too meager. Your conviction is weak and feeble, fitting for a human.
If you are going to hide in the shadows and commit thievery, then you won’t complain when you get crushed underfoot, right?”
“You’ve quite the nerve to set foot in Lostbelt Britain, you inferior creatures who arrogantly regard themselves as the apex.
In your world, decorum dictates that you welcome visitors from afar, right?
Good, take up your swords! As you wished, I’ll give you a warm reception to your heart’s content!
My name is Gawain!
One of the Faerie Round Table, the protector of Britain!
With this name bestowed upon me by Her Highness, I shall trample you down!”
“This horn (sword) is the substantiation of the law. A rampart of geothermal heat that denounces all injustice. Make them kneel! Black Dog Galatine!”
“I apologise. Even though you are just a mouse, I went easy on you.
Get crushed────Black Dog Galatine!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A faerie talked about in the northern parts of Englang. It appears in the form of a dog bound in chains with blazing horns and eyes. It is also said to appear in the form of a white cat.
In the cities, it is also a faerie that notifies of death and is said to appear when someone dies. It is also said to march through the city in the company of its subordinates (dogs) when a person with an important role in the city dies.
Outside the cities, it transforms from a faerie that announces death into one that bestows death, appearing often on the plateaus.
In the legends about the fae folk passed down throughout the whole of England, it is thought to be a type of Black Dog.

### Role within the Game

Similar to Gawain in Part 1 Chapter 6, she stands in the way as a threat in the first half.
She makes her appearance as the first wall blocking Chaldea, but she is a person of character that makes one think that this knight alone will become Chaldea’s ally as the story advances.
In fact, she wishes to save as many faeries and humans as possible in the Britain that is fated for destruction, and agrees to the migration plan proposed by Chaldea, but…
She is one of the calamities prophesied to destroy Britain, the Calamity of the Beast.

### Connections with Characters

#### Morgan

The lord she swore fealty to. Morgan is also quite fond of Faerie Knight Gawain.

#### Faerie Knight Lancelot

Even though she might also be one of the knights following Morgan’s orders, Gawain hates Lancelot.
The rumor among the fae folk that Lancelot is stronger than Gawain is also aggravating, but the reason for her dislike is that she has grasped that despite the strength Lancelot possesses, she is not serious about protecting Britain.
In addition, Gawain, who holds a tiny bit of love for all life, does not feel an ounce of love (appetite) towards Lancelot alone. This is because she managed to perceive on instinct that she is ’a filthy being that is neither faerie nor human and does not belong here’.

#### Faerie Knight Tristan

She can not get along with the uninhibited and reckless Tristan, who treats fae and humans alike as toys that she will break.
Tristan, on the other hand, having taken notice of how Gawain reeks of blood, wants to get along with her as people of the same kind, due to Tristan being one-sidedly sympathetic towards her.

#### Knight of the Round Table Gawain

The leader of the Knights of the Round Table that she respects.
“Those who possess a heart stronger and more just than that of others’ will denounce the evil that torments people.” For Barghest, who was isolated within the Fang Clan as an unwanted child, those knights’ code of conduct was something she yearned for and an ideal she pursued.

#### Artoria Caster

A powerless faerie who keeps pestering her.
Once she was confirmed to be the ’Child of Prophecy’, she became a target to be eliminated; however, that was only done for the sake of the Land of the Fae. She held no hatred for Artoria Caster herself.
…In fact, the childhoods of Barghest and Artoria Caster have a lot in common, which is also why the two of them feel “comfortable when they are together, even though they don’t get why”. Of course, the people in question are not aware of the reason behind that.

### Scenario Note (Please Read this After Finishing Lostbelt 6)

→ While Barghest might have eaten several lovers of hers, she is desperately trying to control her instincts so she won’t eat her current lover.
They are the person she’s loved the most so far and the one she respects from the bottom of her heart, having sworn to stay by his side. The boy who protected Barghest’s heart that was about to shatter.
→ Due to being bedridden, her lover is sheltered in the innermost room of Barghest’s manor. He has become a rumor among the faeries as well. Apparently, he is a human boy, he’s blind, and his heart is very beautiful.

→ Even Barghest herself is perplexed by her affections that go against the Wild Rule, but at the same time, it also brings her joy. ’She only loves the strong, because eating them will make her stronger’ is how things went so far, but since her current lover is clearly a weak person, she wouldn’t get stronger even if she were to eat him.
→ For Barghest, who had been eating the strong to become more powerful, ’loving’ her current partner proved that she was not a beast and brought her comfort. She was reassured that if it was this boy, things would be fine. There was ’no reason to eat him’ in the first place, after all.
→ However, both her body and mind were torn to pieces during the ’wars that occurred before Chaldea arrived’ and the weakened Barghest ended up predating on the boy. Being strong or weak had nothing to do with it. She was simply a beast that ’wanted to eat’ those she loved. → Having reached that point, Barghest was thinking of killing herself this time, but that memory was consigned to oblivion by Oberon. (Her contract with Oberon: “It would be so sad for you, an upright individual unique among the fae, to commit suicide.” “For your sake, I’ll make you forget that memory.”)
→ And so, the ’boy’ Barghest kept swearing to ’protect’ and had nursed on several occasions during the scenario was nothing but a delusion of hers, a recollection of the past.
→ The faeries pretended to be unaware of the fact that Barghest had eaten her lover. The fae folk that witnessed Barghest eating her lover while she was peeping on them spread the news to the others and turned it into a story told for laughs.
→ The faeries under Barghest’s protection started imprisoning humans and eating them as a form of entertainment, calling such actions ’imitating Barghest’. This caused them to turn into evil fairies, and massacres became rampant throughout the city.

→ Having agreed to the plan of migration, the faeries and Barghest were hoping the Border would serve as their ark, but Barghest realized how evil these (her country’s) faeries were and began to slaughter them all with her own hands.
→ Even while she burned herself in disappointment in the fairies and despair at her own foolishness, Barghest took responsibility, saying “Those faeries must not be let loose into the world of humans”.
