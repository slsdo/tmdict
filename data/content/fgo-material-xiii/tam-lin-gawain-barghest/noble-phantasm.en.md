An enormous blow using a blazing horn, the “Fae Sword Galatine”. The horns on Barghest’s forehead are antennae that restrain her body’s Saint Graph growth; by pulling these out, Barghest’s sense of reason perishes, and the instincts left behind become the sole driving force of her flesh.
Having pulled her horns out, Barghest “returns to her ancestral state”; clad in black flames, her fae body grows in size, and she brings Galatine down on the enemy camp.
The blazing flames rising from the ground could be seen as the fangs of a predator crushing the enemy between its teeth.
