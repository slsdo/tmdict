### Numeral of the Saint: B

A skill copied from Heroic Spirit Gawain of the Pan-Human History.
In the morning, while the Sun shines down on her, Barghest’s basic abilities are drastically increased.

### Wild Rule: A

Proof of being the Fang Clan’s top predator. Lord Black Dog’s true ability.
One who protects the law of nature and enjoys its blessings. Wild Rule takes survival of the fittest as its main principle and asserts dominating the frail race of humans as something natural.
Fae Sword Galatine—Barghest’s own horns turned into a weapon—predates on the flesh of those it crushed between its teeth and turns it into Barghest’s strength.
With each attack, her HP is restored, predating on the enemy’s strengthening buffs and turning them into her own.

### Foul Weather: A

The ability Barghest gained from predating on the Great Fae inhabiting Cornwall after she bested it in single combat.
It provides a powerful damage cut to the allied camp in addition to giving them some NP charge every turn.
She acquired it out of necessity to protect her allies during a certain calamity that gave birth to a large quantity of carnivorous insects.
