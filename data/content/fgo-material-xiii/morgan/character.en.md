### Personality

A cruel queen who believes only in her own power. She is capable of trusting others but she’ll never rely on them. Her first priority is the lawful domination of the British Isles and she will eliminate anyone who hinders its implementation.

She hates humans, hates fae, hates the weak, hates the ugly, hates peace, and hates equality. From the citizens’ perspective, she’s evil incarnate.

But to her, “hated” doesn’t mean “unneeded”, it means simply “incompatible with herself”. To Morgan, justice means “when I’m in control” and evil means “when someone tries to disrupt my control”. Therefore, her personal likes and dislikes are unrelated to her rules of good and evil. If someone she hates is necessary for her control, she will accept and allow them. Her extreme and absolute criteria make her look like a heartless machine.

However, Morgan does have a heart. It’s just that she can no longer feel intense bouts of joy, sadness, anger, hatred, or any form of love. The long years of single-mindedly defending Faerie Britain froze Morgan’s heart. Only one flame of passion remains lit in her chest—the wish that kept her past self athirst. The purpose of ruling Britain is the only thing still driving her.

…She had a different, more humanlike dream as a child, but her long journey taught her one fact: the woman named Morgan was born to be this and nothing else.

The Pan-Human Morgan was the living image of a villainess: lecherous, ruthless, egotistic. But for the clever Morgan of this Lostbelt, those traits cooled down. At this point, she already lost interest in sexual pleasures, the excitement of making others suffer, and the thrill of imposing her will on others. But cooling down doesn’t mean wearing off, so it is not impossible that, if she’s ever driven to a corner, the ruthlessness and evil habits that define Morgan could reoccur.

Also, because she had mixed human and fairy blood, and because she was given too many roles to play, the Pan-Human Morgan developed multiple personalities when she became an adult, allowing her to switch between three major roles.
Morgan, the good big sister who supported her little sister Arthuria.
Vivian, the lake faerie who loved the planet.
Fata Morgana, scion of Britain, the evil queen attempting to control humanity.

It’s not hard to imagine how much these conflicting roles twisted and tormented Morgan.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The queen ruling a Lostbelt: Faerie Britain. The Servant summoned by Beryl Gut. The first one summoned was the Pan-Human Morgan, but circumstances led her to hand over all the data that composed her to another copy of herself in the distant past, the Morgan created in the Lostbelt, thus resulting in her erasure. Lostbelt Morgan received information on Pan-Human Morgan’s obsession and its conclusion and gained a new purpose—to obtain Britain. That is the origin of this Faerie Queen Morgan.

Later, she built Camelot the Sin Capital, and oppressed and tormented humans and fae for 2000 years. She’s a faerie of the highest grade and a divinely talented mage who learned Rhongomyniad, the lance on the edges of the world, as a form of magecraft.

The Morgan from this Lostbelt is, like Arthuria Caster, an Avalon le Fae dispatched from the Inner Sea of Planet (the utopia) to correct Earth’s surface texture. She worked hard for millennia to mediate the conflict-minded fae and bring peace to the British Isles but was met with constant betrayal and constant despair. And when the fae were finally exterminated by their own foolishness, Morgan’s heart froze. “If no one is willing to listen to the songs of harmony, if you can only live by hating others, then you need no peace. I will rule. I will rebuild MY Britain.” In an act of reckless desperation, Morgan collected all the magical energy in Lostbelt Britain’s world tree (the Fantasy Tree), made it her own, and summoned all the dead fae, reviving them. And on top of that, she waged war against the 6 Faerie Clans and won. She built Camelot the Capital of Sin and became the absolute monarch ruling Britain for the next 2000 years.

She was initially a saint burdened with the duty to save the nation. Later, she became a tyrant ruling by force. A sovereign who protects all her eyes can see while hating everything she protects. That’s the origin of an iron queen, cold-blooded but not cruel, a slaughterer but not blood-crazed.

### Morgan in Pan-Human History

In Pan-Human Story, Igraine, a lass from Tintagel, became pregnant with a faerie baby—the daughter of the British Isles. Later, she became Arthuria’s sister on paper (Morgan’s mother Igraine married King Uther). Arthuria was nothing but a human king blueprinted and manufactured by human beings. Morgan knew she was the true king inheriting Britain’s arcane traditions, and this knowledge eventually led her to hate her father King Uther, her sister Arthuria, and the humans who wouldn’t follow her. This was a major cause of Britain’s collapse. Due to her supernatural birth, she had three mixed stances as a human, as a faerie, and as the avatar of Britain; and eventually isolated them into three independent personas. Her human identity became Morgan, Arthuria’s good sister. Her faerie identity became Vivian, the lake faerie. Her avatar of Britain identity became Morgan le Fae (Fata Morgana).

In Pan-Human History, she gave birth to many children, producing Knights of the Round Table. Gawain, Gaheris, Gareth, and Aggravain were Morgan’s children with the Orkney king, and Mordred is a homunculus made to defeat Arthuria, created from Arthuria’s semen and blood.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She looks after them as the mage who summoned her. 
She takes no issue with her Master’s level of skill. Because from Morgan’s perspective, a first-class and a third-class are equally human mages—hopelessly inferior creatures.
Thus, Morgan sees herself as the one above.
She is the king and her Master is merely her vassal… or her husband/wife.
Her feelings toward her Master are comparable to her feelings toward her tools.
She holds no gratitude or special attachment.
That said… sometimes a dollar store tool can become someone’s favorite.
It would make sense for someone with a life as harsh as hers to get a bigger kick from an ultra-class lucky event. For example, a freebie toy ring from a temple’s summer festival can be something one never forgets their whole life.

### Dialogue Examples

The same faces as always? You bore me. You truly do. I will not pardon any of you. I will not save any of you. Never forget. Every last pebble in Britain belongs to me. Know that Faerie Britain has no future without my protection.
Then come hither. I’ll put an end to your foolish fate. Arthuria. The one who was my nemesis in Pan-Human History. You can’t go anywhere. You can’t change anything. So you have my mercy. If you can’t change anything, I will. It’s time to return to being a village lass. You will never reach the Grounds of Selection.
A dream of ruin I never woke up from. It has no recompense and no salvation. The bird on the edges of the world will continue to sing of a tomorrow. Please give me a guidepost—Roadless Camelot!

### Historical Image · Character Image

Older English faerie history portrayed her as a good lake faerie, but since the Arthurian legends started to be compiled, she began to be described as the evil woman antagonizing King Arthur.
She was the daughter of the Duke of Tintagel with Igraine and later became King Arthur’s sister due to Igraine marrying King Uther. She plotted various evil schemes out of jealousy toward Arthur. She stole the Holy Sword’s scabbard, tempted Lancelot, had physical relationships with Arthur to birth the bastard son Mordred, made her sons infiltrate the Round Tables, etc.
The fall of Arthur’s kingdom had multiple causes, but Morgan’s scheming definitely gave the final push toward it.

However, at the same time, a facet of Morgan is seen defending Arthur.
She is regarded as the same individual as Vivian, the faerie who gave Arthur the Holy Sword and who guarded him after his death.

### Role within the Game

Appears in Lostbelt No. 6: Avalon le Fae, Domain of the Faerie Round Table. She’s the evil queen who rules Britain. The British Isles under her control are all that matters to her and she couldn’t care less about protecting mankind. Plot position-wise, she’s not evil but not good either. She’s simply an enemy to mankind. A powerful enemy to be defeated, a Lostbelt King that can’t settle things with dialogue. Never not in conflict with Chaldea’s attempts to restore Pan-Human History’s future.

### Connections with Characters

#### Arthuria Caster

“Among all generations of Avalon le Fae, none must have been as foolish, as stubborn, and as fortunate as her. Because regardless of what it took to get there, in her last moments, she saw the ideal star none of us ever reached.”

#### Habetrot

“She is one of the very few wonderful things in Pan-Human History. Don’t let yourself forget that.”

#### Mordred

“We sometimes pass by each other in the hallways, and every time we do, she passes by me gnawing her teeth with an expression that can be interpreted as either hatred, resignation, or sadness. It’s almost vexing that I have nothing I can say to her.”

#### Gawain, Gareth

“Both knights are like undistorted rays of sunshine. There was more to the Pan-Human Morgan than just vengefulness, and those two can be taken as proof of that.”

#### Barghest

“She’s my most trusted Faerie Knight. Her tendency to prioritize the jobs no one wants to do is very deserving of praise. Even Aesc the Savior would have applauded her contributions in the battle against a certain Calamity.”

#### Baobhan Sith

“Yes, she is my daughter and the successor to Faerie Britain’s throne. Are you raising any objections? The fae can’t obey someone without a vicious personality, and when their abilities grow too great, they stop obeying even me. Her lack of ability won’t be a problem. I’ll make all the Mystic Codes she needs to have Faerie Britain in the palm of her hands.”

#### Melusine

“The strongest knight in Faerie Britain, no matter the form of combat. I gifted her the name Lancelot as proof of that. Our relationship was supposed to be one on equal terms… but I made her my vassal in order to free her from the fate she’s cursed with. And she seems to hold some respect for me. Therefore, she follows my orders. But ultimately, respect is not what she’s a martyr to.

It was love that made the dragon carcass crash to the ground.”

#### Aesc

“—I’ll save her story for another occasion.”
