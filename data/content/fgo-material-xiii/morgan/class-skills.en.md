### Magic Resistance: A

Due to being a faerie, Morgan is clad in supernatural arcanity. The might of supernatural phenomena caused by formulaic spells is greatly reduced on her.

### Item Crafting: EX

Fae don’t need Mystic Codes, but due to Morgan’s origins, she manufactured many magical items. Some magical items are in the centuries or millennia class, including the Garden of Lost Will and the Transporting Water Mirror.

### Territory Construction: B

Her talent for building a workshop stops at “almost a genius” territory, perhaps because lacks her own Faerie Domain. Her castle, Camelot the Capital of Sin, was built using the power of the Faerie Clans, but the throne serving as its cornerstone and the twelve Holy Lances are Morgan’s own creations. Those are categorized as Weapons, not as Territory.

### Glam Sight: A

She once had eyes capable of perceiving the truth but now she lost them. That said, her eyes are still vastly more arcane than human eyes.

### Mad Enhancement: B

Past events led her to distort her own attributes—the policies necessary for her survival—so she could rule as queen. The labors she put herself through to preserve Faerie Britain can only be described as insane.
