### Athirst Charisma: B

The governing power of one who, after many instances of failure, dejection, and despair, chose to dominate by fear. 
She ignites her Faerie Reactor to generate energy, increase the whole party’s Attack, and lower all enemies’ Defense.

### Faerie from Avalon: C

Blessings from the lake fae. Fills one target’s NP gauge and increases NP generation for the whole party.
Its rank is lowered due to how long she’s been away from home.

### From the Edges of the World: A

The pride of the queen who returned from the verge of death numerous times, withstood the curse of world termination at the edges of the world, and returned to Britain.
A powerful whirl of curses that defines who wins and who loses on the battlefield. The embodiment of the winter storm. When the turn starts, she gets 1-time Guts (can’t overlap with other Guts), lowers all enemies’ Attack and Luck, focuses stars on herself, and gives herself a crit damage buff.
The enemy forces spend 3 turns in a disadvantageous environment that can only be described as a storm. Her Skill as a Lostbelt King, which the regular Morgan doesn’t have.
