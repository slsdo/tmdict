While preparing the project proposal for part 2, I drew a draft of her and ArCas together, and it was solidified since then that this was how I wanted to design her. The concept for her was pretty much exactly what you’re seeing on the screen: a witch resembling Arthuria. I aimed for some soft contrasts… Dark but almost invisible, cold but seductive. My favorite spots are the spikes on her 3rd Ascension’s throat and chest. Morgan’s first appearance was in Fate/Apocrypha’s anime, and her design there was a remix of my first draft. We covered her face with a veil there because we couldn’t have that version of the design look too memorable, but later we reflected that element on her Winter Queen design. Since she’s a character who doesn’t change her face much, I paid extra detailed attention to the emotions expressed through her eyes when finalizing her sprites. Shimokoshi did her weapons. He designed many versions to fulfill my request to make her feel heavily armed and overwhelming. (Takeuchi Takashi)
