The soul state that the Losbelt King Morgan inherited from the Pan-Human Morgan.
Throughout her whole life, Morgan wished to conquer Camelot, the Castle of White Walls, but ultimately couldn’t.
The very laws of the world (that is, the Human Order) prevented Morgan from becoming king of Britain. Her unrealized wish eventually turned into lamentation and later hatred.
Twisted hunger for control and a sense of privilege. Burning homesickness and anger against humanity.
Later, her hatred against Arthuria, one equal to her who was allowed to sit on the throne of Camelot, turned Morgan into the one who ruins Camelot.
This is a magecraft that embodies what she became. Morgan attempts revenge by destroying all roads to where she can’t reach.

The one Morgan means to defeat isn’t King Arthur.
She returned from the edges of the world and became a world-cursing witch to overthrow the fate that once attempted to exterminate the fae of the British Isles for humanity’s benefit: Human Order itself.
