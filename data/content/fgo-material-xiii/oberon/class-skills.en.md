### Territory Creation: E-

The ability to create one’s own workshop and territory as a mage.
Formerly the king of the Faerie Forest, he lost his domain over time, becoming nothing more than a wanderer in a story.
Hence his Territory Creation skill being the lowest rank possible.
Paradoxically, the skill shows that Oberon is now a king in name only.
Oberon keeps this a secret, and does his best to avoid revealing that his Territory Creation ability is ranked low.

### Item Construction: A+

The ability to create items.
He is a high-ranking craftsman when it comes to items that deceive the mind, such as the Tricolored Grass Dew, which managed to curse even Faerie Queen Titania.

### Riding: A

In English faerie lore, faeries are said to travel by riding insects.
Since Oberon is a king, he travels gracefully using his own wings, but when he is out of the public eye, he rides a hawk moth (at speeds of 130 km/h), racing through the land and guiding people’s hearts and minds.

### Divinity: ―

Oberon’s queen, Titania, is a faerie created as a composite of various faeries and goddesses (Mab, Diana, Titan), possessing divinity as a result. But since Oberon is the Faerie King without any elements mixed in, he has not acquired divinity.

### Fae Eyes: ―

These are not Mystic Eyes that humans possess, but are rather a type of vision that fae are born with that allows them to “alter worlds.”
These eyes, which see through all lies and reveal truths, allow Oberon to clearly see the malice, weakness, and nature of intelligent beings.
