### Night Veil: EX

Night falls, bringing great success to the party and increasing their will to fight by escaping reality.
Almost identical to Merlin’s Dreamlike Charisma.

### Morning Lark: EX

Morning breaks, greatly uplifting one’s spirits and raising their self-esteem.
A forced doping for a short period of time. It rapidly increases the NP of the targeted individual and causes them to gain a large amount of motivation (in the form of critical stars), but the individual will become rapidly exhausted after and lose NP. Use with care…

### Dream’s End: EX

A dream of the end times. An enhancement skill applied to a single target. The affected Servant will gain an unparalleled rise in strength, but at the end of the turn they will lose all of its effects and fall into an eternal sleep.

―――Those who have lost their dreams,
Shall never gain the strength to wake up to reality again.

(Eternal sleep…also nullifies revival effects like Guts. Instead of the target exiting the party like a sacrifice, they will remain in the party as dead weight that wastes a slot. Worst demerit ever.)
