Lai Rhyme Goodfellow.
A counting-out rhyme of an imaginary paradise as told (fabricated) by Oberon.
The wings on his back unfurl and scatter scales everywhere, forcibly transforming the target’s body (Spirit Origin) into a spiritual body in the dream world, preventing the target from functioning in the real world. A Greater Magic that is superficially similar to a Reality Marble (just like Nero’s Golden Theater).
Those who fall trap into this dream become Invincible in exchange for being unable to intervene in the real world.
