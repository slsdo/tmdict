### Appearance

A lean, handsome man with porcelain skin, silver hair, and gentle blue eyes.
He is the very image of a faerie prince straight out of a fairy tale.
As a faerie, he has insect wings growing out from his back, but the type of wing changes as his Spirit Origin ascends.
(At first, his wings exude peace, warmth and fairness as expected of the Faerie King, but as his Spirit Origin ascends and his true identity is revealed, his wings take on a threatening appearance.)

### Personality

The perfect prince, who looks like he came straight out of a fairy tale. A handsome man of light.
To put it simply, he is a cunning good-looking guy, the main character of the story.
He has a mature smile yet retains his youthful mannerisms; he possesses the authority and power of an adult despite being an innocent visionary. What a joke.

He is educated but doesn’t boast about it.
He pursues lofty ideals but doesn’t force them on others.
He is weak but does not depend on violence.
He is the greatest and hottest prince in all of faerie history, but he will not take on a wife.

In other words, he is an idol in faerie society.
Kinda like being the president of the humanities club and the cheerful leader of a sports team at the same time.

He describes himself as a mild-mannered, eager and kind-hearted pacifist.
“I like being happy. Just as insects need clean water to live, faeries need happiness to survive.”
“Which is why, out-of-character it may be, I’m taking the initiative to make things around me better. Because that’s what makes me happy.”
“Ultimately, I’m doing this for my own happiness. Don’t worry about lending and borrowing and all that merchant stuff. It’s better for our relationship that way (grin).”

Because of his thoughtful nature, he is cautious when it comes to creating and executing his plans, but he never misses a chance to set them into motion. He dominates the situation with bullish aggression (or savagery, depending on how you look at it).

“There aren’t many people out there who can explain everything about who they are.”
“It’s a different story if you somehow have an instruction manual like you would a tool, but we’re living beings. Living beings are ill-defined by their very nature.”
“But everyone has at least one thing they think is good about themselves, as embarrassing as it may be to say it out loud.”
“To give an example, I don’t think I’m a coward, maybe.”
(Not being a coward doesn’t equate to being brave. In Oberon’s case, it means he has no fear.)

### Attitude towards Master

The sole helper from Pan-Human History who assisted and guided Chaldea and Master on their journey throughout Faerie Britain.
To the Master he was like an older brother, a friend, and occasionally a strict teacher, and he continued to look after the Master’s spirits in their ongoing struggles.

Summoned as a Servant, Oberon (as a playable unit) acts as a guardian to support his Master, while keeping his basic aspects hidden.
He is Merlin’s associate and rival in terms of performance and character.

### Dialogue Examples

“Have you heard of Oberon the Faerie King? That’s my name. Hehe, pretty cool, right?”
“If we can talk it out, by all means let’s do so! Who needs weapons or logistics when talking is not only faster and cheaper? Best of all, we can hear everyone’s true thoughts! How fun, I love the idea!”
“Enemies aren’t meant to be defeated, but to be pitted against one another. You don’t want to put everyone’s lives at risk, do you?”
“That’s right. What’s impossible in reality isn’t impossible in fantasy. And humans have always made their fantasies come true. The future that seems all but a dream will eventually cease to be one☆”
“What was it you were looking for again?”
“A star. A star that’ll forever be beyond my reach.”
“Even though you said it doesn’t exist here?”
“You think because something doesn’t exist means people won’t look for it? You’ve got it all wrong. We search because it doesn’t exist. We can’t help but seek what can never be. That’s what my queen, Titania, is to me. She’s no different than the stars twinkling in the sky. Because no matter how hard we try, those of us here on Earth may never have one for ourselves.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The Faerie King in Shakespeare’s play, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
He has a falling out with his queen Titania over her new changeling, and in retaliation, he uses a potion that makes a person fall in love with the first thing they see when they wake up so he could take possession of the changeling. Although he is described as being extremely powerful, he is a selfish and childish character.
Unlike Titania, who was Shakespeare’s creation, Oberon appears in another source. In the 15th century poem, “Huon de Bordeaux,” he is portrayed as a king ruling over the faerie forest, and a magic user with the ability to grant all wishes.

His name can also be read as Auberon.
Originally a figure in Germanic folklore, he has appeared in legends across various countries, perhaps because of the power his name holds or the ease in which it could be used.
In “Nibelungenlied,” he appears as a dwarf faerie king, and in the French romance, “Huon de Bordeaux,” a three-foot-tall faerie as an incarnation of nature.
Due to these various folk tales, Oberon is often referred to as the Faerie King in theatrical plays, and Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” seems to have entrenched this epithet.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Oberon first appears in Chapter 6 of Part 2, “Fae Round Table Domain, Avalon le Fae.”
In contrast to the Faerie Knights under Morgan’s command who treat humans like livestock and playthings, Oberon is a prince who unites the fundamentalist faerie clans living in harmony with nature.
He is also allied with the humans gathered in the ruins of Londinium.

He introduces himself as a Heroic Spirit from Pan-Human History, a Servant summoned to Britain one step ahead of Chaldea, fighting for the oppressed humans and faeries.
However, there was no way Oberon could achieve his goal on his own, and so he waited in anticipation for the powerful and final actor, the main character, to enter the scene.

A dependable ally who flits between the three forces as he pleases from Act 1 to the finale, making each force fight against one another to lead the player to victory and save Britain.

The Autumn Forest is located on the outskirts of Faerie Britain (Wales).
It is inhabited by powerless insect faeries, tiny faeries who were unable to assimilate with the faeries in Faerie Britain and their mimicry of human society, due to their innocence and low intelligence. It was in that forest that they recruited Oberon, so he took the throne to protect Faerie Britain’s weak faeries despite being a Heroic Spirit from Pan-Human History.

### Faeries of the Autumn Forest

Ostracized faeries would wander the outskirts of Faerie Britain and establish settlements.
Examples include the Nameless Forest, where the Mystery of “Loss” has enveloped the entire forest after the Lord of Cornwall, Foul Weather, was obliterated, and the Autumn Forest, where the trees and vegetation are perpetually in a withered state.
Oberon became the Faerie King of the Autumn Forest, but there was originally a queen who ruled over the weaker faeries.

Her name was Blanca. An ancient faerie who inhabited the Autumn Forest.
She is said to be a princess of a clan who was transformed into her current form via curse, or a faerie who drifted into the Lostbelt from Pan-Human History, but no one knows the truth.
This snow white moth faerie, in exchange for being born speechless, is not corrupted by the Autumn Forest’s stagnation (like humans, she is not poisoned by gossip and rumors).

The only blessing Blanca had given the faeries of the Autumn Forest was “live to fight another day.” Though she did her best to keep to herself, positioning herself in the branches of the tall trees and watching over the forest day by day.
It wasn’t until Oberon appeared in the Autumn Forest that she left the treetops and began to appear in front of others.

### General Armaments

Basically, he uses his bare hands…but he doesn’t really hold his arm out and perform supernatural abilities.
He focuses on rather crude close combat (kneeling on the ground, rolling around, closing in on his opponent), using various weapons made from dead insects.
Examples include Hippolyta’s spear (but shaped like a bow), Theseus’s armor (but shaped like a spear), and Heracles’ loincloth (but shaped like dual-wielding daggers).
