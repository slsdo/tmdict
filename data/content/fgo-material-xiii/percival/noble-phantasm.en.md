Longinus Count Zero.
A holy lance, said to have pierced the chest of Christ.
When its True Name is unleashed, Longinus demonstrates the true might that Sir Balin once displayed against his battle with King Pellam. It functions as an Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm that can demolish even a royal castle (believed to be the Corbenic, the Grail castle).
It is a terrifying and destructive Noble Phantasm that can also greatly heal any target.

The holy lance has two restraints placed on it by Galahad and Balin. This can be considered a downgraded version of the Thirteen Seals placed on Rhongomyniad, the holy lance wielded by the King of Knights (or Excalibur, the holy sword wielded by the King of Knights from another dimension).
