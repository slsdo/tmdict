### Personality

A faithful guardian knight who values decorum.
He has sometimes been described as pure of heart.
He remains calm without doubting or losing his temper at others.
He is well-liked by children and animals that meet him for the first time, though said person is unaware of this fact.
During his lifetime, he often stood in Camelot’s garden in the morning sunlight, with small birds perched on his shoulders and arms.

It is during battle that he shows a harsher side of himself.
But only during battle.

He is the type of person who can stand to be around Agravain.

A very caring person.
He especially fusses over his juniors. This is because he genuinely wants to protect and nurture the youth so they may grow up to become outstanding heroes.
In the Round Table, he doted on the young Gareth, Squire Bors, Sir Lancelot’s son Galahad, and others.

“Sir Percival is more of a big brother to me than my actual big brothers,”

Gareth once declared with a smile when she was still alive.
――― Hearing these words after Gareth’s death, Percival stood in the now-empty garden of Camelot, shedding a single tear.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He wants to take care of the Master as well.
If they’re running low on food, he will immediately bring them another serving.
For example, if the Master is training or out in the field carrying out their mission, he will get close and stand by their side.

### Dialogue Examples

“Removing dual restraints on the holy lance. Begin countdown.”
“Master, I hope you’re not hungry. You won’t even win the easy battles if you’re famished. Don’t think of it as a chore.”
“I was unable to obtain the Holy Grail, but I certainly witnessed something that I consider precious. It was the light that Galahad possessed, the hope that points to the future… I believe in it. Even to this day.”
“Gareth. You’re still thin as a stick. You need to eat more. Come on, eat up…”
“Gareth. Why are you running away? Gareth!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

One of King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table in Britain. He holds the second seat at the Round Table.
Percival de Galles.
An honorable knight, occasionally referred to as an innocent fool.
Percival is an expert spearman, a knight who personally witnessed the miracle of the Holy Grail, and a man of compassion who has saved numerous lives. He also safeguards Longinus, another holy lance differing from the one possessed by the King of Knights.

The Holy Grail was destined to be summoned to heaven together with Galahad,
Whereas the sacred lance Longinus was destined to remain on earth.
In this story rendition, Sir Percival is said to be the one who brought back the holy lance.

Percival the Knight also makes an appearance in Wagner’s last opera, “Parsifal.”
In this opera, he is depicted as the person who recovers and inherits the holy lance.

### General Armaments

Longinus is his Noble Phantasm.
However, it is sealed when used as a normal weapon.
When its true name is released, the seal is lifted and the holy lance will transform into its true form.

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria

Our King of Knights.
She is a strong, unwavering individual, but has a rather slender figure. Perhaps I should double her serving portions? But that would be disrespectful. No, wait…
Who knew I would meet my king again in Chaldea of all places…but she seems to have lost some weight?
That is unacceptable!

#### Georgios

(A fellow comrade of the same German faith, with whom I can have a quiet conversation with.)

#### Bedivere

He is truly a loyal knight.
He once used to be a flower covered in thorns, but now those thorns are nowhere to be seen.
Like a nameless violet flower ―――

#### Gawain / Agravain / Gaheris / Gareth

Our fathers once fought one another bitterly.
It was a very tragic event. I feel sorry about it even to this day.
I must double the siblings’ serving portions again tonight.
――― Especially Gareth’s.
She could have been a great knight.
Even if she has already died once…it does not matter.
Who can deny the radiance of what may come tomorrow?

#### Mordred

Something must have happened to him too.
But he’s wearing far less clothing than I’ve seen him wear back in Camelot.
A strip of vermilion cloth wrapped around his chest ―――
……
……
Huh?
Oh?
Uh-huh.
Mmm.
So…Mordred is a woman…not a man?
I see.
So that’s how it is.
Hahaha. Oh, I just remembered something about my past in Britain. I used to thump his…or her, rather…back really hard like she was my little brother.
Yeah.
Hmm?
――― I-isn’t that unbecoming of a knight!?
No wait, Mordred is also a Knight of the Round Table.
Gender is irrelevant when it comes to loyalty and friendship. Just look at Gareth!
Wait, but Mordred is also known as the Knight of Treachery…
……
……
I wonder…what happened.

#### Lancelot

A friend who I sometimes crossed paths and went on adventures with.
I still remember the good old days. They were good memories.
…and that you killed many people to save the queen from captivity. Among those you killed was Gareth, who looked up to you.

#### Tristan / Caesar / Odysseus

Cheating. Is. Bad.

#### Melusine

The lady said to be older sister of Lostbelt Percival.
That Percival and I are different people ―――
But some things can be passed on.
That’s why I was able to speak with her naturally, even if it was only for a brief moment.
To the Master who made this possible, I give my thanks.

#### Merlin

The great illustrious mage.
I wonder, what does he usually eat?

#### Mash

A child with deep ties to Galahad.
You could even say she is a new recruit of the Knights of the Round Table.
She’s a bit on the thin side though…okay, I’ll have to tell the cafeteria staff to double her portion size!

#### Arthur Pendragon

……? (baffled)
