I tried to make someone with an unpleasant personality, but still pitiable, cute, and who could die at any moment, but would you look at that, it turned out all fae are unpleasant, pitiable, cute, and die quickly!!!! I’m so mad!!!! But I still think I drew her adorable~ I was reconstructing Kazuradrop’s base for her, so I envisioned her wings as a middle ground between bug and bird wings. (Wada Arco)
