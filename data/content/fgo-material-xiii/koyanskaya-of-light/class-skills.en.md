### Riding: B

Talent for riding. As a woman who rides the trends and eras, she can do a pretty decent job.

### Divinity: -

Everyone in the Tamamo genus has this, but Koyanskaya lost hers when she fell into Beasthood.

### Independent Action: EX

Surprisingly and terrifyingly enough, Koyanskaya of Light doesn’t need a Master. She abides by her Master’s Command Spell for a single reason: her pride telling her she’ll never break a promise or contract.

### Independent Manifestation: C

The proof that she’s a SPY. Drifter abilities. Due to her Beast traits, Koyanskaya can visit any alternative world or alternative reality. When Koyanskaya was a Larval Beast, she could use this Skill to freely move between Lostbelts and the blank Earth, but due to the big rank down on this Skill, she can’t move as freely as she previously could.

### Morph: A

This was originally a Skill to raise defense, but Koyanskaya uses it as her favorite tool for SPY activity.

### Nega-Weapon: -

The Nega Skill she had when she was a Larval Beast. It currently falls under the “Aptitude for Slaughter (Gun)” label so she can show off how she’s not a Beast anymore.
