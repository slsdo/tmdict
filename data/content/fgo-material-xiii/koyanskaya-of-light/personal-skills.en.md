### Innovator Bunny: A

The Authority to improve profit-making systems and creates cycles dedicated solely to tormenting (exploiting) humans… or so she claims with the smuggest shit-eating grin on her face. It’s actually just a hobby and a talent of hers.

A Skill of rule by fear only one step away from corporate slavery. It expands vitality (NP) and heals physical fatigue (Skill Charge) for the business support target.

This excessive scene of “the helped party is at max motivation but one step away from hell” can be a little exhausting for those watching it. Bunnies are scary.

### Aptitude for Slaughter (Human): A

A variation of a personal Skill of Archimedes, the founder of mathematics.

Archimedes accidentally created massacre weapons that surpassed the state-of-the-art weaponry of his time, but Koyanskaya gained this Skill on purpose.

The Skill allows her to use any weapon used by humanity from the era she’s in, and the weapons become multiple times more powerful than they were in human hands and able to instantly perform the natural cycle of retributive justice (karma normally takes it slow, occurring liberally through the span of a few centuries).

Fitting for a former Larval Beast, this Skill represents the fact that, on paper, mankind doesn’t stand a chance against her in this era.

That said, this Skill serves only to assert dominance over mankind, so it’s not nearly that absolute of a Skill against Servants or Monsters.

It gives her a disgustingly powerful super-effectiveness against humans.

### NFF Special: A

The highest level of the Morph Skill, also called Goddess Metamorphosis (Gun). She transforms into Koyanskaya Weapon, the goddess of firearms. Not to be confused with Kiara’s and Summer Tamamo’s versions of Goddess Metamorphosis. Amazing Buster buffs, just for you.
