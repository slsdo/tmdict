### Personality (1st~2nd Ascension)

A captivating beauty who bewitchingly leads humans around by the nose, following her policies of free and uncontrolled wildness. She has a preference for befriending (forming alliances with) the strong and tormenting the weak, but that’s simply a demonstration of what beasts are always doing in the natural food chain. She’s a voluptuous beauty, but her sexuality is merely one of her weapons. She’s an intelligent adult woman who always looks at the bigger picture before acting.

She regards all human activity as filthy, but that doesn’t mean she dislikes any of it. Some things are only fun because they’re dirty. Indeed, entertainment, games, and business.

“If the task were simply to wipe out the human race, I’m far from the only one who can do it. I’m born from the evil of cherishment. Keep in mind that my grudges aren’t shallow enough for me simply settle our debts of sin and leave♡”

As you can see, due to her personality demanding her to enjoy everything she does, her attacks on mankind are very roundabout. After considering many possible ways to make mankind taste its own medicine, she reached a conclusion: “Perhaps keeping them under their cherished pet’s management and gradually degrading them is my most humiliating and most perverse option.” And so she chose to trail the path of a goddess of weaponry, what mankind deserves to be ruled by.

Due to her great amount of pride as someone who lives in the wild, she is upright about repaying profits with profits, no matter who she gained them from, and always keeping promises. During Part 1.5, she worked in human society as a business consultant, and this personality of hers was the cause of her success.

### Personality (3rd Ascension)

Her base character is still the same, but awakening completely as a god brings her conduct and sense of humor closer to the Tamamo no Mae she copies from. Meaning she’s cheerful. And cute.

### Setting

One of the two Koyanskaya halves split when the Larval Beast was erased. Koyanskaya of Light. The side that is more lenient on humanity and respects Human Order slightly more than she did back when she was pretending to be an Apostle of the Alien God. She’s a Tamamo no Mae with no marriage aspirations (ignore the point that she’s not really Tamamo no Mae for a moment). Her aspects a sovereign and a divine (nature) spirit are stronger.

A Beast is an evil born from the karma produced by mankind’s progress, and Koyanskaya, as a previous Beast IV candidate, is no exception. Within our categories of beings oppressed/persecuted by mankind and beings used by mankind for oppression/persecution, Koyanskaya falls under the “used for oppression/persecution” side… Simply put, she became a Divine Spirit encompassing all the murder tools created by mankind. In her Third Ascension, she pays homage to the culture that originated Tamamo no Mae by referring to herself as the Greater Goddess of Weaponry Ikusautsuwa-no-Oomikami.

Despite having changed her attribute to Light, she’s still just as much of a misanthrope. Her stance is to dunk on mankind for pushing their luck too far, but without needing to go as far as wiping out the species.

She’s an amalgam of the suffering of the animals and the one who delivers their warning. While she’s a pseudo-deified retaliation mechanism of the natural world, she has a strong demand for entertainment value, probably due to being modeled after Tamamo no Mae. “I’ll get the job done, but I need a little bit of fun in my life☆”

Also, despite the symmetry she has with Koyanskaya of Light as beings of opposite natures, they have one thing in common. No matter how much she gains enmity against humanity and loses her marriage aspirations, Tamamo no Mae’s servile nature never goes away.

By the way, she is a Bunny, not a Fox.

### Attitude towards Contractor

Her stance is to grant their superficial desires while cleverly trampling their essential hopes (dreams for the future, ideal self, etc). Any human who contracts this version of Koyanskaya will be successful and enjoy every day of their lives, but will ultimately lose everything, fall into despair, and become a dejected failure.
However, now that Koyanskaya learned that her purpose in life is to watch her Master realize that all the pampering made them lose their chance to become their ideal self, she’ll get her Master back in their original state so that she can savor her life purpose again.

That’s the start of an infinite loop of setback→motivation→setback→motivation. Who wins and who loses, in the end, depends on that Master’s social grace.

### Attitude towards Master

Chaldea’s Master is a revenge target, but she never forgets she’s grateful for them saving her. That’s because animals don’t change their creeds depending on who they’re talking to.
She’s not a Servant allied to Chaldea (humanity), she’s a Servant allied to Chaldea’s Master. If Chaldea’s Master dies, she’ll quickly either vanish or return to being an enemy of humanity.

### Dialogue Examples

A mysterious beauty who saw the crisis in the Human Order, who raced through the jungle on her beloved motorcycle, and who wiped out the Ocelomeh giving them a free demo of the best the rifle industry has to offer---Yes, it was none other than I. Tamamaovich Koyanskaya, at your service♡
No…my Beni… my sweet Beni…I can’t take seeing her looking like thaaaaat! I’m going back to Tunguskaaaaa!
If I may have your attention, everyone! Behold these gallant turrets, this doughty chassis, this torrential downpour of missiles. Do you see it now? You are all no match for me!
Very well. I’ll authorize your audience. The mountains form ravines deep, earth-shaking events startle heavens alike, rumble the great mountains in much ado about nothing, for both the greater kami in the heavens and the local gods of the lands. As such, my Soul Dress shakes the heavens. May the cries of the sun crows and moon rabbits be the new prayer of countless rites!

### Extra

Koyanskaya of Light is a misanthrope but that doesn’t mean she hates every human being.

KoL: “Believe it or not, I don’t hate every human being. There’s at least one exception.”
MC: “For real?! What’re they like?”
KoL: “He’s Hugh Hefner.”
MC: “Who?”

Hugh Hefner is the founder of Playboy Magazine. A man who extolled sexual liberty. The man who created the first pin-up magazine in the United States. The man who stood at the pinnacle of all forms of entertainment of his era and elevated luxury to new extremes. The inventor of the bunny suit. The first man to ever trademark clothes. The man who fought against racism and other forms of prejudice despite being a wealthy bachelor. An illustrative mixture of the strength and ugliness, ambition and sinfulness, nobility and wickedness of human masculinity.
Koyanskaya has a level of admiration for him as an entrepreneur. (By the way, it’s unknown if the bunny suit in her Final Ascension is because she likes Playboy or because she is a rabbit)

The one project Hugh Hefner failed to accomplish was building a casino resort. After the success of Casino Playboy in London, he was one step away from building a resort capable of outdoing Las Vegas, but at the very end, because of a scandal from 10 years before, the government reverted his gambling permit, and mankind’s greatest entertainment district died a dream.
It’s no exaggeration to say Koyanskaya started NFF Services to fulfill this unrealized dream in Hefner’s stead. She accumulates money to ultimately built a casino city capable of outdoing Las Vegas. Koyanskaya could build the resort with magical energy if she wanted to but that would defeat the point. She believes it would only mean something if she built it under the economic systems of human society.

### General Armaments

She favors heavy artillery, keeping up with the theme of killing humans with the weapons they created. Pistols, rifles, launchers, helicopter fire, you name it.

### Connections with Characters

#### Tamamo no Mae

The Divine Spirit of Nature/animal model she used to reference back when she was a Larval Beast. When she was a Larval Beast, she copied the dark side of Tamamo no Mae, and to this day, she still considers her an example to be followed. The light/dark split didn’t change this. It’s beyond the point where she considers Tamamo no Mae her mother or older sister… she goes as far as to think “One day I’ll steal her identity and reach her Divine Rank♡”. Her boldness and calculativeness are 100% identical to Tamamo no Mae.

#### Koyanskaya of Darkness

A beast tamer with the philanthropic attributes split from Beast Koyanskaya. She’s her other self but feels more like a sister. Light fully inherited her facet as a spy and NFF Services’s business philosophies, while Dark got her passion for human management and showmanship.

#### Taigong Wang

“What got me off my rocker in Tunguska was him comparing me to another woman, not his ’Meh, it’s not Daji’ attitude.”, she claims. That said, Koyanskaya of Light is not as mad at Taigong as Dark is.

#### Beni-Enma

Koyanskaya’s eternal idol. A subject of faith and care. “For the Beast of Chewishment to fall into pet-keeping hobbies pwoves an Evil of Humanity can never amend their ways”, Mistress Beni fervently points out. This criticism makes her squeal with emotional damage and joy. There’s no saving this bunny.

#### Rasputin

A business partner she worked with when she was pretending to be an Apostle of the Alien God. The other Apostles are subjects of mockery and future enemies, but Rasputin was the only one she had a modicum of respect and admiration for. “Good or evil, all those born into this world deserve to be blessed”. This belief of Rasputin’s host is something no Beast can speak ill of. Regardless, she doesn’t like him because they’re too similar.

#### Melusine

She still can’t forget the wounds she received in Faerie Britain. Without that, she could have matured as a Beast, but with that, she could be split into Light and Darkness.

“A wish as small as a bug. My defeat was entirely caused by her last words. She was intelligent, cold-blooded, flower-like, and moderately wicked. I’ll never be able to find a business partner as great as her. —Huh? Hold on a second. That was quite the excellent monologue from me, wasn’t it?”
