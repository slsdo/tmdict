Spelled in Japanese as Reishou Juukou: Nanajuukyuu-shiki Tekika Taisha.
She summons the NF-79 Tactical Suppression Vehicle, the best weapon ever made by Tamamo Heavy Industries (an NFF subsidiary), and slaughters her enemies with it.
The NF-79 is both a vehicle and a shrine dedicated to the cult of Koyanskaya.
She claims its barrage of missiles emulates the ancient Chinese traditions of throwing fruit for beautiful people to fill their carts with.
Although the Noble Phantasm’s subtitle references the Izumo Grand Shrine, this is not meant to represent Koyansakya’s adherence to the divine virtues. It’s meant to represent her rejection of the divine virtues or her antagonism against the holy ones.
With enough time and funding, she can build a stronger shrine.
“If I’m excused from paying staff salaries and benefits next year, I’ll be able to blow up a whole space armada♡”, she claims. Don’t let her fool you.
