### Dragon Heart: B

It refers to Melusine’s Magic Circuits, the so-called dragon’s core or the dragon’s jewel.
It is an excessive manifestation of bioenergy that is classified as “Mana Burst” in the Pan-Human History.
Having reconstructed herself as a “draconic faerie”, Melusine possesses the same biological functions as a dragon despite not belonging to the dragon species.
An outstanding skill capable of providing a powerful attack buff, damage cut, increased max HP, and increased NP generation.
 
### Eternal Arms Mastery: B

A skill copied from Heroic Spirit Lancelot of the Pan-Human History. Regardless of one’s mental state, they will be able to fully display the combat techniques they have mastered. It is the combat experience that has been engraved into one’s body from excessive training…is what could be said about this, but it’s a skill that isn’t that necessary for Melusine who was born strong. Melusine hates the existence of this skill. This is because she is opposed to naturally strong creatures using techniques.
Considering the fact that she was summoned as a Servant by Chaldea, she transformed it into her unique skill “Perry Dancer” afterwards, going “It’s nice to have something like the techniques of a human since it also makes me heroine-like!”
 
### Ley Horizon: A

From the anecdote passed down in England of the dragon (mirage) protecting the “horizon” or “boundary” that serves as a gate to another world.
In the end, Melusine is just her name and vessel as a “fae folk’ and her original role is to be the “boundary” itself. It is a spiritron exchanging technique of the same principle as the rayshifting used by Chaldea.
Its effect varies depending on her ascension: in her first and second ascensions, it generates a massive amount of mana and changes the performance of her Noble Phantasm to AoE; in her third ascension, it significantly increases her Noble Phantasm’s power and turns her invulnerable by wrapping her up in the “dimensional boundary line”.
