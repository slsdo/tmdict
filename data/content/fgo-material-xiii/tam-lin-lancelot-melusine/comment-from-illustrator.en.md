Melusine’s forked eyebrows. When I read the setting I was given, I found her to be like a soul with dual natures so I chose this design in order to portray two emotions at the same time like “crying while angry”. There are many emblems and markings on her armor and casual wear, as well as her dragon form, aren’t there. Even if her origin is a dragon, she’s a fleeting existence that was born from a swamp in the end. If she does not keep defining “who she is” with her title as a knight, the name she was given, her relationship with her Master, and her markings, or if there is no one to keep loving her, she won’t be able to maintain her form and return to the mud. The humble me who just came up with that proper-sounding reason is a samurai who really loves those caution signs printed on industrial goods. (CHOCO)
