### Personality

Withdrawn, but active.
The type who gets things done, swiftly carrying out her duty while keeping her feelings concealed within.
This maiden of a knight is a clean freak who does not play around and is always cloaked in a tense atmosphere.
 
She is considered a “cruel faerie” because she classifies humans as something bad, which she mercilessly rejects, but the person in question neither detests nor considers humans below herself.
She simply perceives them as “life forms that have low ability for survival individually”.
Since Melusine herself was originally “the dragon that drowned to her death in a lake”, she does not discriminate against others using “the ability one was born with” as a pretext.
Once you find out about her true nature, you can clearly tell that she won’t reject someone without reason just because they are bad.
 
Since she is originally someone who was “thrown away and left all by herself”, she easily succumbs to loneliness and is prone to self-deprecation.
Since she recognizes herself as the strongest creature, her preferences aren’t based on whether one is strong or weak. Compared to her, everyone is a “weakling”, after all. What Melusine like is not “the courage to oppose those who are stronger”, but “the kindness to care for those who are weaker”. Or rather, she’ll cling to her Bond 5 Master going “The strong are to be obeyed. That is absolute. In other words, do as I say.”
 
A tragic knight who is fundamentally good, but because of her love for Aurora, she meets her doom.

### Setting

A member of Lostbelt Britain’s Knights of the Round Table.
The Faerie Knight assuming the Saint Graph of a knight of the Pan-Human History’s Round Table, Lancelot.
 
The sole “dragon” faerie in Lostbelt Britain.
(In reality, she is not a dragon faerie, but the terminal of a dragon)
She behaves like a proud, beautiful, and merciless knight.
Her inorganic outer skin and armor are seen as something “special” even among the Faerie Knights. (Or more like she is the only one sticking out. No matter how you look at her, she is the resident of a sci-fi universe)
 
While she might reign as Fae Land Britain’s strongest knight now and is respected by many faeries, originally, she was the lowest-class creature of the Fae Land, living in the “garbage swamp” in the northeastern lake region of the island.
She is the terminal of the dragon that missed its timing to return to the Inner Sea of the Planet and died miserably on the surface.
The dragon’s body perished and the rotten liquids of its body created a muddy swamp that polluted the forests, but a “part of its flesh” somehow survived within the swamp even while it was decomposing and lived on as a diminutive creature.
That was Melusine’s beginning.
 
While the dragon’s remnants, the “dragon skeleton”, were revered as something great and mighty, she who squirmed within the swamp this skeleton was submerged in received the resentment and hatred of the faeries.
For several thousands of long years, hers was an existence where she could do nothing but desperately operate her cells just to express that she was “alive”.
The one who saved such a girl was a person of importance from the Faerie Clans, a faerie of the Wind Clan, Aurora.
The shining Aurora. She was the most beloved girl in the world of the fae folk and was said to be number one among the faeries in terms of beauty, who needed nothing else beyond that beauty of hers.
When Aurora found a “young her” covered in mud and filth, she embraced her, exclaiming “What a wonderful girl!”
Aurora gifted her with the name Melusine and requested the girl to be her friend.
At that moment, the “creature” was captivated by the dazzling beauty of the smiling Aurora who was embracing her and, having awakened to the joy of being called a friend, was reborn as a “faerie”.
Afterwards, to be a suitable friend for Aurora, she changed and polished herself and became the Faerie Knight of the present time.
A hundred years passed since.
Even after being appointed as a Faerie Knight, Melusine was still living for the love she felt for Aurora.
 
Even though she knew that inside Aurora was this world’s shallowest and cruelest woman who only loved herself. The adoration felt for the dazzling star witnessed by the creature that had nothing continued to bind Melusine like a curse.

### Appearance

Faerie form:
Her concepts are Faerie Knight, dragon, and faerie of water.
There’s an impression that the dragon’s exoskeleton has become similar to a robot’s armoring.
While the other Faerie Knights are organic, Melusine is inorganic.
Her pupils are also the eyes of a dragon so they possess a depth as if lenses were layered upon each other multiple times.
Even though she is a Lancer, she is fundamentally empty-handed.
She has the image of a warrior who is strong just by being there and finds using weapons inelegant.
When using her Noble Phantasm, the “dragon skin’ and “dragon bones” that make up her outer skin are instantly formed into a blade as she attacks. After it has served its purpose, the blade evaporates in the form of dew.
 
A young woman whose age based on her appearance would be around 16.
She developed herself by copying the physical age of Aurora from when she met her and she can’t grow further than that.
(Meanwhile, Aurora took on the perfected form of a woman in her mid-twenties afterwards)
 
Dragon form:
Since Melusine is only the “left fist” that separated from the ancient dragon Albion and survived, she can not return to Albion’s original gigantic form even when she transforms into a dragon.
A mobile weapon that is 4 meters in length at best. However, just because her frame is small doesn’t mean she is weak; the fact that an ultra-high-performance supersonic bomber is of a small size should be terrifying.
Servants have been compared to fighter jets in the past, but Melusine’s Albion form is “a fighter jet capable of interstellar travel on its own”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Basically, she maintains the same cool and dry demeanor and tone of voice she had back in the Land of the Fae.
However, after being summoned by the Master (her destiny), while she might be “a splendid and perfect knight dressed as a man in public”, she turns into a “super-duper dragon that’s clingy and spoiled while retaining her cool and dry attitude when she is alone with Master”.
But she will snap if you make a fool of Aurora.

### Dialogue Examples

“I have completed the task Her Majesty gave me. The purification of the forest is over. The reason Barghest stopped fighting was because there was no reason to continue. Faerie Knight Gawain was by no means defeated. ────Unlike you, Tristan.” “…Lancelot. In this form, I am Faerie Knight Lancelot. Refer to me by that name or I won’t say anything. …Though I have nothing to say in the first place.”
“…So be it. I’ll lend you a hand, Chaldea (Pan-Human History). For this moment only, I shall release the gift I received from Her Majesty. Listen, this self is not Lancelot! My True Name is Melusine! Melusine of the Murky Marsh! The terminal of Albion who received her name from the most beautiful!”
“Fly towards the distant sky…! Even if you are nothing but broken remains────! …Aah, with this I────”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A faerie of France. Also known as Melisande.
A heroine of stories about “interspecies marriage”, which has served as a theme for folk tales since ancient times.
A half-human, half-monster beauty with the lower body of a snake and the wings of a dragon.
A fae folk born between a human father and a fae mother, she was a beautiful girl who received a curse where her lower body turned into that of a snake on Saturdays for the sin of imprisoning her father in a cave.
It is said that her curse worsened when her lover saw her transformed state and she ended up turning into a repulsive snake.

### Role within the Game

“She is indebted to Morgan so she wants to serve her”
“Once the people of the Pan-Human History known as Chaldea have appeared in the Land of the Fae, she knew cooperating with them would be the best for this planet”
While simultaneously having these two thoughts, her ultimate choice will always betray both.
That is because no matter how inhuman the request may be if Aurora were to ask something of her, she couldn’t refuse.
The reason for Melusine to live. The meaning of her existence. The “love” she swore to devote everything to.
Manipulated by the egotistical self-indulgence of that “love”, the destruction of Britain is made certain.
One of the calamities mentioned in the prophecy that would destroy Britain. The calamity of flames.

### Connections with Characters

#### Morgan

In truth, she knew about Morgan (Tolenico) from before the Queen Calendar started. However, back then she was nothing but a “creature” so they never interfered with each other.
Acknowledging her not as a “Faerie of Paradise”, but as Morgan, “the Queen of the Land of the Fae”, (despite Melusine being listless at heart) she serves her earnestly as a knight.
“I’m surprised she could continue doing something annoying like ruling over the fae folk for two thousand years. Since Her Majesty has such strong perseverance, she would surely cover for me when I cause a problem one day!”
With a carefree and innocent smile on her face, Melusine spills her true feelings to Master alone.

#### Faerie Knight Tristan

She’s incompatible with the free and uncontrolled Tristan who breaks humans by treating them as toys.
In simple terms, “their tastes don’t match”, but since Melusine is bad with words, she told Tristan she had bad taste, and from then on their relationship got worse.
Tristan has been prejudiced against Melusine from the beginning.
“I have more things I like than you. It’s fun how I can get whatever I took a liking to” is what she told her, but in truth, since Tristan didn’t know what true love (devoting yourself, hurting yourself) was yet, she found Melusine’s appearance as she devoted everything to her “love” unpleasant.

#### Faerie Knight Gawain

Gawain might seem bold and arrogant, but in truth, she is faithful to the rule of the wilderness and even ended up falling in love with a human, someone of a different race; Melusine approves of her.
Since Gawain is also top-class among the faeries when it comes to combat power, she took a liking to her as an opponent she could contend with.
However, Gawain reaaaally hates Melusine’s guts so they are destined to never get along.

#### Knight of the Round Table Lancelot

Since Morgan said Lancelot was just right for her when Melusine received his name, she took highly of him while she was in the Land of the Fae.
While she still evaluates his ability and achievements as a knight highly, her evaluation of everything else seems to have changed after coming to Chaldea.
“And here I thought he was a quiet, composed, and unapproachable somber knight who would look good with an anguished look on his face. So this is what “people are not what they seem” means.” thus spoke Melusine while throwing herself on the bed in her third ascension form.
Meanwhile, Master was doing their best to suppress the urge to go “Dragons are not what they seem either”

#### Percival

The only one in the Land of the Fae to reciprocate the “true affection” she shared with them.
Percival and Lancelot.
The future of the Land of the Fae would have surely improved if these two could have lived together as siblings without being separated.
Despite knowing this, the dragon could not betray her yearning for the star and her love plundered even her destiny.

#### Servants with Mechanical Flying Units

Melusine is always boasting about being the greatest flying unit on this planet, but that is because she wants to act as the senior.
Anyway, while she might be eager to assert her dominance in terms of performance, that is not to belittle the opponent. Regardless of the opponent, after their aerial battle, she feels a sense of camaraderie towards them as fellow “conquerors of the skies”. ────The feeling’s very one-sided.

#### Muramasa

He could endure my continuous attack in mid-air for 40 seconds despite being a humanoid type. Unforgivable.

### Scenario Note (Please Read this After Finishing Lostbelt 6)

・Melusine’s reason for serving Morgan.
“Dragonification” can be prevented by being fitted with the mold of a Faerie Knight.
What’s preventing “dragonification” is her love for Aurora, but even that had already reached its limit due to the accumulation of repeated sins.
Accepting the gift Morgan proposed, Melusine could still retain her form as a faerie.
However, with Morgan’s death that support disappears and she starts growing blacker with each passing moment.
Her love for Aurora barely manages to anchor her, but eventually, she breaks even that with her own hands (also because of her love for Aurora) and her ego melts away.
 
・Aurora
A philanthropist with the charisma of the faerie clan aiming for a world where humans and faeries can coexist.
However, that is nothing more than a result stemming from trying to maintain “the surroundings that love her and the world where she can stay number one”.
Everything she does is for the sake of “creating what’s beneficial to her”.
She protects humans because that way the humans will indulge her.
She became a banner for the faeries because that way everyone would respect her.
She acts like an excellent leader so what she does turns into “just sabotaging the other forces and aggravating the situation”.
That allows Aurora’s camp to get out of its predicament, but as a result, Britain’s destruction is fast-forwarded.
 
In the final phase, she deliberately murders the last hope for peace with her selfishness (because she will no longer be the favorite) and, as a result, the Land of the Fae and Aurora’s territory, Salisbury, are engulfed in a great destruction.
While the town is filled with the screams of the populace, Aurora snuggles up to Melusine.
“Hey, let’s escape together, okay?”
“What good will running away do, Aurora? Just where could you go by throwing away this world and the faeries who gathered around you because they trusted you?”
“Right. That is a shame. But they no longer love me, do they? That’s why I no longer need those things. More importantly, why don’t we go to a more fun world? It would be surely better than this boring world.”
Saying so, she takes Melusine’s hand with a pure and innocent smile on her face.
Like when they first met. (Of course, everything is planned out by Aurora. If she asks this way, Melusine won’t be able to refuse.)
 
The reason Melusine killed Aurora was not that “she could no longer go along with her” or that “such evil could not be set free”. She simply knew that even if Aurora were to choose that path, she would no longer shine and would only grow more awful (she would no longer love herself) so, with tears streaming from her eyes, Melusine killed her with her own hands.
“I loved her so I ended her with my own hands.”
“Even though things turned out like this, I still love you.”
Melusine would do whatever it took to keep Aurora alive if it was “for her own sake”. Because Aurora’s existence is the reason why Melusine was here.
But if she chose “for Aurora’s sake,” she would have to kill Aurora no matter how much she loved her. Melusine’s heart was being torn apart by this antinomy. And at the same time, she could no longer maintain her form as a faerie. (Since she lost Aurora (her love))
