### Magic Resistance: B

Regardless of the class, a Faerie Knight possesses a powerful magic resistance.
 
### Territory Creation: B+

Since she inadvertently changes her resting place into “a murky forest lake” regardless of what land or world she’s in, she is treated as someone with a high-rank Territory Creation skill.
 
### Faerie Knight: EX

The divine protection of being chosen as a protector of the fae folk. A geass for a faerie.
It’s a self-strengthening specialized for anti-unit and anti-civilization, but it forbids attacks against other “Faerie Knights” and a Faerie Knight that kills another Faerie Knight will destroy themselves.
