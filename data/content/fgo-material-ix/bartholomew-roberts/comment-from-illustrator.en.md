I did think, “He sure has a lot of character~!” when I received his character profile, but finding out he was 5 times much more intense than my initial impression when he was released was very funny. If I remember correctly, he was supposed to be a closet otaku in his first profile setting (Well, you’re not doing a good job hiding it!) which is why I designed him to have this snobbish feeling over all, then show his unconcealable otaku-ness through his expressions and his gun strap. I guess I could have shown a bit more? Also, his clothes don’t quite fit him because I imagine him to be dressed up in his loots. I want to make him wear a T-shirt like Black Beard. (Mata)
