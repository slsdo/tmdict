### Voyager of the Storm: A+

The talent to helm anything that is recognized as a ship. The ability to lead a group is also necessary, making this a special skill that combines the effects of Tactics and Charisma.

Bartholomew led the world’s largest group of pirates and furthermore imposed an absolute pirate code on them.

### Pirate Gentleman: A

A special skill stemming from the peculiar values of a pirate. This skill is a combination of low-rank Mental Corruption, Valor, and Battle Continuation.

Although he was unpredictably violent with his crew, he also possessed the valor to charge towards a rain of bullets.

He was reluctant to become a pirate at first, hence the low rank.

### Gale Plunder: A

A skill that indicates how much one excels in piracy.

As the captain of the world’s largest group of pirates, Bartholomew was rather adept at plundering.
