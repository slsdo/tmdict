### Presence Concealment (J): B-

She boasts a high degree of covert ability thanks to the active camouflage unit built into the jetpack. Unfortunately, the jets are so noisy when they start up that this Skill receives a minus rating.
Assassination via jets would only work on the most brainless type of character.

### Magic Resistance (J): C

With the help of the magical energy field generated by the M-Drive (a type of Ether reactor), she has realized levels of Magic Resistance unimaginable during her time in the Saber Class.
I mean, isn’t my Magic Resistance too low for a Saber in the first place? I’m from the end of the Edo period, after all.

### Existence Outside the Domain: E

Just because of a mysterious jetpack I’m considered a lifeform from outside the domain!?
