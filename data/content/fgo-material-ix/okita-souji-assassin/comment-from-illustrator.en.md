Designing a swimsuit usually puts big pressure on me, but when I was told Keikenchi-san was implementing a swimsuit Okita it hit me super hard. The pressure was unlike anything before when it came to this design. As such, I was extremely nervous about living up to expectations, but I couldn’t believe me FRICKIN’ mind, and was overjoyed, when I received a compliment from pako-san after the implementation. The first and second ascensions are jets, and the third is a cute swimsuit. That’s how it was laid out, but the design of the third ascension was actually the one I was most worried about. There were some changes made at the very last minute, which caused some trouble for the battle character team… But, thanks to all that, the third ascension turned out really well. The jets and blades were designed by Hirai Yukio-san. I would like to thank them very much for helping out with all our unreasonable requests. (Takeuchi Takashi)
