### Scapegoat: E

A technique that works as an even more narrow version of Human Observation.

It excels in ascertaining whether or not the human that became the target of this Skill will have their talents potentially bloom in the future – no matter what form they would take – and whether or not they will acquire a super-armed might of the type with a single breakthrough point.{{n1}}

### Advice of the Strategist: B++

A Skill given to Strategist Servants. By grasping and analyzing the state of affairs, one can give the correct advice to their allies.

This Skill originally stopped at “Rank B”, but there is now a “+”{{n2}} modifier, derived from the fact that Lü Bu obeyed Chen Gong. In do-or-die situations, it possesses the possibility for Chen Gong to give “advice to his lord” that are better than those given out by Kongming.

### Desire of the Strategist: A

Chen Gong ran through the battlefield together with the Hero of Betrayal/Lü Bu. Although Chen Gong is cold-hearted/cool-headed, he is also endowed with the beliefs and passions of a military man just like that. An oath from his soul to “die for the sake of his lord” and to “die together with his lord.” In other words, that became the long-cherished desire of the strategist.

It is a “Hero Creation” that can be done by Chen Gong, but limited to only Berserker-Class Servants.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} This Skill description is for the Discerning Eye Skill, not the Scapegoat Skill. Considering that this flavour text is different from Waver’s and is meant for Chen Gong, I think Chen Gong should actually have the Discerning Eye Skill, but its description is mistakenly placed under the Scapegoat Skill, and thus the description for the Scapegoat Skill didn’t make it to this material profile.
2. {{note2}} This is supposed to be “++” like in Chen Gong’s game profile text instead of “+”.
