I got to formally go through Chen Gong’s design thoroughly, building upon his drifting design I drew in Lü Bu’s ED (Ending) in Fate/EXTELLA. His face is a rendition of Sugishita [U]kyou’s face from around the time where the detective appeared in the AI[BOU] preseason!!! I decided on making him sexy, given that I was given a specification in designing him as though he was a fiendish strategist with glasses. It’s my own subjective view of the specification given to me. During his FGO debut, finding out that he was really that kind of character was so unthinkable to me, I laughed very, very hard so much. And because of that, I laughed hard just as much again when I actually gave him a try in-game too. (Wadarco)
