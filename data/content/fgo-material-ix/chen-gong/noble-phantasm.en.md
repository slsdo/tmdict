Chen Gong’s wretched Noble Phantasm that uses the surplus parts of the Five Soldiers of the God of War that were made at the time of developing that weapon… as an ultra-small Magic Circuit super accelerator, something that would not be noticed by anyone either… and it temporarily super-strengthens an ally, granting them super attack power as it makes them reach a supercritical state. It is something that gives big damage to his opponents by sacrificing one Servant from his own army. It is like “a Stella done with another person’s life.” It is the worst thing imaginable.

“Striking the strongest from the enemy side with the strongest from our side. What remains afterwards is a small fight between minor troops. Let us rally our troops then, no matter what the means are————”

That is Chen Gong’s stock phrase, the military commander reciting it in a refreshing tone while looking down on the enemy camp that became scattered due to his explosion.

In order to soften that excessively terrible impression, Chen Gong makes use of an illusionary art from a bamboo Magecraft strip originating from the ancient Xia Dynasty, camouflaging the scene so that it is seen like “When Chen Gong terrifically fires an arrow at the enemy camp, that enemy camp explodes for some reason.”
