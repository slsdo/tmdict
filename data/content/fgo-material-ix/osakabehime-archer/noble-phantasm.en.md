Hakuro Jyou・Senshiki Mili-Mili Night Fever.
A battalion of origami (one thousand sheets) that is fully utilized for volley firing, cover bombing, and main battery shooting.
It’s the dazzling climax of the bombing raid. Explode, Explode!
By the way, mili-mili is an abbreviation for “Million Military,”
