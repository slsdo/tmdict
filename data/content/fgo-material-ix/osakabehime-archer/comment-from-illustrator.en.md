Takeuchi san suggested “a stylish dark jacket like in a survival game!” I thought for a moment, “Okki…Stylish!?” I’m really glad I didn’t do the pink naked overalls I had pictured in my mind that I was about to submit when I had the chance. It’s no longer a swimsuit anymore. The gun was very difficult to design, resulting in a rather creative design. I somehow managed to submit it, though then got an additional order for a location…gue! At first the origami soldiers were only just frogs, but they ended up accepting everything including the tigers and chickens that I had scribbled in the corners, I can only offer my gratitude for that….
