### Personality

She has become just a bit more active now that her Saint Graph [霊基, Reiki, NA localized as “Spirit Origin”] has changed from Assassin to Archer. To the extent that she has stopped being a shut-in and has immersed herself in survival games{{n1}}. However, the fundamental nature of wanting to play around hasn’t changed. She is just one of those types of people who don’t want to work.

### Attitude towards Master

Not especially different from when she was an Assassin. The heart of a maiden is complicated and mysterious, searching aimlessly in the dark, and without compassion.

### Dialogue Examples

“We’ve lost communication! Now that it has come to this, all troops charge! Fire, fire, fire! Alright, bombing raid successful! This is the Princess’s Hakuro Castle - Thousand Forms Mili-Mili Night Fever!”

“Alright, time to take the offensive! Osakabehime loves Ma-chan, yup! That comes from the very bottom of my heart! Ah, I’m not the type to endure too much, is that what you call rushing recklessly? Anyway, be prepared! Do you understand me, Ma-chan!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Comparable to Osakabehime (Assassin).

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The first assassin of the 2019 swimsuit event,
“Here We Come! Las Vegas Official Bout ~ Tournament of the Seven Swimsuit Blademasters!”.
The casino has been remodeled into a survival game zone in order to fully enjoy a rare outdoor summer.

One of the swimsuit blademasters who protects the casino under the command of the Ruler, the Lion King.
“It can’t be helped since I was ordered to,” she states making excuses for herself as she enjoys the summer.

Thus naturally, she forgot about the matter of the manuscript.
Is that alright? It’s fine. If I progress at a pace of 20 pages a day, I should be able to make it in time…!
So the person in question said, but she couldn’t make it in time, so Kiyohime forcibly imprisoned her inside the bell so she could work on the manuscript and just barely meet the deadline.

### General Armaments

Auto-pistol (toy) / submachine gun (toy) / automatic sniper rifle (toy) / gatling gun (toy)

### Connections with Characters

#### Kiyohiー

Somehow they managed to chase me with a flashlight strapped to their head while riding to the theme song of Grave Village.
“Ge-n-ko-ma-da-de-su-ka-!”

#### Musashi-chan

Huh? This Musashi-chan, isn’t this by any chance yabai (ヤバい, risky), is something like this really okay? So this is how it turned out.

#### Katsushika Hokusai (Swimsuit)

Stop it! Stop it! You’ll regret it for the rest of your life!
The name for the sword!? Four sword style (alt. school of four swords)!? Such a cool and terrifying thing…!

#### Jack, Nursery, and other child-like Servants

Yes yes, what’s the next request? (while folding origami)

#### Tomoe Gozen (Swimsuit)

Bwoom, bwoom.
