### Personality

An insane girl who overflows with love and kisses with bloodstained lips. A dancing girl clad in thin veils who happened to fascinate even her stepfather, the King. Cruel and brutal, Salome gets excited with the blood of her beloved.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Salome properly understands the relationship between Master and Servant. She really does, and yet, as their bond with each other deepens and she happens to become intimate with them, it seems she will eventually have a desire in wanting to “have” her Master.

She will want… their head.

Salome is actively trying not to behead her Master in that case since she is aware of the matter where if her Master loses their life, then she cannot maintain her materialization as well, but if the ideal opportunity happened to appear to her, then sure enough————

### Dialogue Examples

“Lovely, lovely… Now, please give me your head!”
“The lips of a lovely person is the taste of love. The taste of blood is more enlightening than any high-grade alcohol of the finest quality.”
“Jokanaan, hehe, Jokanaan!”
“Do you like me? Heeey, do you?”
“My King… My King… Don’t you want to see my dance?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

(Writer: Morise Ryou)

Salome is the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, one of the four feudal lords [Tetrarchs] (since Israel at that time was under Roman control, they were more accurately government proxies) who ruled over Galilee and Perea in the same time period as the Messiah’s. She fell in love with John the Immerser, also known as John the Baptist, and she used the fact that her stepfather King Herod was in love with her to obtain John. She seduced King Herod, who is said to have not allowed the Immerser alone to leave prison, and had him decapitate John————She had then attained the head of her beloved one.

Although her name did not appear in the New Testament, it turned out to be “Salome” in “Antiquities of the Jews” that was written by Flavius Josephus, a Hebrew writer from the same time period as Salome’s.

It turned out that the situation of “John the Immerser’s head was placed on a platter, carried in that condition, and handed over to a girl” gave vivid inspiration to artists of posterity, those artists painting religious paintings of it in great numbers from over the Renaissance Period to the Baroque Period. Through these artworks, various speculations were made regarding Salome’s motive.

In the story “Hérodias (the French word form of Herodias)” – which was written by Gustav Flaubert, a novelist of 19th Century France – Salome’s ambitious mother Herodias was afraid of John’s influence, and that was treated as the reason for the incident taking place, Salome herself being depicted in a complicit role all the way to the end of the story. But afterwards, it turned out that Oscar Wilde published the play “Salome” in the year 1893{{n1}}, which resulted in the play being made into an opera by Richard Strauss, and that allowed the deplorable image of Salome – a girl who is deeply in love with Jokanaan (John), resulting in her eventually wanting his head – to take hold.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Although she was a pure girl in her lifetime, it appears that Salome has materialized in a state where her mind was fixed as it was at the moment when she approached her end, yearning for love and perishing in madness.

As a Servant, Salome is overflowing broadly and generously with her love, which should have been devoted only to John the Immerser. That is to say, she will completely fall in love with even those who oppose her. It seems that if she is controlled well, Salome can work as a powerful Berserker, but it appears that each time she kills an opponent who she fell in love with, her mind will creak and break even more.

### Connections with Characters

#### Saint and Prophet Servants

“Oh, yes. That’s right! I feel as if you’re similar to Jokanaan. It’s lovely, isn’t it? It’s very, very, very very very lovely, isn’t that right?————”

#### Sovereign Servants

“……Oh, yes. You’re… a King, right?”

#### Scheherazade

“At first, I thought that she was also someone similar to me, since it’s been said that she’s poor with Kings… I wonder if I can get along with her then.
Yes. I was able to get along with her! I think I have a new friend. Ah, Scheherazade. Pretty Scheherazade. Also, please let me hear one of your tales, ok? The tales she spins… are very, very lovely… Hehe. I… was able to get something to look forward to in Chaldea.”

#### Ibaraki-douji

“I wonder how I can put it… That child… She’s a terrible THING from the Orient, isn’t that right? The child herself often says that… she’s not a human… But even then, I wonder why… do I, somehow, have a feeling of closeness with her? To have a feeling like THAT… I wonder why it’s continuing to surge up from within me…————”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The Salome play’s original publication was in the year 1891 in London. The publication in the year 1893 refers to the one published in Paris, as the one prior to it was not approved for presentation in Britain due to it depicting biblical characters on stage, which was prohibited because of an English rule.
