Salome is famous in theatre, but if I were to draw her in accordance with the rendition formed by the stage play, she would have been nude and covered in copious amounts of blood while holding a freshly severed head, sooo, given that it would have completely become a BRUTAL thing, that depiction would have naturally been rejected. I tried to draw her as a dancer with a moderately erotic impression and one who has an oriental sensation. There is a mature impression about her as a result of her makeup, but she is considerably younger in her setting. The performance of her voice actor regarding that area was splendid I tell you. If one makes a move on this girl, then they will get a CRAZY feeling to an outrageous extent! (Shimokoshi)
