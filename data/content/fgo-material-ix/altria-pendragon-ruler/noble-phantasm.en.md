Bright Ehangwen.
The high mobility great hall Ehangwen that conquers the surface of the waters is temporarily materialized, firing a super-large magical light unto the entirety of the enemy camp, it is the greatest attack of the Swimsuit Lion King, Artoria Ruler.
It is unclear whether the Ehangwen of the past had this sort of navigational or bombardment capabilities, though from her manner of speech “while it has never done it before” “there is nothing it can’t do” or something similar to that regard.
On the other hand, in relation to the bombardment, there are suspicions such as “isn’t it actually the installed Rhongomyniad doing that” and “isn’t it actually the same Noble Phantasm as when you were a Lancer.” Concerning this matter, she remains silent and says nothing at all.
