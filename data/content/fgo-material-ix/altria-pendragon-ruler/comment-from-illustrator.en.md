The first ascension was a bunny, and the second ascension was a swimsuit…it was a natural progression, but I had some trouble deciding on the third ascension, I listed several candidates and waited for Takeuchi san and the management’s direction on the matter. I expected it would be something like an armor dress, but the response that came back was “bunny armor dress with a card funnel” …am I…a genius after all. The lion proposed in the rough idea draft (アイデアラフ, aidea rafu) was also accepted as a method of attack, and the ship design for instance as well was something I had never experienced before, but it was enjoyable being able to illustrate it.
