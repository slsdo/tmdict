### Swan Lake: A

By suppressing her “Sadistic Constitution” skill, “Crime Ballet” has transformed into this. In exchange for diluting its offensive and evasive aspects, she has become a dancer who can mesmerize the audience for even longer and in a more beautiful manner.
Her Arts performance is raised for 5 turns.
At max rank, the cooldown is reduced to 4 turns, and by stacking it, the chance for “the greatest triple axel” will arrive as well.

### Perfect Fluid: B

The authority of Leviathan. She fills the world with seawater by turning herself into a fluid state.
Invincibility + buff removal resistance + the field is changed to “waterside” for 3 turns. The only way to defeat a Melt who has used this skill would be with invincibility pierce.

### Melt Envy: EX

Tainted by one of the Seven Deadly Sins, Envy.
Due to the influence of Leviathan, the Melt Virus has transformed.
She steals 20~30% of the NP gauges of the party’s Servants, concentrates the critical stars on herself, and raises the might of her Noble Phantasm.
It charges her gauge by 60% at maximum. It might appear to be powerful at first glance, but it is a devilish skill that can throw the party off-kilter in a critical moment.
