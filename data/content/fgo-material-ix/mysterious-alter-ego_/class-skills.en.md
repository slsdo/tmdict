### High Servant: A

A man-made Servant created through combining several mythology essences.
She possesses the components of Artemis, Leviathan and Saraswati.

### Riding: C

A talent/ability for riding. Having become a Lancer, the rank dropped.

### Divine Core of the Goddess: C

A skill symbolizing that one has been a perfect goddess since their birth.
Its rank has dropped after Lambda switched her main essence from Saraswati to Leviathan.

### Magic Resistance: B

Invalidates magic invoked through arias with less than three verses.
Even High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals will have a hard time wounding Lambda.

### Independent Action: EX

The ability to be self-reliant for a while even if the magic supply from her Master is cut.
As an Alter Ego that is “a different aspect of a certain being”, she is capable of acting independently even without a Master.
Having awakened to not only ballet but also figure skating, her “Star Upon a Stage” has been further refined.
Before her charisma, the contractor would surely rather be the Servant who supports her. Perhaps.
