She was assigned the image of a figure skater. She is a fairy of the waters in her third ascension, she wears a school swimsuit in the style of a high-leg leotard in her second ascension, and finally, she is a penguin in her first ascension!!! Yay~!!! I could come up with her design and draw her in a standing pose without being unsure about pretty much any parts, and I could pull off the colouring just as I pictured it in my head for her final ascension so she is a rare character of mine I have almost no regrets about as a whole. I like everything about her. She makes me go “Nice” no matter how many times I look at her…!!! I’m so happy!!! Please, let all my characters turn out like this every time!!!! (Wada Arco)
