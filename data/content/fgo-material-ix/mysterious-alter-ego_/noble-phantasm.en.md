### That Summer Dew Is Akin To Glass

Blue Summer Palladion.
According to Lambda: “Summer Dew” is read as “natsu” while “Glass” is read as “hoshi”.{{n1}}
The targets are enclosed in a sphere of water and restrained. Lambda herself dives into the giant tidal wave she summoned and starts to swim through the water at high speeds along with the leviathans who serve as her followers. With the acceleration she gained, she launches herself like a missile and pierces through her targets along with the water sphere.
They say Lambda’s appearance as she flies out of the water is like that of a graceful flying fish or that of a mythological spear that could level cities.
If the field is in a “waterside” state, the sphere of water will have an evasion removing effect while her spear attack will ignore defense.

Leviathan Melt Purge.
According to Lambda: The “Elegy of the Seven Sins” part is read as “natsumi hika”.{{n2}} Could she be trying to make a wordplay with “the sin of Summer”…?
The sea fills the heavens and the earth, and a massive tidal wave​ is brought forth.
Those swallowed by the tidal wave are gathered in one place by the vortex and, after being locked up in a ball of water (prison), they are sent into a watery grave by the fangs of Meltryllis imitating a dragon in her perfect fluid state. The sea surrounding Las Vegas was the continuous deployment of this Noble Phantasm.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} “Natsu” means “Summer” while “hoshi” can mean “star” or “planet”.
2. {{note2}} Like the sentence right after this says, Lambda is making a wordplay with “Summer” (natsu) and “sin” (tsumi).
