### Personality

He was summoned as a boy, not an adult.
He retains his indecisive personality and sorta lets others do the thinking for him.
This pretty boy can’t hide the fact he’s something of a loser, but some women take the fact he’s a loser as all the more reason to love him.

He’s a hard worker, but he tends to jump to wildly wrong conclusions, and often makes fatal mistakes due to being instigated by the gods or whatever is happening.

### Attitude towards Master

He’s generally trying to behave like a model Servant.
But his airheadedness doesn’t let him.
He’s innocently stupid, and stupidly pure.

### Dialogue Examples

“Hello! I’m Paris! Is my brother Hektor present? He is. Yay!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Paris was almost killed by the words of an oracle on the night he was born. The tale of his birth was a case of misfortune often seen in Greek mythology.

Luck allowed him to survive this purge, but he was abandoned in the mountains, having to suck milk from a bear to survive. And then Paris started living as a shepherd.

His fate took a sudden turn when Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite were fighting over the Golden Apple. That is, during the Judgement of Paris.

Although he already had a wife, he responded to Aphrodite’s tempting offer of marrying him to the most beautiful woman in the world (one as beautiful as herself) and chose her as the most beautiful goddess.

The woman Aphrodite considered the most beautiful in the world was Helen, wife of King Menelaus.
Paris was still young, pure, and filled with hopes and dreams, so he and Helen fell in love on their first encounter… and that’s the start of the Trojan War.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Purity, innocence, and bravery are all aspects of humanity seen as positive, but some critics would say that only makes them worse as flaws.
He’s straightforward, for better or for worse. The moment he learned about Helen’s unfortunate wedded life, he took her away.
He was being instigated by the gods, yes, but that was still an act of justice on his part.

Hektor knew his little brother’s actions would lead to big problems, but did nothing to stop him.
Since the gods intervened, a war would inevitably happen at some point, regardless of reason, and he knew both sides were putting their pride on the line, with no room for compromises.

Paris met a regretful and heartbreaking end in the Trojan War.
But upon being summoned, he fights with simple honesty, without ever sulking. Consider him earnest, in a sense.

However, beware of Apollo, the one who comes bundled with Paris.
He considers preserving Paris his first priority and has little to no concern for anything else, not even his Master.

Apollo is safe while he thinks people are amusing, which turning the words around means that you must be wary of what that Apollo behind Paris will do if he judges you as boring.

### In Atlantis

He fulfilled a containment role, continuously firing arrows from Achilles’s chariot.
Although he survived the naval battle, he ultimately chose to be converted into an arrow to activate Orion’s Noble Phantasm.

A pure golden arrow, tossing his fears and regrets away to concern himself only with flying forward.
This arrow most certainly carried Orion’s heart to pierce Artemis’s core.

### General Armaments

### Apollo’s Bow

Always hits, never misses.

### Apollo (Avatar)

That pile of sheep is actually another weapon.
Apollo kinda likes the rough treatment.

### Connections with Characters

#### Hektor

His glorious brother.
Paris wants to surpass him but believes he never will.
Hektor personally thinks his little brother proved himself at the very end of Atlantis, with a crazy decision Hektor himself would never even consider.
