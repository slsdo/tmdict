### Magic Resistance: B

Negates magecraft with three or fewer verses on their activation. It’s difficult to harm him even with Greater Magecraft or Ritual Curses.

### Independent Action: EX

Paris himself doesn’t have the Independent Action Skill, but Apollo, who is something like a guardian angel to him, will do his thing without answering to anyone.
