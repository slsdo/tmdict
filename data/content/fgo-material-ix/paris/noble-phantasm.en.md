An arrow shot with his utmost efforts, borrowing power for the sun god Apollo.
It overcomes any and all obstacles to land a guaranteed hit on the enemy’s weak spot.
However, a prerequisite to doing so is knowing the enemy’s weak spot.
A killer move against heroes with famous weak spots.
This doesn’t apply only to Achilles. If his weakness is revealed, Paris could even defeat Siegfried, whose body was hardened by dragon blood… maybe.

The apple of misfortune.
An apple with the gods’ power to bring discord.
This apple was supposed to be only a present to the most beautiful goddess, and yet it caused the Trojan War.
The apple itself has no destructive power, but it ultimately causes great destruction. And this destruction doesn’t tell friend and foe apart.
