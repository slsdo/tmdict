He may look like a blond girl at first glance, but that’s the legendarily pretty boy Paris. This has been Kususaga Rin, delivering the boys with 300% more shota-ness. Good day. The concept for him was… a boy who looks like a girl but is most definitively a boy! I aimed to give him strikingly different outfits between Ascensions to portray three completely different species of cuteness, but all I did was work myself to death three times… But a shepherd boy ascending into a sheep (costume) is good civilization. I tried to make the Apollo with him into a Unquestionably Cute Mascot(tm), but later I played the game and found out he’s a shitbag without a single good bone in his body. Wonderful. That threw his cuteness out of the window… It’s amazing how you can feel the evil in his eyes… Also, after drawing Paris, I gained a reputation as the gender-unidentifiable character illustrator. It’s a huge honor! I’ll devote myself to drawing more than just piss{{n1}}! (Go to hell) (Kususaga Rin)

1. {{note1}} At the end of 2017, Kususaga Rin published a Rama/Sita doujin that attracted a small bit of discourse in the Japanese fandom over its kinky portrayal of Sita peeing on Rama.
