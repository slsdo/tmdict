I love all three ascensions equally, because all of them were made under my esteemed Takeuchi-sensei and Keiichi-sensei’s supervision. The mad warrior feeling of the first and third one is pretty good, isn’t it? I liked the ideas so much, that just thinking about them again with this memo makes my heart burst. Battle-types are always the best, and as a fan, I couldn't be more grateful. Thank you so much! (Dd)
