### Blood-Soaked Brute: A

A skill that stems from the bloody anecdotes of Mori’s hakamas being dyed bright red from his victims’ blood. The more he attacks, the stronger he gets. Though, his durability is reduced in exchange.

### Mental Corruption (Wicked): B

An abnormal mentality displayed onto the battlefield. Common mutual understanding with all manner of targets, even with his own Master, becomes unlikely through this rampage. As his frenzy intensifies, he will keep charging head on, willing to give his own life to kill the enemy.

### Oni Musashi’s Will and Testament: C

The last will and testament left behind by Nagayoshi; two different effects are activated, based on whether the skill is deployed in the middle of battle or when he becomes incapacitated respectively. It is the crystallisation of the dubious anecdote in which his death was gloated by both friends and foe.
