### Can’t Be Helped: A-

A double-edged sword that will proceed to burn Nobunaga in exchange for letting her release powerful magical energy. Is this the verdict passed down on her body that disappeared among the flames, or mayhaps…

### Like a Fleeting Dream: B

Due to being under a constant assault from the World’s correction force because of her great might and the unusual nature of her being, Demon King Nobunaga’s existence is hollow and even her Saint Graph itself is in a hazy state.

### The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven: EX

A monster whose past state was twisted later on by her image during her lifetime. The abilities and appearance of the skill’s possessor transform. A skill that is a counterfeit of “Innocent Monster”.
A skill demonstrating her way of being as the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven・Oda Nobunaga who’s already been established as a different existence from the so-called Demon King of the Sixth Heaven appearing in Buddhist teachings.
