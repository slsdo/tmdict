Hajun Henjou · Sanzen Daisen Ten Maou.
A grotesque form that surpasses even the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven that houses within its body the fear and awe of all living things that the past, present and future Nobunagas have been infused with. It metamorphoses into the True Demon King, the “Demon King of the Three Thousand Great Thousand Heavens” that will destroy every god and the Buddha. The end goal of Oda Nobunaga, the crimson anti-hero who reduces mystery to ashes.

Since this form does not exist in history, its existence itself is unstable and can only remain manifested for a limited time.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Hajun is the Japanese name for Papiyas/Mara, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven who tried to tempt Buddha and stop him from reaching enlightenment. Three Thousand Great Thousand Heavens (三千大千天) is probably a reference to Buddhist cosmology where the universe is made up of Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds (三千大千世界). Basically, Nobu is calling herself the Demon King of the Heavenly Universe or something.
