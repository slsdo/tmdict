Designing for FGO is always laborious, and even more-so this time. I felt like I got side-tracked with the android dogâ€™s mecha-designs in particular; I had the image of a Sci-Fi suit for a Phantom Thief, but the mecha aspects couldn't distract from her. Having her bare skin all the more apparent worked out well though, I feel. Overall, I think I really captured an elegant feel for Carmilla with her swimsuits. (okojo)
