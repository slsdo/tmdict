### Independent Action: A

A skill that greatly extends time to stay manifested even without a Master, mana supply, or likewise.

A necessity for a bona-fide celebrity, and a Phantom Thief, to deal with crowds.

### Presence Concealment: B

Suppresses signs of being a Servant, allowing for covert movements.

As a Rider, the skill has ranked up compared to her Assassin container. Perhaps this is because it is “Only fitting for a Phantom Thief to have”.
