### Personality

With an ever present grave demeanor, she instills the attitude of a composed celebrity. As her swimsuit gives off the aura of a composed adult, she maintains a tight grip on her manners.
Especially when she has to flirt to get close to men.
Even though she silently looks down on regular people, she’s a celebrity through and through, waving about an air of noble comfort around her. However, this is largely done to scatter bait and “Ensure tonight’s job will be a success”.
At a glance, one can’t feel the dangerous elements that the true “Blood Countess” possesses, so the thought gradually dissipates. However, this persona only works on a surface level. If you were to probe at her further, it would be relatively easy to reveal her true colors. Without that thin layer protecting her, her small oddities suddenly become red flags.

The Phantom Thief Mistress C strikingly sends her “Mistress Cards” to the owners of the treasures she sets her eyes on. It doesn’t really mean much, but she’s convinced that, “Isn’t this what a celebrity Phantom Thief would do?”.
(While strategizing in your hotel room…)
“So, what’s the next plan…hm? Where’re you going?”
Standing tall at once, Carmilla flashes a sweet smile. She throws a card that turns and stabs into the wall.
Written on it, is…
“I just wanted a drink”.
You could’ve just said that!

(In the dark of night, a card whirls through the window, stabbing itself into the wall!)
Written on it, is…
“Let’s talk. Is now good?”
As you read that, Carmilla suddenly enters through the same window.
Was this just a theatrical way to just say you’re coming in!?

And so, you’re always inferring that “She loves being celebrity Phantom Thief-esque and attractively throwing calling cards in the moment”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She is obstinate on using the Holy Grail to answer her wish and create the True Csjete Castel for herself.

Master is an accomplice, standing by on support. As such, she believes it’s alright to let their occasionally unreasonable demands slide. The backbone of mana they supply to carry out her duties as a Phantom Thief are a necessary support for her.

### Dialogue Examples

“This won’t do, boys. Care for a ride?”

“O-hohoho! I am the Mystery Phantom Thief: Mistress C! This ruby, more red than a maiden’s blood, is all mine!”

“What a wonderful night. I can think of only two things more beautiful than the stars in the sky at present. Could you guess what? The treasure now in my possession…and you beside me, more valuable than any gemstone.”

“…Cutting through the dark, red silhouette…

…unwavering, dangerous speed…”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

If we’re being completely honest, she has long watched her other self with abject jealousy. Halloween? Brave? Mecha? And even a Japanese gothic form!? Why does SHE get so many different versions!?

Taking a good hard look at her actual self and her, she saw there was no discussing it. One was clearly “A bloody countess”, and the other, “A past self, transformed by the moon or something weird”.

Maybe it was from watching her appear time and time ago, leaving herself to say “You, again”, but she refused to give up.

Summer was her chance. She still hadn’t touched the Swimsuit Domain. She still had a chance to show up there!

“I will NOT let her be the one to keep standing out!” And when her frustrations finally exploded, her Spirit Origin changed into a long-anticipated swimsuit Servant.

Now that she finally feels at ease now that she has gained a swimsuit form, and she is able to behave more like a mature and sophisticated woman…in other words, she now has a sense of celebrity.

With her newly enhanced ego, she thought up a grandiose plan to further solidify her status as the great countess: remodeling Castle Csejte.

Turning the castle into a giant music amplifier like that brat did is out of the question: Confinement Castle Cjete was half-assed and wrong. The castle needs to be more glorious, more suitable for torture…meaning she needs to build a Torture Castle Csejte! Such a project will surely set her apart from that brat, and show the world which of them is better once and for all!

But the problem is cost.The celebrity, overflowing with the allure of fame and beauty, needed to plan how to collect funds. Working hard or negotiating like some commoner simply will not do for such a sophisticated woman. No, that is beneath a celebrity of her caliber.

But raising funds by gathering jewelry, famous paintings, necklaces, and other such valuable treasures…? Yes, that sounds just perfect. And that would mean…

You can see where this is going, right?

That’s right: Becoming a Phantom Thief.

A high-society swimsuit celebrity that would now ride in her Noble Phantasm/Iron Maiden turned supercar, she’d get robot-dogs, and she’d start using the moniker of Phantom Thief: Mistress C. Her goal would be loads of treasures of course, as well as being filthy rich and perfect for Las Vegas!

### Connections with Characters

#### Elizabeth

Would love to gleefully run her down once the chance presents itself.

#### Vlad III (Berserker)

Joked about Carmilla’s appearance once her first saw her saying, “You are a lord, yet look to have lost the pride of one” with a pained expression. After noticing that her goal was reclaiming her one true castle for herself, he said, “Phantom Thief? Foolish, but, do as you’d want.”, and took the stance of a spectator.

#### Moriarty

Since they’d make good partners, there’s a chance they could join forces.

However, since the professor has a primary interest in being “excessive” in his would-be actions as a phantom thief, he’d probably lose interest if the treasure wasn’t already protected under extreme measures.

#### Hijikata Toshizo

“Toshizo, darling, you look deplorable as usual. Come here, let’s get you dressed in a high class suit.”

#### Celebrity Servants

“May I host a ball for us?

I’d like to make some friends to call upon, lest I be lonely once I construct my castle. There’s all manners of things I’d like to chat about. For example…what kind of treasures they keep in their castle vaults, and so on.”

#### Pirate Servants

“You aren’t celebrities. Why would I spend time with you?”

#### Swimsuit Musashi / Hokusai / Okita

“You aren’t celebrities. You don’t even have any money.”

#### Mysterious Alter Ego Lambda

“Now there’s someone worth talking to. She’d make a lovely Cinderella-themed phantom thief. She seems to like teasing others as well. I’ll store these feelings on the backburner for now. I wonder if I could recruit her someday…”

#### Swimsuit Osakabehime

“A princess, rather than a celebrity. Will she ever calm herself down more? Yet I do wonder, what sort of fantastical treasures are in the keep of Himeji Castle…?”

#### Swimsuit Artoria (Ruler)

“An unmistakable celebrity. What amazing items would the ruler of Las Vegas have tucked away?”
