### Femme Fatalle (False): A

A skill that enables her to naturally slip right next to her target. This indicates her proficiency in the preliminary investigation needed for a phantom thief, and it’s a compound skill that includes analysis, intelligence, the use of pheromones, disguise, covert action, and more.

Her demonic nature makes anyone, male or female, naturally fall in love with her as she gets close to them when she goes in for a steal. But the feeling is but an illusion that persists only until her thieving is done. No matter how precious, compatible, and comfortable that love may seem, it will never truly go anywhere.
No matter how much the other person may wish it.
Even…if she herself wishes it.

“What th-? Where’s the gem for today’s wedding!? Didn’t we put it in the safe!?”
“Heavens! But let’s not this bad news affect the bride to be. She’s still in the bathroom, for now…”
“Inspector! We found a wig in the bathroom!”
“Also, an unknown woman was seen speeding off in a red sportscar!”
“You dunderheads, that was Mistress C!”

### Thief’s Calling Card: A

A most bold card left by the mysterious female thief “Mistress C” before she carries out her crime. It bears an image of some sort of canine symbol, as well as messages like, “On this day at this time, I will come take ◯◯.” The described act is always carried out flawlessly.

The act of sending a calling card creates a unique feeling of ecstasy…or rather a form of catharsis. But be warned: once she gets hooked on doing this, she’ll keep on throwing cards at you during ordinary conversations.

### Mistess C: EX

A skill that changes Swimsuit Celebrity Madam Carmilla into a mysterious a mysterious thief called Mistress C. Generally nobody knows her true identity.

”Her appearance is simply graceful…so elegant…And just so sexy… (sigh)”

Mistress C is a terrifying sexy lady with vast knowledge of myriad advanced gadgets, a body to die for, skills at the wheel of her bright red car that would make racers green with envy, and has A LITTLE bit of skill in torture.
Locked door? She’ll enter through the vents.
So easy, it’s torture.
The owner’s holed themselves up? She’ll drug the guards to sleep.
So easy, it’s torture.
The police established countermeasures? She’ll befriend the guard dogs.
So EASY, it’s torture!
She prefers not to kill on her heists, not because she has any interest in justice or the like, but because she thinks that if she hears the screams of her victims, she might get a bit…distracted.
