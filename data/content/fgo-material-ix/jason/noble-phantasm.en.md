A rescue and support attack from the Argo.
The heroes who once boarded (Note: due to the limits of Jason’s ability, he can only manifest up to half of them) his ship coordinate a simultaneous attack.
In a sense, it’s an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm comparable to the great Conqueror King’s own.
The more righteous Jason’s position in battle is, the more he gets his crewmates’ approval, increasing the number of attacks.

Conversely, if his position is clearly villainous, a surprising amount of people will be absent from the ship (skipping the job), considerably decreasing its power.
This was sealed and rendered unusable in Okeanos.
