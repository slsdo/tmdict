### Riding: B

Talent for riding. Can ride most mounts better than most people but can’t mount beasts on the ranks of demonic beasts or holy beasts.

### Magic Resistance: B

Negates magecraft with three or fewer verses on their activation. It’s difficult to harm him even with Greater Magecraft or Ritual Curses.
