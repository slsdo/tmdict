For the first version of his NPC design, I did a mean-faced loser, but I got told to make him hot, so I updated the design into something more good looking. To my complete surprise, he was later chosen to become a Servant, so I gave him a design themed after many different 80's rockstars. I love myself hilariously uncool guys. Also, he has a lot facial expression, just like Gof. (BLACK)
