### The Desired Golden Fleece: Unranked

A fleece made of golden wool that he obtained at the end of his adventure. Relatively comforting and pleasant.

### Inspiration at Death’s Door: A

When he gets into a scrape, he can escape with seemingly self-sacrificing moves.
He’s unsurpassable went it comes to getting epiphanies at the jaws of death.
However, Jason strongly hates this ability.
After all, he has to go through a life-threatening situation every time he needs a flash of inspiration.

### Conquering the Long Voyage with Friends: B++

He pumps those who once boarded the Argo full of courage.
Those who never did vaguely feel somewhat encouraged.
Consider it a super-limited variant of Charisma’s abilities.
