### Golden Rule (Body): EX

Due to being downsized, the range of her universal capabilities narrowed, but in exchange for that, her Golden Rule was elevated.
Originally, inquiring about Da Vinci’s gender was a fruitless endeavor, but perhaps due to becoming a little girl model, she got closer to being an “angel” in the spiritual sense.

### Accel Turn: B

A skill inspired by the goddess of Summer, Ishtar.
As an excellent driver, it is possible to make emergency evasive measures when she feels like “Now’s the time!”

### A Dream For The Planet: D

The conclusion of a hope harbored by all that was created with a fleeting lifespan.
The “Pioneer of The Star” skill is missing from this Leonardo da Vinci.
However, the reason that an intellectual form was born in that soul and the truth that such short-lived beings should aim for, dwell in “the arts”.
She, who was made by “Humanity’s Greatest Intellect”, Leonardo da Vinci and having inherited that intelligence, has arrived at the truth of the “farsightedness and objectivity that stems from a short-lived existence (life) that was manufactured” that both Mashu and the homunculi possess.

Please tell me, o ephemeral yet shining infant.
I who have lived through hundreds upon millions of years will eventually be on my deathbed.
O children, who were given merely a few millennia for evolution.
Do grant unto this dying planet a final dream.
At the end of that trifling yet ever-brilliant conclusion of childhood.
