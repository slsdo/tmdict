### Riding: B

The talent for riding. She can ride ordinary vehicles and mounts better than your average person, but she can not mount demonic or sacred beasts.

### Territory Creation: C

The ability to create a magic workshop.
Perhaps due to having no past records of doing so, the rank of the skill decreases compared to the Original Da Vinci’s.

### Overhaul: E

The ability to create tools filled with mana.
Even though she’s a part of the facility known as Shadow Border or Storm Border, Da Vinci produces all kinds of tools to assist in achieving Grand Order.
