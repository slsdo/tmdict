I wanted to make her feel like she had adolescence on full display, unable to be controlled, all messy and stuff, basically just excessively colorful… So I thought of taking the feather garment of the Xians she admires so much and just turn it super flamboyant. After I assembled everything accordingly, this is how she turned out. It’d be a bit bad if she turned out too gaudy so I put in a lot of cute stuff in the patterning. In addition, I wanted to get some of that chuunibyou feeling out and so I mixed in a western sword among the 4 on her hips. She was really difficult to draw. (Kuroboshi Kouhaku)
