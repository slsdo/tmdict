### Divine Power (Ink): C

Making a decoction of Fuling and drinking it, getting hooked on physiognomy, all under the pretence of it being training towards becoming a Xian. We’ve all had such a time in our youth—a period in which you get fanatically obsessed with something.

### Father-Daughter Bond: B

A father watching over his daughter. And the disjointed feelings of a daughter who wishes to surpass her father and be acknowledged by him!

### Pseudonym - [“Dragon-Crested Octopus”]{Ryuumondako}: B

The abyssal madness of the Old One that encroaches upon his daughter’s Saint Graph and transforms it into his own tentacles. Will perhaps take it to another Class once their enthusiasm for moving around and travelling gets bad enough.
