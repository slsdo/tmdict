### Battle Continuation: C

Gareth possesses the Battle Continuation skill on account of her legend in which she fought a duel spanning two hours.

### Gareth of the Beautiful Hands: B

While working in the castle disguised as a kitchen boy, Sir Kay nicknamed her “Beaumains (Beautiful Hands)” for her fair and beautiful appearance. At the time, Kay did not realize that it was Gareth in disguise.

In other words, Gareth had fair and lustrous skin, and her hands were especially beautiful.

### Ring of Transformation: B

Gareth owns a ring infused with magecraft for disguises.
Originally this should be classified as a Noble Phantasm effect, but in the game this effect manifests as a skill.
