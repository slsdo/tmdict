The instruction I received was to draw an “untrained squire”. She’s a hard worker who earnestly polishes cheap steel, turning it into shining armor. Her first and third ascensions have the themes kitchen/errand boy and Knight of the Round Table, respectively. The cartridges attached to her waist holder are based on grenades. I drew her final ascension with hopes that she, as a Heroic Spirit, could become [the player’s] partner in the story. (Nekotawawa)
