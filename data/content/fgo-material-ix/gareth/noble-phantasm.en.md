Ira Lupus: The sublimation of her skillful jousting techniques as a Noble Phantasm. After dealing a series of raging blows, she pierces her enemy with a lethal hit.

When she fought to protect her best friend Lady Lioness (Dame Lyonesse) in the past, she defeated a great many famed knights with a single lance, such as Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Galihodin, Sir Galihud (not to be confused with Galahad), Sir Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, King Agwisance of Ireland, King Carados of Scotland, King Uriens of the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus.

On another occasion, she challenged King Arthur to a joust, and was praised and given the epithet “Raging Wolf” for her fighting prowess.
