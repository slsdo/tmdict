Her sharp skill to slash down all that’s mystic has dropped in rank now that she became a Berserker.

### Mad Enhancement: EX

She got real weird for “reasons”. (Got turned into a Celestial Demon in the Grail Rice Incident).

### Riding: D

Gets to Ganryuujima by jet ski. Musashi thought that was a valid way to be Musashi.

### Divinity: D

“Musashi, are you eating Buddha’s rice?”
“Ehehehe” (Nervous laughter exposing 100% of her stupidity)
