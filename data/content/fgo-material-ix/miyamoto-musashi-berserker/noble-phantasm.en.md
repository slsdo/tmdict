A fantastic sword move said to be used only once during Musashi’s long life as a swordsman.
Since no one who has ever seen it survived, only Musashi knows what the technique is like.
A special Saint Graph that mercilessly insults, disparages and crushes swordsmen who degrade themselves to sorcery, dark arts, or heresy.

Its other name is Anti-Swordsman/Anti-Swordsmaster Greater Bounded Field: Ganryuujima.
Since she became a Berserker, this is no longer her intelligent but dishonorable killing method where she remodeled one island into an Anti-Swordsman Fortress, lured the opponent to the center of it, activated its traps, and ultimately crushed the entire island to crush her opponent in it.
It’s now a Celestial Phenomenon where she uses her five magnificent swordsmanship forms (Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, and Void) to launch a large amount of seawater upward, forming cascades surrounding the enemies, and bisects the enemies along with the cascades.
“Here I go! Anti-Swordsman, Anti-Swordsmaster Greater Bounded Field! This is my! GANRYUUJIMA!”
