### Accel Turn: B

She watched Summer Ishtar’s Skill once and copied it.
Our plagiarism victim Ishtar only made one short, loathing comment. “That damned genius…!”

### Fifth Sakari: B

A skill like Fifth Seihou but different. Upon close observation, you can notice the word Sei (force) was replaced by the word Sakari (height of summer heat).
Her pair of shapeshifting swords can change into a single blade. The hit count doesn’t change, but it gains Sure Hit, and better NP generation and star drop.

### Celestial Demon’s Glare: EX

The Heavenly Eyes gone haywire.
She lets her own Saint Graph rampage until the verge of collapse, gaining an explosion in attack power. When she does, her Heavenly Eyes sharpened to extreme levels see through all of the enemies’ defensive actions and demolishes them.
Since she detects all defensive actions in her line of sight, this affects the entire enemy line-up, not just an individual.
