The first two Ascensions were easy choices. The competitive swimming swimsuit was just out of personal preference, and the chambara swords just came along with its sporty imagery; and the America bikini with a pair of Gunblades was because the summer event was set in Las Vegas. The Third Ascension was difficult to deliver, but I could get something done with the keywords “Japanese-style” and “Celestial Demon”. It might be difficult to see with how fast the animation is, but she can switch the sides of the greatsword’s blade and attack with the bigger part. I changed her hairstyle to make it easier to distinguish her from Saber Musashi and changed the color in every Ascension in an attempt to make it easier to visualize in the icon. (Koyama Hirokazu)
