If I remember correctly, ‘a normal and cute girl’ was the kind of instruction I received. I tried bringing out a kind of cliched cuteness that I’d always wanted to draw at some point. What do you think? A bit too much of a normal girl? Is that fine? I worried about that a lot. Personally, I like all of her ascensions. (Aotsuki Takao)
