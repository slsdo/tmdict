### Fate is in Heaven: A

Kenshin, who has faith in Bishamonten’s divine protection, can receive an advantageous check for every action she performs on the battlefield.
“In any case, my luck in battle is awesome. As one would expect, I’m the Avatar of Bishamonten, don’t you think?”

### Armour is on the Chest: A

A Defense Skill against projectiles. It is said that while she was alive, Kenshin even leisurely slurped on sake before the enemies’ eyes as bullets flew about, all the bullets going past and avoiding her, and that anecdote became this Skill. Her self-confidence developed into a phenomenon similar to event manipulation, resulting in even the bullets’ trajectory to curve around her, and if said person does not believe she will be hit, then the bullets will never, ever hit her. But if the shooting is loaded with such vigour to the degree that said person will believe she will be hit, then it is possible to break through this divine protection.
“Though I’m uncertain whether or not there is such a fellow.”

### Accomplishment is in the Feet: A

A faculty that shows the tactical intuition of Kagetora, who was extolled to be Japan’s peerless in war. Kagetora experienced more than 70 engagements in her lifetime and triumphed in just about most of them, but she is somewhat poor at castle sieges.

“Aah, dammit! Come out and fight!”
