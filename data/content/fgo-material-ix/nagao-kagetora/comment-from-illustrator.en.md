After Okita and Ms. Majin, it has been decided that we will make a new character for the GUDAGUDA Group, and Kagetora is a character who was finally finished after we quibbled over everything, saying “It should be like that; It should be this way.” We proceeded by collecting concepts and designs of a ‘Japanese-style God of War’, and for Kagetora, I believe her design was completed so well to the extent that it even competes for first place among my character lineup. In order to show the character’s individuality, I decided on a plan of making all her facial expressions to be smiling faces, but that might have been a bit overkill. Shimaudon-kun was responsible for her weapons’ designs, while Shimokoshi-kun was responsible for her horse’s design. She became a very magnificent character who has depth. (Takeuchi Takashi)
