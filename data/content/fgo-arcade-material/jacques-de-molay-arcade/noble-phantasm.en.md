Pèlerinage du Temple

History of the glory and decline of the Knights Templar.

An assault of sword and horse wearing a brilliant illusion.

It boasts a life of 200 years from the origin of the Order at the site of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem to the fire prison on the island of Cite on the Seine in Paris.

The gallant figure of the last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, who wields his sword while being wrapped in the fire of self-immolation, glows bright like he were an extinguished light.
