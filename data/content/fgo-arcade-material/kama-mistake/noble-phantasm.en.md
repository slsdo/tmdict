Kama Sammohana

The primary Noble Phantasm of Kama god of love. The spelling is different but the reading is the same. Kama possesses a flower arrow called Sammohana which has the effect of arousing feelings of love in the object it pierces.

Normally due to her trauma she doesn’t want to use this Noble Phantasm for the sake of others…. she still feels the same way but this time there are situations in which she is forced to use it since she is pretending to be Cupid.

However due to her twisted personality and difficult circumstances instead of manifesting as the “fulfillment of pure love” it is often used as “depravity as a result of fulfilled desire”. She unapologetically admits “This too is a form of love” and secretly gloats.
