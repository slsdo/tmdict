### Magic Resistance. A

Cancel spells of A-Rank or below. Modern mages are unable to harm her with their magecraft.

### Independent Manifestation: C

A special Skill. The ultra-superior version of Independent Action. The corruption of love can appear anywhere. As a Servant, Kama has basically zero motivation so this skill is in a state of being sealed at her depths, but the effects of “instant death and mental debuff resistance” are still in effect. This may or may not be part of the reason why she was summoned to the Arcade World.

### Divine Core of the Love God: B

A skill that representing her being a perfected god of love from birth. The god of love version of the Divine Core of the Goddess Skill.
It has the effect of maintaining the absoluteness of the mind and the body. It mitigates almost all mental interference, prevents the body from growth, and it prevents the figure from changing no matter how many calories are absorbed….
On the other hand, as a god of love, it is also endowed with the special characteristic of “being able to change into the form necessary for the act of loving”; at the end of the day, “transforming as one pleases” is also something that symbolizes a great degree of freedom when it comes to one’s flesh and outward appearance. A skill that every woman would covet. However, under the present circumstances, it is not possible to change the figure to an extent that would leap past the vessel’s framework.
If it’s just the gender, then perhaps…? It is a composite skill that also includes the Divinity skill. The rank is B because she is a Pseudo-Servant inhabiting a vessel.

### Riding: A

All vehicles and all creatures but those of Phantasmal Beast and Divine Beast-rank can be used as mounts. Kama’s mount is said to be a parrot.
