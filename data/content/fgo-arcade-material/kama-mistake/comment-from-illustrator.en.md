The neat white dress was originally going to be her First Ascension but it had such a big impact that I decided to make it the Third Ascension. The more a certain individual kept requesting a black maid outfit the more I thought about Kama becoming a maid and decided to design it. I would like to line her up with Maid Alter and Saber Astolfo. While playing Arcade you’ll end up see a lot of the backside of the character your playing so I design with even the cuteness of the backside in mind and I think all three Ascensions came out cute. In My Room when Kama is bond 10 her expression changes all the time and it’s so cute. I’d like all of you to raise her to bond 10 and check it out (ReDrop)
