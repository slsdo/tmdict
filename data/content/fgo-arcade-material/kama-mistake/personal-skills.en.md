### Blessing of the Goddess: B

A gift from a (bad) Goddess. HP is plundered from an allied Servant and Kama is healed. Succu-succu.

“If you want a cute Angel of Love cheering you on, then I should be paid this much right?”

### Ananga: EX

Another name for Kama. A skill that represents being one without a body.
Long ago, an ashura called Tāraka tormented the gods. The gods knew only Shiva and Parvati’s child could defeat him, but Shiva was completely focused on his meditation and wouldn’t even glance at Parvati. Troubled, the gods dispatched Kama who shot Shiva with an arrow of love and he recovered his love for his wife. However, enraged by this act of Kama, Shiva opened his third eye and burned Kama to death. Having his body burned by Shiva, the god who can destroy all of creation or in other words, the universe, he was annihilated and reborn.
As a result Kama’s divinity was paradoxically proven to be the same as the universe.

“I don’t really understand, but I’m going to mess around so please do your best”

### Māra-Pāpīyās: EX

A Skill that temporarily displays another facet of Kama, her nature as the demon king who’s the incarnation of worldly desires. Kama, also known as Mara, is considered to be the other side of the same existence. There are times when they combine the two as Kama/Mara when talking about them.

“I’m compatible with the Assassin Class? Now then why is that? (Smiles)
