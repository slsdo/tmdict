### Independent Manifestation: D

The Skill to appear in the world without outside help.
It got lowered one rank from being a larval form and another from voluntarily rising from the sea to the land. Although she can manifest on her own, she needs (wants) as much magical energy from Master.

### Self Modification: EX

In her dragon form, Tiamat invalidates any attack with a rank lower than A++, but in her juvenile form, she can only maintain the dragon form for just a few minutes.
