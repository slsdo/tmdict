First Ascension: I was conscious of the even-toed silhouette of the heel, which seems difficult to walk with. I tried to balance the straight lines that bend at the eye level with the soft lines that hang down from the sleeves. The image is that of a white goat plus the feathers of a small bird.

Second Ascension: I recreated the original coloring and motif of Tiamat. She has a slightly mischievous image

Third Ascension: The incarnation of the warm ocean waters that sparkle and nurture life in the shallows. The glass jar is filled with seawater. She wears a cardigan and ribbon like clothes (Kotetsu Yamanaka)
