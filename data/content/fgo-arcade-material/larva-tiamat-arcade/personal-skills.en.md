### Infantile Regression: A

Due to turning into the “Daughter of Creation” from the “Mother of Creation”, the “self-Seal” skill has turned into this.

In exchange for losing a mighty power, the shackles of “being no longer needed by humanity” that she bound herself with have disappeared.
She might have returned to being a child, but the direction at her core of being the “Mother of All of Creation” has not changed.

While the Master might dote on her due to her being a child, she will pamper them ten times as much in return.

Kingprotea’s “Juvenile Regression” “returns her to her original state by converting the Saint Graph that has grown (proliferated) into NP”, but since juvenile form Tiamat’s skill is always active, in exchange for her Saint Graph not growing, she gains NP just by breathing. (More than the Avengers’ Self Restoration passive).

### Eyes of the Blue Planet: B

Something harboring the will of the planet (Earth), or perhaps the light dwelling within the intelligent lifeform that is the power of the planet itself.
The Earth’s version of what humans call “Mystic Eyes”.
Completely seals the critical hits and recovery actions of all targets within sight (3 turns).

### Eyes of the Red Planet: B

A more hostile and offense-oriented Mystic Eyes of the Planet. It changes Tiamat’s attack power and mana attribute while conferring a powerful curse to every target in sight.

### Sea of the Azure Planet: A

A version of the “Sea of Life” skill that is more geared towards protecting and nurturing humanity. It’s cool down is surprisingly short (2 turns at max). It reinforces the strength, mana, and Noble Phantasms of every party member, but Tiamat’s mana is fiercely consumed in the process.
