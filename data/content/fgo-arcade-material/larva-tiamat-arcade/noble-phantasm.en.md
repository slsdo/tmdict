Resolute Children, Resist The Logic Of Genesis.

An exceedingly straightforward and physical-oriented offensive Noble Phantasm where Tiamat temporarily returns to the “Sea of Life” before manifesting in her dragon form Saint Graph and pulverizing the enemy by releasing magical energy from that gigantic Saint Graph.

In any case, due to using up all of her strength, she switches to spoiled child mode afterwards and if her Master does not take care of her diligently she will start sulking.

It’s similar to Kingprotea’s Noble Phantasm but Kingprotea is a copy of Tiamat.
