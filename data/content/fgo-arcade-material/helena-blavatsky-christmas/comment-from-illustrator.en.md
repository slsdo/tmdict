Since the concept of “Snegurochka” was the starting point, I designed the character primarily with blue and white. FGO Arcade involves controlling 3D-modeled characters, so I aimed for a cute appearance with a fluffy, voluminous outfit adorned with boa and pompoms. I imagined this would look adorable in motion, and upon playing, I was moved to see it turned out even cuter than anticipated. I am truly grateful to the development staff. (Matsuryu)
