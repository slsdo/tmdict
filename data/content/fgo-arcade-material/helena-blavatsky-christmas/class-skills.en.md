### Magic Resistance: C

Cancels spells with a chant below two verses. Cannot defend against magecraft on the level of greater magecraft and Greater Rituals.

### Riding: A

Can freely control all beasts and vehicles. It seems she employs some form of magecraft, as she is able to ride even a materialized meteor. Generally, she cannot ride Phantasmal Beasts or Divine Beasts, but depending on the magecraft used, it might be possible to forcibly ride them.
