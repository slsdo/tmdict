### Midwinter Mahatma: A

Even after changing her form, her talent remains intact. Just as in her Caster form, she connects to and manipulates numerous magecraft foundations freely…

However, her magecraft tends to evoke the imagery of “winter” and “snow.” It seems that her mental restraints automatically activate due to her costume as Snegurochka. Helena herself appears to be vaguely aware of that herself.

### Snowfield Combat: C+

Inspired by the movements of Holmes (Sigerson) she witnessed in her lifetime. Essentially, it’s a mimicry of Bartitsu in snow.

Helena mentions that although it didn’t work well at all during her time as a Caster, her modified Spirit Origin seems to have had a positive effect, as she now moves smoothly as she desires. With the use of magecraft considerably more limited compared to her time as a Caster, she might have more magical energy available for hand-to-hand combat.

### Santa Olcott: A+

With the change in her Spirit Origin, the Olcott dolls have also changed. While they can no longer be mass-produced in real-time through the Item Construction skill, the Olcott dolls in Santa mode possess a certain level of combat ability. Similar to acquiring the Snowfield Combat skill, with the use of magecraft considerably more limited compared to her time as a Caster, there might be more magical energy available to allocate to the Olcott dolls.
