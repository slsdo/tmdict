Meteor Snegurochka.
It’s a fir tree (Yolka) used as a mount by Helena Blavatsky after changing her Spirit Origin.

Whether it’s a sublimation of some legend surrounding the snow maiden Snegurochka or influenced by Helena’s imagination about the ancient Slavic gods is unclear.

A continuously active Noble Phantasm.
While primarily a flying function Noble Phantasm and not intended for offensive use, it can unleash a high-speed ramming attack wrapped in magical energy upon unlocking its True Name. The appearance of this assault is akin to a shooting star.
