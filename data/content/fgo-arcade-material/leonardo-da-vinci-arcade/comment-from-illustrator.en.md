Finally implemented in the arcade version! I remember being surprised because it was said that there were no plans for her to be playable. Later, it was planned to use the same illustration for FGO, but re-drawing it didn’t feel right… so I created a new one. I remember being told that a sailor uniform with roller skates would be good and I struggled to make it not look like a certain magical girl… When I watched the gameplay video, I found myself nodding in approval at her cuteness, feeling like a proud father. I’m single, though. (Simosi)
