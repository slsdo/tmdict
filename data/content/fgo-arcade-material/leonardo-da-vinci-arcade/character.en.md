### Setting

A fabricated Heroic Spirit forged by Da Vinci. A “Mona Lisa-inspired artificial entity”. Considering the “dark clouds beyond 2017” expected after the Human Order Incineration Incident, Da Vinci made a copy of herself just in case.

Da Vinci, operating in Chaldea without a Master (defining her doll as her Master), was only possible due to Chaldea’s power supply.
If she were to venture outside Chaldea on an exploratory journey, she had devised a “substitute” to support Fujimaru and the others in her absence.
Da Vinci completed Young Da Vinci not with knowledge from her lifetime but with the new technology gained after being summoned to Chaldea. Young Da Vinci, more akin to a homunculus or golem than a Heroic Spirit, has taken on Da Vinci’s role entirely. She can operate almost like a human without needing a Master. While her versatility has decreased due to her miniaturization, it’s like, “You can’t reach the top shelf when you’re a child, right? It’s that kind of thing.” The breadth of knowledge (genres) she can possess hasn’t changed, but her reach is shallow. If she focuses on an event for a long time, she can achieve the same things as before, but for You Da Vinci, “there’s no time for that.”

### Personality

Similar to Da Vinci but with a slightly stronger girlishness. Her language is softer, and she sometimes mixes in girly endings in her sentences.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She acts as an advisor to help Master, and sometimes as an older or younger sister, behaving in a bright, cheerful, and brilliant manner.

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

Anyway, she’s all about energy and sass. She dashes across the battlefield on roller skates, wielding the Ultimo Manipulator deployed from her versatile bag, fighting as a pure and lovely hybrid Servant.
“Who is she, you ask? Well, of course, she’s the clone crafted by the all-purpose genius, Leonardo da Vinci, in preparation for the Second Grand Order. She’s the top-secretarial beauty supporting Chaldea’s Master on the surface of the Earth. It’s everyone’s girl, Da Vinci-chan!”
In close combat, she uses the manipulator for brawling. At medium range, she extends the manipulator’s claws and hurls its circular drum section. For long-range attacks, she uses beams from the manipulator and commands pigeons as funnels.
