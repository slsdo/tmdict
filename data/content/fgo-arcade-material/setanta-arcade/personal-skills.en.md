### Knight of the Red Branch: B

Setanta is particularly conscious of being a member of the “Red Branch Knights,” a group of brave and free-spirited warriors from Ulster.

### Hound-Slayer: A

This skill is derived from the legend of Setanta’s youth, where he was called “Cú Chulainn”, named after killing the fierce hound of Culann. It’s a variant of the Beast Slayer skill, giving him an advantage against wild beasts.

### Shadowland Arms Mastery: B+

The days of training under Scáthach, the mistress of the Land of Shadows, tempered Setanta’s mind and body, leading him to become the unparalleled hero Cú Chulainn. This skill is possessed because this incarnation represents him during his training period (strictly speaking, just before completing his training). If he were to manifest as the true hero Cú Chulainn, he would not possess this skill but would instead have the Noble Phantasm Gáe Bolg. (It should be inherently impossible to have a state where he possesses neither this skill nor the Noble Phantasm Gáe Bolg.)
