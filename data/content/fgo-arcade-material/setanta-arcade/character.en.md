### Personality

A bright, cheerful, and action-oriented wild child. Setanta acts before worrying too much. Despite his wild nature, he is well-mannered towards his elders and adults, thanks to the thorough education from his foster father Fergus and his teacher Scáthach. When no one is watching, he acts freely and unrestrained.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Setanta treats his Master like a close friend. This approach is his optimal way of interacting with someone close his age. He has no particular wish for the Holy Grail, knowing that the desire to become the greatest hero can only be fulfilled by himself.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m Setanta! Well, I also go by the name Cú Chulainn… But I’m still too inexperienced to be called the Hound of Culann or the greatest hero of Ulster. So, it’s Setanta. Nice to meet you!”
“The Holy Grail? Isn’t that Dagda’s cauldron? Huh, I see. So it’s just a difference in name? Something about region or culture? Ah, but I still don’t get it.”
“…I really wanna use Gáe Bolg!”

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

In Celtic mythology, specifically the Ulster Cycle, Setanta is depicted as the great hero Cú Chulainn during his training period. His body and mind are younger and more immature compared to when he manifests as a Lancer or Caster. However, he also holds the infinite potential of a young boy striving to become someone greater.

This period is after his battle with the Hound of Culann, but he has not fully accepted the renowned title “Cú Chulainn” as his own. This might be because his teacher, Scáthach, the mistress of the Land of Shadows and the greatest spear wielder, continues to call him “Setanta.”

Although he doesn’t have clear memories of his future, he generally recognizes the historical facts as records. Unlike the young Alexander, who manifests in a similar state, Setanta dismisses notions of history or human records with a carefree attitude saying things like “History or human records or whatever, I don’t care.”, “My future is mine alone.”, and “Medb? No way I’ll be killed by someone like her!” He is entirely unwilling to accept his future, maintaining a defiant stance towards Medb.
