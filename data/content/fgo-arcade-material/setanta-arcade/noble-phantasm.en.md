Cruadín Setanta.
When recognized as a warrior of Ulster, Setanta was granted an unnamed sword by King Conchobar, which has become identical to the light sword Cruaidín mentioned in the legend of the “Battle of Rosnaree.”

This magical sword emits a faint light. Upon invoking its True Name, it shines intensely, demonstrating power comparable to the magical sword Caladbolg wielded by his foster father Fergus. Using the formidable combat techniques learned from his teacher Scáthach, Setanta wields this sword to utterly defeat his targets. In this summoning, where the Spirit Origin has been established as Setanta, the True Name of the hero that would become Cú Chulainn, it is considered that the two swords have merged into one Noble Phantasm due to the commonality of being wielded in battle by him.

“This sword, isn’t it actually the one I used later on? Isn’t that unfair?” “Well, lots of guys have unfair Noble Phantasms anyway, so whatever!” -Such was said by Setanta
