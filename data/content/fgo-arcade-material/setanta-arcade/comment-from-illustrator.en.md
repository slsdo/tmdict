As my favorite character from “Fate/stay night” was always Cú Chulainn, I felt an incredible amount of pressure while designing Setanta. When he was first revealed in the arcade version, I remember being deeply moved seeing him energetically move around in 3D on the actual machine. Aiming to create a classic, feel-good boy hero while incorporating various elements of Cú Chulainn, we eventually arrived at the current design. By the way, the white puppy is included as Setanta’s companion growing up, based on the episode where he raised the child of Culann’s fierce hound until it became an adult. (lack)
