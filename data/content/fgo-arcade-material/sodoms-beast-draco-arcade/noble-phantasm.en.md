  <tr><td>Range</td><td>1~30</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>7 people</td></tr>

The Beast ver. of Nero’s Domus Aurea. The “seven people” in the number of targets means it works against the 7 Classes. After locking the opponent inside the Golden Theater, she pulverizes the whole theater with them in it.
