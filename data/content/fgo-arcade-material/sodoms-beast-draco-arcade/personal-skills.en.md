### Number of the Beast: C

A downgraded version of Beast VI’s Personal Skill. The Number of the Beast, 666, engraved on herself. Grants herself regular NP increases for 6 turns, crit damage+ 6 times, and damage cut 6 times.

### Seven Beastly Crowns: C

Horns that symbolize the Beast of Revelations, the blasphemer, the destroyer of cities. They correspond to each of her seven crowns, boosting the unique abilities of each of them. Each individual buff is weak, but the more she uses this Skill, the more it improves the power of the later buffs. The seventh buff’s power will be tremendous.

### Aurea Poculum: C

The corrupted Grail incessantly boiling with human desires - for fortune, alcohol, gold, spouses, lovers… Adds charge to all enemies, but in exchange, halves their HP.
