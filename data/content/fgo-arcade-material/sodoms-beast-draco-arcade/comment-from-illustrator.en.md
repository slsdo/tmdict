### Draco

It’s her Lily!!!!!! She obviously needed the wickedness of a Beast but since she’s a larval form, I also wanted to make her cute… There’s just so much I wanted to do… Her headaches have gotten beyond bad, her scales hurt her skin, and nothing can bring her enjoyment. What I drew was a small tiny Nero who sits on the throne enduring all that without letting it show in her face. I wanted her to look dignified, so I decided against including some elements, but in hindsight, she could stand to be a little more visibly in pain. Her outfit is called Red Lightning UPDATED♥. (Wada Arco)

### Sodom’s Beast

She has unhealthily pale skin, a face with no energy, and her eyes are the only part of her that shines. For her expressions, I was trying to make faces of mockery, contempt, delight, and Nero’s characteristic solitude and despondency, with a layer of sordidness you can’t find anywhere else in the Arthuria archetype. The armor pushing up her chest has wolf breasts on it. The crimson covering Beast VI’s limbs and fur starts from her neck. The flames coming out of her feet have the yellow color of sulfur, with dashes of green gold to resemble the Japanese harlot Sasae. (Yamanaka Koutetsu)
