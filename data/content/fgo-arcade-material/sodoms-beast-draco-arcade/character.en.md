### Personality

A cruel queen. Always in a foul mood. She’s a tyrant, but never upheaves regulations or breaks pacts. All due to her natural overseriousness. In her fully developed state, she might savor the corruption of humanity with a satisfied grin, but the larval Sodom’s Beast derives no recreation or satisfaction from watching human corruption. Despite being the larval form of the lapse-spreading Beast VI, she despises filth, despises sloth, despises futility (since she despises futile struggles, she consequently despises combat too), and antagonizes passion (only antagonizes, doesn’t despise). She’ll never let it show, but deep inside she’s anxiously waiting for the arrival of someone who can dispel the temptation and become a constant light of hope, no matter how small. She’s the ultimate cool-heart tsundere, but she’ll never show her dere side.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Nero Beast reincarnated as an Alterego. She has no interest in reblooming as Beast VI but remains present to watch the future of the human who felled her (be it ruin or glory). In short, she has a strong sense of responsibility.

### Dialogue Examples

The calamity comes out of the sea. Watch closely, this is the response to your prosperity. The conclusion to your desires built upon blood and riches.

I expect nothing from you. Meet a pathetic end.

Ask not for my opinions. My only word for you is “Die”.

Put me not in futile fights. Show me no displays of futility. My head hurts.

… Quite the pleasant scream I heard. I’m salivating.

### Setting

One of the two horns of the sixth Beast. The Sixth Beast defeated in one parallel world by the Chaldeas of numerous parallel worlds. The one born from the logos of Lapse. Legend goes that when the city that reached the peak prosperity of its era begins to rot, she appears to savor its malice. Her name is Sodom’s Beast. The Beast who ruined Babylon in the New Testament.
