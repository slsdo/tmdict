### Authority of the Beast: C

The Skill also called Anti-Humanity. Reduces the damage dealt by Heroic Spirits or Divine Spirits involved with mankind.

### Independent Manifestation: E

The Skill to independently appear in the present world. This Beast is a capricious one, so ruining one city is enough to leave her satisfied. Also, this Skill expresses the state of “already existing in every timeline” so it not only negates time paradoxes and other forms of attacks done using time travel, but also cancels all kinds of insta-death attacks.

### Nega-Messiah: EX

A Skill that mankind appended to her for being the Anti-Christ. Negates all blessings from faith. It also comes with an advantage trait against the Extra Class of the saviors, and a hidden ability to weaken their special Skills.
