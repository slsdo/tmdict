### Personality

#### Nemo

Nemo as an adult.
His cool tone, mannerisms, and reactions are nothing like they were in “FateGO”.
Yet some of that personality remains in that young adult body of his.
Even a seemingly cold response (unwelcoming treatment) is something akin to a strict kindness, done out of consideration of “the response to the situation to come” rather than the other person’s “current feelings”.
Nemo the Captain is also a person of patience and fixation, so his attachment to those he trusts is very strong. (He’s a caring person, and he sulks when not cared about in return)

In addition, as he has fused with Noah,

- He has acquired a weakness to alcohol, yet still wants to drink it. And then strips down.
- The animals get annoyed at him constantly getting closer and closer to them.
- He wants to get matching things with Master.
- He becomes more erotic.

Stuffs like that have also been added. He’s really getting out of control now.

#### Noah

Honest and gentle. He looks like a young man, but he is mentally 600 years old.
If it is for a good cause, he is willing to make great sacrifices, and to perform superhuman-like labors.
He sometimes mocks himself, saying that he is just a mere farmer chosen by the Lord.
He has a weakness for alcohol, and is quick to strip down easily.
His sleeping posture is so erotic that it causes ceaseless trouble for those around him.
He is friendly with animals, though he is often attacked and beaten by them whenever they’re in the mood.
Whether it’s sweaters or mug cups, everything has to be a pair for him.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As Nemo the Captain, he is a military instructor who oftentimes coolly and calmly guides the Master.
Though strict, and at times heroic, he coaches his Master much in the ways of tactics and survival.
Having grown into a young adult, the deep-seated part of him which makes him prone to loneliness rarely makes itself known anymore.
Because of his respect for Noah, he doesn’t let a single word slip about Noah’s mischievous behaviors.

As Noah, most of the above washes away, and he becomes a friend who constantly clings to his Master’s side.
With consideration, and at times irritation, he watches over and intervenes in the Master’s daily life.
He will do things that Nemo doesn’t usually (or cannot) do.
Because he adores Nemo the Captain (captain, so cool!), he is happy to be called “Captain Nemo”.

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

An “adult” Nemo summoned in the role of “Grand Rider”.
Originally, Grand Rider “Noah” was to conquer the Seventh/Copycat Singularity, but because of Beast VI’s interference, it was not possible to summon Noah on his own, and so “Nemo Triton”, who was registered as a Heroic Spirit by Throne of Heroes due to a certain achievement of his{{n2}}, offered his body to allow him manifest in the Seventh/Copycat Singularity.
Strangely enough, despite not being summoned in Novum Chaldea, he was still summoned as a mixture of Heroic Spirits— or, a Phantom Spirit.
The First and Second Ascensions are just “Nemo Triton as an adult”, with none of the elements from “Heroic Spirit Noah” present.
At the Third Ascension, he fully merges with Noah’s character and nature and becomes “Nemo Noah”.

Furthermore, since he was not summoned by Sion, he does not possess his team as an extension of Memory Partition.
Normally, he acts as Nemo, but in serious moments, such as during the decisive battle for the salvation of the Human Order, he activates “Noah Mode” by his very own will and judgment, wholly turning him into a incredibly brilliant version of Nemo.

#### As Nemo

A matured, adult Nemo.
Basically the same as FGO’s Captain. He prefers being in solitude and expresses noble behaviors.
He still harbors an intense desire for vengeance against the British colonizers who took away his homeland as well as his wife and child, but Noah’s nature keeps him rational and restrained.

#### As Heroic Spirit Noah

Noah is “a righteous man who is obedient to God, a blameless one”{{n3}}.
He has a strong sense of awareness as a Grand Rider, and strives for the salvation of the Human Order.
Specifically, Noah views the Counter Force that harasses (uses) him, as the same kind of Justice as the Lord’s prophecy, and tries his best to fulfill his mission.
However, he secretly regrets deep in his heart that he was only able to bring himself and his family into the Ark, and left other fallen people to die (even the Lord regretted His actions and promised to never do it again).

Nemo is deeply affected by the aforementioned factors.
In conclusion, it’s no different from “fulfill the mission of kindness and strive to save lives” that Nemo usually does, but there are subtle differences.

In the case of Nemo Triton, as Triton admires the (cool) Captain Nemo, Nemo becomes a sharp and quippy captain as a result. (He is more sincere than Nemo from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. He is also not an eccentric bigot.)

In the case of Nemo Noah, Noah’s remorse was so strong that he pushed his own anger and vengeance behind, and so he becomes a captain of Justice who saves lives (for Noah’s sake too).

……If Noah is summoned as a Heroic Spirit on his own, and Nemo is also there on support, Nemo would be able to read and comfort Noah, who is trying to blindly fulfill his mission without any regard for the sacrifices.

### Biography of Noah

The tenth generation of the Sons of God since Adam.
According to Jewish folktales, the “patriarchs”{{n4}} from Adam to Noah had an extremely long life span of over 900 years old.
Upon receiving the Lord’s prophecy lamenting over mankind’s wickedness and depravity, Noah did as he was foretold and built the Ark, bringing with him all kinds of birds and animals as well as his own family (his wife, his three sons, and the sons’ wives).
The Ark, as its name suggests, is box-shaped, with one theory speculating that its dimension is 135 m (length) × 23 m (width) × 14 m (height). But he couldn’t steer a boat, and so he had to leave the destination to the Lord after the flood drifted him away.
The storm that lasted for 40 days sank the earth, and with it all living creatures blotted out. After 150 days of drifting, the waters gradually receded, and the Ark came to rest on the summit of Mount Ararat. And after another 40 days, Noah released ravens and doves to confirm the presence of the land.
Noah’s descendants then built the new civilizations, and became the Progenitors of Humanity.

### Anecdotes on Noah

・The name “Noah” means ”to comfort” in Hebrew{{n5}}.

・He inherited a shining stone called ”Zohar” (“radiance”) from his ancestors.

・He has a loose side, as it was said that he got attacked by a lion on the Ark for neglecting to feed them, resulting in one of his legs crippled.

・After the Great Flood, he became a farmer growing vineyards, and is considered as the founder of agriculture.

・After Noah drank the wine he made, he was seen by his son Ham, lying ugly drunk and completely uncovered. He then blessed the other brothers who covered him with a garment without seeing his nakedness, and cursed Ham’s son Canaan{{n6}}.

### Anecdotes on the Ark

・The word “ark” in Hebrew is “tēbāh”, which means “a promised vessel protected by God”.

・The Ark’s material, “Gopherwood” (“Wood of Gofer”), is spoken nowhere else in the Holy Bible{{n7}}, and thus its origin is still unknown. There are many theories about the tree it was from, such as some kind of sacred tree, Lebanon cedars, pine trees, and reeds.

・The “crow” is a “raven”{{n8}}. The “pigeon” is not a “pigeon” (house pigeon) but rather a “dove” (mountain dove). It’s also especially believed to be a “turtle dove” or a “collared dove”.

### Connections with Characters

#### Moses

“Eeh, a descendant of my son Shem? Uwaaah…He has a neat face and is rather viole—…..I mean, wiiiild.
He smashed stone tablets with his bare hands, and even parted the Red Sea? I wonder who he took it from?
His descendant Judge Samson too, I heard he was also famous for his unparalleled strength.
I see. When I think about it, Grandpa Methuselah was also an aggressive person, so it’s probably running through our veins—”
(Upon hearing another of Noah’s bloodline jokes, the animals move away. David is approaching.)

#### Leonardo da Vinci

“I’d be a little nervous if I stood next to his, errr, her? side, I guess.
Right, that. Speaking of which, on the matter of the geological layers of fossils he discovered, which he fumbled in the manuscripts he left behind{{n9}}……Yes, the Great Flood.
“Why do we find sea fossils in the mountains? It’s wrong to attribute it to Noah’s Great Flood!” I’m afraid that one all-powerful genius will pester me.
Still, he is pious. In his later years, he made several sketches of deluges and floods{{n10}}. So in his views on nature, the End of the World has always been associated with the biblical image of the Great Flood. Flood talks, wonder when we can do it……”

#### Old Man of the Mountain

“….It’s strange. It’s as if Death has taken a human form, with a frightening appearance devoid of life. He also seems somewhat nostalgic. He probably doesn’t drink alcohol, either.
But, it’s not like he wouldn’t eat anything. I’ll go visit him with some of my favorite date palms{{n11}}.”

#### Taigong Wang

“(is already drunk) Grand, fufu, Crown (Grand)……being a Rider is great, but working on fields is great too, ya know? Wheat fields support our tomorrow. Olive trees brighten our lives. And above all, grapes! Vineyards soothe our hearts. I want to beee~ Grand Farmer. Eeeh~? Who is it? Grand Drunkard?”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} This “kimi” is written in kanji unlike what mobile Nemo used. However, in the Babylon Section 2 pre-fight scene, Captain used “kimi” in katakana. Unlike other text errors in Arcade’s story mode, this was never fixed. Wonder what that means.
2. {{note2}} Refer to Nemo’s own Materials XI profile, “Character Portrayal in Fate/GO” section.
3. {{note3}} Paraphrased from Genesis 6:9.
4. {{note4}} While Jewish “patriarchs” more commonly refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, [the title can be used to refer to the twenty male ancestor figures between Adam and Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchs_(Bible)). The first ten generations, from Adam to Noah, are further specified as “antediluvian patriarchs”.
5. {{note5}} The original Hebrew is נחמה (“noach”). It can also mean “to relief” and “to rest”. See also Genesis 5:29.
6. {{note6}} Read Genesis 9:20-27 for the whole story.
7. {{note7}} Genesis 6:14, continue reading to verses 15 and 16 for the whole specs.
8. {{note8}} This is probably a reference to Ibuki’s comment on Tunguska Sanctuary where she tried to remember Noah’s Ark story in Section 12 Arrow 3. She used カラス (crow) in the Japanese version, while in NA’s translation she gets the “raven” part right. Or you can read this anecdote as Meteo’s criticizing the Japanese translation of Book of Genesis, whatever.
9. {{note9}} Codex Leicester, Da Vinci’s unpublished journal he compiled between 1504 to 1510 when he was working for Ludovico Sforza in Milan.
10. {{note10}} [Deluge over a City](https://www.leonardodavinci.net/deluge-over-a-city.jsp) and [Drawing of a Flood]()
11. {{note11}} [Date palms (Phoenix dactylifera)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm). I’m assuming he is bringing the dried date palm fruits that are usually consumed during Ramadan to break the fast.
