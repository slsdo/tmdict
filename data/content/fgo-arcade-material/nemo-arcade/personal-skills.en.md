### Voyager of the Storm: B
The Skill possessed by Nemo the Captain. As Noah is not a captain who steers the Ark, this Skill doesn’t add up to Noah’s prowess.

### Voyager of Salvation: B

The Skill of Noah, who lived through the storm and brought salvation by preserving many lives.
Fundamentally different from Nemo’s seamanship, it is a principle of protection and of preservation.

### Protection of the Faith: EX

The Skill of Noah, who was chosen by the Lord as a righteous man. Only those who are martyred for their religious belief have it. While this Skill in and of itself doesn’t benefit from the grace of the supreme existence, Noah actually draws a lot of benefits from it. He is truly a special exception.

### Zohar’s Radiant Jewel{{n1}}: EX

A shining stone indicating one as a descendant of Adam. By itself, the Jewel displays no great power. However, it responds brilliantly to Noah’s spirit, which is untainted by Evil, nurtures the Earth, and loves the animals, and bestows him the power worthy for “Progenitor of Humanity”.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The Skill’s name is ゾハールの輝石 but the design note on the pendant calls it 輝石ゾハール (“Radiant Jewel Zohar”). So I settled it by flipping the words around.
