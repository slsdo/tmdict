Noah’s Ark. Or, Daath Noah’s Ark.
Washes away the enemy with violent storms and overwhelming water currents.
After all has been submerged, the Ark rises above the surface of the water like a submarine, a dove returns to Noah’s side with an olive branch, and a rainbow appears across the clear skies as a proof of the Covenant.
The animals are also delighted.

Great Ram Noah’s Ark.
An Ark drifting across the sea of storms.
The blocks that divide the huge Ark, slides and transforms into an oddly-shaped humanoid reminiscent of the Wisdom Angel Cherubim.
At the end of its arm and charged with thunderclap lightning is the Nautilus’ drill attack. In addition, wild beasts and birds of prey also follow its chase.
