### Abhijñā: B (A)

The portion of a God’s power.

It is manifested through the power to telekinetically manipulate any objects in the vicinity at one’s will; its original capacities have been downgraded from its original rank due to her current manifestation within a Servant container.

Given its suitability for the mass delivery of presents, it has great potential for her Santa duties if wisely applied.

However, since what Suzuka wants to grant is not presents, but love, such application will never see the light of day.

That said, she thinks it’d be nice to hand out sweets and toys to the children, but she wouldn’t accept any other way than doing so personally.

### Love Confiserie: A

A variant on the Mystic Eyes Skill.

The pair of Mystic Eyes held by Suzuka Gozen were ones originally endowed with the effect to charm the target into fostering romantic feelings towards her. However, this time, what they spur upon the target is an intense yearn for the very idea of romance itself.

Rather than directing the target’s feelings of love, it instead magnifies the spellbound target’s current romantic feelings.

While the Nosy Suzuka recognises that love can at times be bittersweet, she suggests that it should be usually sweet, sparkly, and flowery.

Due to the increased rank of this skill, avoiding the effects of her Mystic Eyes is now a difficult task to accomplish.

### Blessings of the Holy Night: C

The range of her Blessings of Wisdom forcibly spreads to encompass the entire party, except for herself.

“A Santa that isn’t spreading joy for everyone else is major fake vibes!”, it’s her proclaimed symbol of pride.
