A variant of Suzuka Gozen’s threefold swordplay technique made specially to match the Christmas holidays.

The Daitouren and Shoutouren were both merged to be reborn as “Ryoutsuren-that-sparkles-with-brilliance” and Kenmyouren remodeled - after the twinkling stars motif - into the “Kenpouren”.

Trichiliovesickosm is the combined technique of these paired spears.

When she deploys this Noble Phantasm, Suzuka materialises her feelings of cheering for those that love in the form of a so-called Loveroom, causing the area around her to be affected by a field of effects.

To be more specific, Kenpouren’s ability serves to make the stars glide around, and Ryoutsuren’s ability is to bring about the snowfall. Basically setting up the most Christmas-like atmosphere ever.

Not distinguishing between friend and foe, all within her Loveroom are subject to Suzuka’s influence; those supported by her will be granted a morale and stamina boost, while those that aren’t will end up having their abilities constrained, as they will be seen as homewreckers.

It’s also worth noting that in exchange for being able to employ it during the night and enacting its effects upon others, the potential originally possessed by the Noble Phantasm Kenpouren has been greatly reduced.

On the bright side, she can now deploy it with without depending on her Blessings of Wisdom, so everything is fine.
