### Personality

Originally the overserious and thoughtful type of girl, she would be more than satisfied masking herself with the self-centered and shortsighted high schoolgirl pretense.

She is constantly busy, committed to honing her girliness for her yet-to-be-seen soulmate.

But, since she is a giver at heart, those self-centred gestures were, in most of the cases, actually backed up by a desire to help out those around her.

Santa Suzuka is Suzuka’s, aforementioned, selfless nature brought to the surface.

A Suzuka who puts other people’s love before her own and supports them wholeheartedly.

There might be some instances where you will see her conflating Santa with the Angel of Love, but that’s because there is really no distinction between the two roles from her perspective.

To make everyone happy and make them learn about their own feelings is to kill two birds with one stone.

However, this does not mean that Suzuka will jump into any and all love affairs that ask for her assistance. Though they’re friends, Kiyohime’s love-hate issue is one of the cases she wrinkles her nose about. That is something she doesn’t want to shoulder any responsibility for or have the slightest involvement with.

…Don’t get it wrong, Suzuka is taking her Santa role pretty seriously, but she is a bit of a klutz when it comes to love, so don’t expect any meaningful support coming from her.

To summarise, that’s a much happier Suzuka than what would normally be seen in her Saber Saint Graph.

Her Summer Saint Graph would be the most carefree compared of all her versions, by the way. Due to some miscalculations on her part, she becomes just a little more self-servicing compared to her original self.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She becomes much more of a busybody towards her Master than ever.

Constantly forcing them into girls’ talk and dragging them into sessions of love counseling.

Just like in her Saber version, she will not develop any romantic feelings towards her Master. They may further their bond, but the little step just before “love” will be their max level.

### Dialogue Examples

“Isn’t Christmas, like, the biggest holiday for lovebirds?”

“Hm? The tan gal is just for looks, though.”

“girl’s-fidelity-talk!”

“Love tips? That’s totally on me, I’m like super good at it! No worries, I’ve got everything covered!”

“May the yuletide stars steer the way and the heartbeat hue the wintry night with sweetness. Christmas is the Day-Z, so lemme give you a push! Thrichiliolovesickcosm!”

“O Stars, cast your radiance upon the inner depths of one’s heart. Can you hear itーKonkonn? The snow’s inspiring whisper? Well, that’s mine… yuletide crystals of snow that harbingers love! Thrichiliolovesickcosm!”

“Merry Christmas, Master. Say, how about I give you some sweet love too… Nah, no way!”

Your Heavenly Princess fully awakened to her truth.

No way… Am I, like, really pulling the JK Santa off?!

Anyway, yeah. It’s hella hard give up on summer like that, especially when it’s totes calling for me. Plus, I’d hate giving the lamefox something to laugh about.

However, Christmas is a super big event for lovebirds! So no way I’m gonna bail on that!

Anyway, did you know? Suzuka Gozen became a Santa.

Namely, a Love Deliverer.

Chaldea Suzuka’s worldview is one that considers the act of martyr yourself in devotion to love to be the supreme bliss one could attain within their lifetime.

With that in mind, it’s only natural that she would want to share her treasured happiness with her beloved friends.

While she claims that her intention is to distribute love, that doesn’t mean she will resort to any dirty tricks, such as brainwashing two people into intimacy.

Because of that, one of the methods utilised by this Santa of Love is the subspecies of her charming-type mystic eyes, the Love Confiserie skill.

Just a sweet guidance that, by merely enhancing the sentiments of love that they already had within themselves, temporarily alters the intensity in which the target yearns for love on itself.

“Like, you gotta be the one putting your feelings out there, otherwise there’s no meaning, yes? I only stick my nose to set up the mood and stuff!”

That’s basically Suzuka’s view on romance.

Although she is quite the annoying girl, she is, more or less, an earnest one deep down.

### General Armaments

Ryoutsuren/Kenmyouren.

The paired spears wielded by her, actually wielded by her abhijñā.

Ryoutsuren’s shiny edges leave the prettiest trails of light when swung around, and it even has some writings to show. Sparkle is the soul of Christmas, after all.

Also, since this version of Suzuka doesn’t make use of her Blessings of Wisdom, her fighting style is much sloppier and flashier than usual.

### Connections with Characters

#### Katsushika Hokusai (Saber)

I always try to get her to have some girls’ talk with me, but she keeps running from me.

Well, no biggie! Not gonna hold back just because she’s a Saber now! Gotta use all my Lancer-smooth moves to stick on her and definitely get some girls’ talk to bloom between us!

#### Tamamo Cat

Even I am not that clueless. Never gonna ask that Dumb cat to do girls’ talk with me.

…maybe I should gift her a carrot instead?

#### Benienmma

Ah, Bennie!

I’d totally accept some Christmas snacks to liven up the mood andーHm? Then how about I attend to Chaldea’s cookery lessons? Ah nono, I didn’t mean I wanna LEARN how to cook I justーHuh?

Hell’s Kitchen?… Wait a sec, Teach… Please no! Teach Beni, no!

#### Tamamo no Mae

…Will not waste my breath on the lamefox.

#### Kiyohime

Kiyohi? In her case it’s way past love, it’s love-hate for real. She’s more like flaring than sparkling.

#### Sei Shounagon / Oda Nobunaga / Okita Souji

Everytime my gal gang is up, the xmas mood skyrockets! They’re the best!

Well, they do get a bit cray when they get too hyped, but they’re still cool.

#### Georgius

One day he came up to me for some selfie tips. He’s super sweet.

#### Queen Medb

Mebby is totes girlboss but I really worry about the way she doesn’t take care of herself?

I do wanna be friends with her and all, but I’m still kinda torn about it.

By the way, every time I see her I go like “Medb! MEDBY! MEBBBYYYYY” and she shoots me back the nastiest look. I just love when she does that.

#### Child Servants

Line up, line up! It’s gift time!

It’s just the best to see the little ones’ smiles! I’m basically the Hero of Benefaction now! Wait that didn’t come out right. Huh…
