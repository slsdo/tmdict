### Magic Resistance: C

Nullifies any magecraft with incantation below two verses.

Unable to defend against more sophisticated spells, such as greater magecraft or ritual curses.

### Riding: B

Talent for riding.

She can effortlessly drive most of the average mounts, save for phantasmal species.

### Divinity: A

The aptitude of one’s body for divine qualities.

She already possesses natural high divinity, so its rank would hardly change upon the class swapping.
