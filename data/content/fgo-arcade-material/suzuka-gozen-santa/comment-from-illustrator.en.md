Originally I was instructed to design a trendy tan gal-santa with traditional Japanese arrange, but I thought that if we’d go with a schoolgirl fashion, we might as well go for something a bit more modern-like… so I proposed a chunk of designs that’d lean a bit more to Western or Japanese fashion and Takeuchi, surprisingly, counterproposed with something that combined both in an East-meets-West style! The guy’s a genius! By the way, Suzuka is commonly known as the type of character who doesn’t like to wear underwear, right? Well, you see, her concern is more that she hates VPL showing up, but that she can brush that off if it’s looking good enough. I also suggested some summoning and Noble Phantasm animations that I thought it’d look cool in 3D models, but I didn’t expect all of it to be implemented like that. The 3D modeling and motions were just adorable! It was super cool, thank you so much! (Takenoko Seijin)
