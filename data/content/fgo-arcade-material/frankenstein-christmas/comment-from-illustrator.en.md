Since players see the back view of the character most of the time in the arcade version, we aimed for a design with a cute back view. The character is in 3D and moves quickly, so we focused on creating a form that stands out from other characters. In fact, this version of Fran has a brighter expression and more variations than previous designs. However, since there haven’t been many opportunities to showcase these expressions directly, I’m happy to finally present them. (Takeshi Okazaki)
