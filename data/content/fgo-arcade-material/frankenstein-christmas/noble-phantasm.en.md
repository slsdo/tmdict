Festival Flower Girl Present!
A blessing Noble Phantasm that activates when the overly excited Fran-chan reaches her peak excitement. It affects both allies and enemies indiscriminately, but strangely, it deals physical damage to enemies while providing buffs and healing to allies. As befitting the name “Blooming Maiden,” vibrant flower petals are scattered along with the presents. Additionally, bombs are delivered to enemies.

Bridal Chest Santa.
A slightly Santa Claus-themed modification of Maiden’s Chastity. With each strike, bells jingle, stars appear from nowhere, and candy cane-like sweets are scattered. In “Fate/GO,” it is primarily used as a regular weapon.
