### Personality

Her personality is closer to Frankenstein in her Swimsuit Spirit Origin. She speaks in a sluggish manner but is quite intelligent. She throws presents with great strength and scatters them rather roughly. It’s so much fun!

### Dialogue Examples

“I-am-Sa-n-ta! Roar!”
“I’ve brought presents, so celebrate and honor them.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Originally, she is a character from Mary Shelley’s novel “Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,” known as the nameless monster.

Dr. Victor Frankenstein stitched together a creature from corpses and brought it to life using the power of lightning.

In the novel, she is a scientifically created monster. However, in this work, Victor Frankenstein truly exists as a man who combined alchemy and science to create artificial life.

The purpose of creating an artificial human was to recreate the original human, Adam. The “her” summoned as a Servant was created as Eve to bear Adam. However, this endeavor ended in failure. The girl, unable to control her emotions and exhibiting extreme ferocity, was deemed a failure by Dr. Frankenstein.

The problem was that she was an uncontrollable monster even the doctor could not handle. Despite her lack of emotions and fierce nature, she was not foolish, but Dr. Frankenstein did not acknowledge this and fled.

The girl defined her reason for existence as the purpose Dr. Frankenstein told her: to become the mother of Adam. However, for this, she needed a partner, and the only one capable of creating such a partner was Dr. Frankenstein himself.

An endless pursuit.

The girl has declared. The doctor should bear responsibility and guilt. Responsibility for creating her and guilt for abandoning her.

Although the doctor refuses, saying he cannot create another monster in this world, the girl, once she set her goal, demonstrated her ferocity by persistently demanding it. She killed the doctor’s family, but even then, he fled instead of seeking revenge.

“Why won’t you hate me?”
“Why won’t you look at me?”

Chasing the fleeing doctor to Antarctica, the girl despaired in front of the doctor, who chose death out of fear and rejection, realizing she could never become human. Therefore, she entrusted her wish to the Holy Grail.

That wish being to bring her a companion who would make her human. It will take a bit more time for the girl to realize that this is the encounter with her Master.

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

Whether it’s the power of Mahatma, Samba, or something else entirely, Santa Claus Fran-chan has emerged. The girl, now known as Presentstein instead of Frankenstein, scatters presents indiscriminately in her excitement.

……Basically, like the swimsuit version of Fran, she deliberately seals away her serious background and history.

What matters is enjoying the present, and by doing so, she believes she is repaying whoever made her Santa Claus and the Master who acknowledges her.

Like her original self, she loves flowers and scatters them along with the presents.
