### Magical Resistance: E

Nullifies low ranking magecraft spells.

### Independent Action: A

Gilgamesh possesses a high-ranked Independent Action Skill. But in the case of using a large amount of magical energy, backup from his Master becomes necessary.

### Divinity: B (A+)

Gilgamesh originally had his Divinity at his maximum rank of A+, but the rank has been lowered because said person does not have a favourable impression of the gods.
