He is fundamentally Kid Gil from hollow. There was even a plan for the size of the armour in Gil-kun’s Third Stage Ascension where it matches with the dimensions of his body, but then it appears as if this is much more better for the small child impression, right? Thus, the armour and cloth that are of the same size as the adult Gilgamesh’s are floating by his hips with a mysterious power. There is the impression that when he walks normally in Chaldea, it looks like he is slowly dragging his mantle along. (Tenkuu Sphere)
