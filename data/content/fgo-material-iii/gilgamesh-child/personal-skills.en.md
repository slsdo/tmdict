### Beautiful Rosy-Cheeked Boy: C

One’s nature as a pretty boy that attracts people. It works as a magical charm effect towards people, regardless of their gender, but evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.

### Golden Rule: A

Indicates the fortune of how much money flowed around oneself in their life.

Gilgamesh, who is considered to be someone who has infinite wealth in the Golden Capital, will never be troubled with money throughout his whole life and can live as an extremely rich person.

### Charisma: A+

Gilgamesh, who is said to be the most outstanding king, possesses an extremely high charisma – as if it is even a charm or a curse – already since the time of his youth.

### Collector: EX

The talent to obtain items of a superior quality.

It is the good luck to incessantly procure even rare items, but it must be remembered that it is a Skill Gilgamesh possesses, so there is no benefit for his Master.
