### Gate of Babylon: Treasures of the King

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>B+</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Range</td><td>–</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>–</td></tr>

A keyblade that is linked to the Golden Capital. It connects to the capital’s dimensional space, with which Gilgamesh will be freely able to take out the tools that are within his treasure house. It goes without saying that the more of the user’s treasures there are, the more powerful this Noble Phantasm becomes. By connecting the space near himself to Babylon with this Noble Phantasm, Gilgamesh can shoot out innumerable “Originals” of Noble Phantasms that come in a variety of forms, such as swords and spears.

Although the quantity of the contents that can be shot out is lower in comparison to what Gilgamesh in his normal state would have, from the way it seems, Kid Gil is choosing the Noble Phantasms that are to be shot out with the aim of observing his opponents properly in order to “strike at their weak points.”

### Enkidu: The Chains of Heaven

A Noble Phantasm crowned with the name of Gilgamesh’s one and only friend. One of the Noble Phantasms utilized through “Treasures of the King”. Countless chains will bind the opponent in a moment upon activation. It causes a Paralysis status effect and sustained damage onto the opponent by means of binding. It is an Anti-Divine armament that was utilized in the legends – at the time of when the “Bull of Heaven” Divine Beast was being suppressed, thus the higher the target’s divinity aptitude, the more its power grows.

### Sha Naqba Imuru: The Omniscient and Omnipotent Star

Sha Naqba Imuru (He who Saw the Abyss). Hero King Gilgamesh’s mentality, which reaches every corner of the world like the radiance of the stars and sees through all of creation, sublimated into a Noble Phantasm. A Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type. Not to mention an opponent’s True Name and Noble Phantasm(s), it can definitely see even a truth hidden underneath multiple layers without obstruction and with a single glance. Although it is in a state where it seems to be constantly invoked, one can also assume from appearances that some parts of the Noble Phantasm’s ability are being intentionally limited.

If its True Name is released, it will operate as “instructions” for Gilgamesh to guide himself and others with the most optimum tactics according to the situation presented to him, simultaneously increasing the offensive power and defensive power of his whole team near his own position.
