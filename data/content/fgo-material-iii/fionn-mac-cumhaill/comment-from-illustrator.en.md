The image of his face was settled in almost one shot, but I was greatly troubled about his costume. I regret that I should have raised his tights even more for the times when the Celts all come to appear together in the distant future. Even though a perfect ikemen-like characteristic was specified for him, there were many more cheerful lines implemented for him than what I had thought, so I should have made his facial expressions more amusing, yeah?â€¦ Well, to be honest, this uncle is about the same age as me? And he is madly in love with his Showa sense brimming over. (Moriyama Daisuke)
