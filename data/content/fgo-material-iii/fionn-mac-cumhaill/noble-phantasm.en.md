### Mac an Luin: The Undefeated Violet Healing Flower

<table>

A magical spear that is considered to be the spear that killed Aillen, a Divine Spirit that has fallen to the state of an evil fairy. A two-handed spear that is more than 2 meters in length.

In addition to being endowed with an auto-attack function, the spear can nullify all negative effects that influence the mind. If the True Name is released, it fires a single attack that is accompanied by a violently rushing stream of “water” that the War God Nuada, his ancestor, administers.

Its True Name comes from an inscription about the beloved sword of Fionn mac Cumhaill. That sword is often viewed in the same light as his spear, and it was assimilated with that spear that slew the Divine Spirit Aillen at the time of being established as a Noble Phantasm.

Water scooped by Fionn’s hands will entirely gain the power of healing————the anecdote itself of his Water of Life that became a Noble Phantasm. No matter if it is the water of a fountain, spring water, or tap water, “if scooped with both hands”, it will immediately become water that has a recovery effect. If used on humans, their wounds will be healed, and it also works the same on Heroic Spirits. Poisons will also be cleansed from this water. Fionn usually takes in the water he scooped into a water bag he carries with him so he can readily use it when necessary.

### Fintan Finegas: Biting the Thumb Swelling with Wisdom

Perhaps there seems to be another proper True Name for this Noble Phantasm (however, the subtitle is the same).

The anecdote of the Salmon of Knowledge which granted wisdom to Fionn that became a Noble Phantasm. Because that salmon’s fat remains imprinted on one of Fionn’s thumb, if that thumb is licked, it is said that one will immediately acquire great wisdom. It is also the origin of the “Uisce Beatha: O’ Lives Scooped with These Hands” Noble Phantasm as that is viewed as something based on this Noble Phantasm’s very anecdote.

Incidentally, salmon’s fat contains mostly DHA which boosts one’s powers of concentration.
