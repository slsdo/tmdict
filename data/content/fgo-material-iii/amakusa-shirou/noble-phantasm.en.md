His own two hands that had become Noble Phantasms. By these two hands, he had caused miracles to occur again and again, bringing hope to those faithfuls who walked a path of hardships. Able to connect to any magecraft foundation, they form a ‘skeleton key’ allowing him to wield any form of magecraft.

At the same time, his right and left arms can exercise abilities similar to the Mind’s Eye (True) and Mind’s Eye (False) skills respectively, and strengthen his Baptismal Rites.
