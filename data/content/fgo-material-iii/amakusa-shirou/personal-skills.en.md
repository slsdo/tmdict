### Revelation: A

A skill equivalent to Instinct. Whereas Instinct is a ‘sixth sense’ for combat, Revelation applies to all matters related to the attainment of a goal; the choosing of the best path during a journey, for example. However, as these choices are not based on anything concrete (that he is aware of) he cannot explain them to others very well.

### True Name Discernment: B

By being summoned as a Ruler, all Servants that he meets directly will have their true names and parameters automatically revealed. However, a LCK check is necessary against Servants with concealment abilities.

### Divine Judgment: C

The authority exclusive to Rulers to exercise Command Spells against other Servants.

### Charisma: C-

The inborn talent to command a military force. Although he cannot govern a nation, he can form powerful bonds with comrades with whom he share the same aims, and they are willing to lay their lives down for them. Due to this skill, he is also able to have his comrades believe in the contents of his Revelations.

### Baptismal Rite: B+

Magecraft formulated in the style of the Church that is tremendously effective against spiritual bodies. Combined with his two Noble Phantasms, he can sublimate even Servants.
