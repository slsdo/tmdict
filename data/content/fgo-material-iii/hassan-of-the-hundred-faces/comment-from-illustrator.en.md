The fascinatingly charming and strongly active Hassako and her friends (they’re one person actually). When I asked 『Doesn’t she have no face?』, I received 『That’s, well, romance』as an answer, so I aimed for a Middle Eastern beauty with sharp eyes and full lips.
Abs, abs! I like how her standing pose gives a somewhat unusual feeling. The biggest trouble was accepting to draw a lot of Hassans in the background, but there isn’t much to see〜 (Task Ohna)
