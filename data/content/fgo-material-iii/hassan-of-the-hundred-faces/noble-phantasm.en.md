Zabaniya.
A Noble Phantasm ability originated from the multiple personalities had during life. A division of the spiritual potential is performed along with the division of the multiple personalities, and makes possible to act as different individuals (up to 80 bodies + there’s the possibility of the appearance of an unconscious ego).
Since the bodies exist responding to each personality, the appearances vary from elders to youngsters, men and women, giant builds and small statures, but it seems the race is fixed.
Confirmed names are Zayd the Base, Makul the Quick, Gozul the Remarkable.
Since they split themselves, the total power remains the same no matter how much the number of individuals increases.
Therefore, the more they divide the lower the ability of the individuals, but only the characteristic skill of the class of the assassin 『Presence Concealment』 doesn’t decline, and by making maximum use of this, they become an extremely excellent intelligence organization.
Each of the divided individuals is respectively established as a different entity.
If one of the divided individuals dies, that individual doesn’t return to the entirety of Assassin, but it becomes eliminated. There isn’t a superior that can be called 『real form』, so it’s not like they’re birthing inferior 『offshoots』, all Assassins are existences with the same rank.
Also, it’s not like they’re connected by something like telepathy, so if they don’t communicate by any means like conversation, they can’t share the information they have.
