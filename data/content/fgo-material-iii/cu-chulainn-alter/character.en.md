### Personality

Cú Chulainn, who has become a king of massacre.
He has acquired a ferociousness and nature like those of a beast, but the vigor of his life force isn’t something to 「survive」, but to 「lead to death」.
What is the wish of a beast? It’s not survival. It’s dashing. Beasts eat meat to survive and not to scamper. That’s why this Cú Chulainn discards even the desire to “eat” as useless.
Just fast. Just far. Just meaninglessly. As if believing that the place where he will fall after using up all his strength is his goal.

He will murder the enemy whether it’s a good person, a Heroic Spirit, or a friend.
He doesn’t think fighting is fun. If it’s standing as an enemy, he won’t hesitate even if he’s facing Scáthach.
If an ally repeats a mistake, there won’t be mercy.
The lack of pangs of the one who stands at the top of the soldiers of the warrior race, the Celts, would make anyone shake.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The attitude towards the Master is complete indifference.
Since he thinks of himself as a battle machine and as a blade, he won’t oppose any unreasonable order if he thinks it’s not impossible.
However, he won’t respond to any order that has to do with doing something other than battle related things at all.
He has the strong will to think he’s just a being that kills the enemies, and not to be concerned in anything besides that.

### Dialogue Examples

『I’m an unimportant warrior of Ulster.
Since I’ve been summoned as a Servant, I’ll do what I gotta do』

『Don’t take the personality of Servants much into account. We’re weapons after all.
They too, I too, will turn into enemies at any moment if it’s necessary』

『All curses released. No moderation, challenge despair…… Curruid Coinchenn!』

### Historical Image · Character Image

The brave hero of the Celtic Ulster cycle.
A member of the Order of the Red Branch as well as Ulster’s strongest warrior, he won fame by freely using the invincible demonic spearmanship received from the leader of the spirit world 「The Land of Shadows」, Scáthach.
Manifesting as a Berserker, the equipment of his whole body turns black, and his personality changes too. His facial expression is ruthless, his Noble Phantasm demonic spear becomes red mixed with black, and he projects a sinister presence.

A Servant reflecting Queen Medb’s wish for 「Cú Chulainn to be an evil king similar to me」. He abandoned the cheerfulness of Cú Chulainn, and exposed his side as a battle machine.

That the Celtic soldiers opposed in the fifth chapter were merciless was not only by Medb’s power, but also because they were led by Cú Chulainn’s cruelty.
He continues fighting not out of joy as a warrior, but only in order to prove that he’s the 「king」.
Many Servants have accused his way of being of 「foolish」, but that’s natural. The 「kings」 that Cú Chulainn saw were, without exception, foolish.
That said, his thirst for victory is by far stronger than that of the normal Cú Chulainn. That’s because winning is an obvious duty.
Logical cogitation and speech are possible, but since all of them are vectorially directed to 「winning battles」, a conversation with the opponents can’t fundamentally be established. Because of that, he has no mercy and begging for one’s life has no effect.

He can throw Gáe Bolg with its throwing version, but the power is higher than that of the usual Gáe Bolg.
As a compensation, his right arm will be damaged to the point of being torn off each time he activates it, but that’s compensated by regenerating and recovering it with Rune magecraft.
Only the sharp pain, enough to make an ordinary person go crazy, can’t be prevented, but Cú Chulainn eludes it by simply enduring it.

### Connections with Characters

#### Medb

She gave birth to Cú Chulainn (Alter). The queen that kept directing her impossibly distorted, as well as ardent, affection to him.

#### Scáthach

The largest wall. Crush her, overcome her, trample her. Don’t long to battle, aspire to win. Simply just feed the emptiness gained after winning to the dogs.

#### Cú Chulainn

My positive side. ……Ain’t he too bright? Is this for real?
