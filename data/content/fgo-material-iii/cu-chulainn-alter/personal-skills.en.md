### Battle Continuation: A

Doesn’t know when to give up to the bitter end. The tenacity of a beast.
The ability to continue fighting. Can survive as long as he doesn’t receive a decisive fatal wound, and it’s possible to fight even if he receives wounds that leave him on the verge of death.

### Madness of the Elementals{{n1}}: A

The bellow of Cú Chulainn awakens the Elementals sleeping in the earth and crushes the mentality of the soldiers from the enemy army. A mental interference.
Temporarily ranks down the Strength and Agility parameters of all members of the enemy front.

### Rune Magecraft: B

Possession of Scandinavian Magic Crests, Runes.
At the time of manifestation in this state, Cú Chulainn automatically activates the magecraft equivalent to the 「Magic Resistance」 skill.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)

### Protection against Arrows: C

A defensive effect against projectile weapons.
Evades projectiles seen with the eyes that aren’t caused by magecraft.
Since he’s maddened, it suffers a drastic rank-down from usual.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} 精霊 is “spirit”, but it’s used to refer to Elementals in the Nasuverse, so I changed the translation to make it more fitting.
