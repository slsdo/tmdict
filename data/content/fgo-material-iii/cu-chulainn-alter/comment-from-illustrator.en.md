I got a designation to do a distorted king Cú Chulainn, but Cú Chulainn has the image of a warrior in my head, so I went through Hell working to fill the image gap. The number of rejected drafts is overwhelmingly larger compared to other characters, and in the end I put all the parts together and made him thorny with tail, cape, and tattoos, but it caused a lot of trouble with the consistency in the three views. Since what he’s wearing is the skeleton of Curruid, same as his spear, as armor, I introduced marine life designs on the whole. (Shimadrill)
