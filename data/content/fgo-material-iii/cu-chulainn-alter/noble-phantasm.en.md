### Gáe Bolg: Spear of Gouging and Piercing Massacre

Gáe Bolg.
A homing demonic spear missile. Almost the same Noble Phantasm as when usually summoned.
By throwing his automatic tracking demonic lance, he sweeps up the enemies within range. Since it’s a full-power throw to the degree of being willing to collapse his own body, its power and effective range have risen when compared to his usual summoning. It has an instant death effect against the entire enemy front, and deals great damage in the case of not dying instantly.
Since he’s throwing 「while regenerating the collapsing body」through Rune magecraft, Cú Chulainn doesn’t receive damage, but can’t prevent the sharp pain.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)

Curruid Coinchenn.
The rage of the rampaging Cú Chulainn temporarily embodies the skeleton of the monster of the Red Sea who became the origin of the demonic spear Gáe Bolg, the marine beast Curruid, and clads his body in it as an armor. An offensive-type bone armor. Wearing it ranks-up his Endurance, and his Strength parameter becomes EX.
『Soaring spear that strikes with death』 can’t be used while activating this Noble Phantasm.
