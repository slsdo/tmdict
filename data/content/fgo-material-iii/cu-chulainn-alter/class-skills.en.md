### Mad Enhancement: EX (equivalent to C)

Since he’s a Berserker class born from a wish to the Grail, while it equals to C rank, it’s possible to have a logical conversation.
However, since any use of sophistry has no effect, and decisions other than heading towards the target and pushing forwards won’t happen, it can be said that a conversation with the opponent is substantially impossible.

### Divinity: C

Aptitude to be a Divine Spirit.
Cú Chulainn, who is the child of the Sun god Lugh, is endowed with high aptitude to become a Divine Spirit.
Since he’s been Altered, his Divinity is a rank down from usual.
