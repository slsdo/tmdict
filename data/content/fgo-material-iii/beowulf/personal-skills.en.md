### Berserk: A

A composite Skill of the Valour Skill and Madness Enhancement Skill, negating mental interference such as intimidation, confusion and fascination, and increasing melee damage. Simultaneously, when using this Skill, he turns into a beast that fights with his instincts.

### Intuition: B

The ability to always “feel” the most suitable development for oneself during combat.

By being summoned as a Berserker, he may slightly disregard his intuitions.

### Battle Continuation: B

One does not know when to give up even to the very end.

In particular, even after entering old age, he still had the guts to go strong, and he did not stop breathing until he killed a fire dragon.
