I was given an impression of something like Fight Club, so since it was that, I decided on a man that seems very simple and tough. Although, there is no significance to him getting darker as it was for the sake of showing the incremental differences between his stagesâ€¦ He is restrained to a degree with handcuffs, and given it was established that he is at his strongest with his bare hands, the weapons are more like extras? The image of Hrunting is like that of a sword that absorbs blood and becomes red and strong, while Naegling is like a nuclear explosion the moment it breaks. Although they are unused as Noble Phantasms since he is at his strongest when bare-handed, right? (haha) (Shimokoshi)
