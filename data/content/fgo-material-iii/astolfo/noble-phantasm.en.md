Hippogriff.
With the upper body of a griffin and the lower body of a horse, it is essentially an impossible existence of a Phantasmal Beast. Although its rank is lower compared to griffin, a beast from the age of the gods, its charging pulverization attack is equal to an A rank physical attack.

However, this Phantasmal Horse’s true value lays somewhere else.
Drawing its origin as a halfling born from a griffin and a horse, its existence is extremely vague; and so it is able to put itself in the gap between dimensions, moving while permeating any and all sorts of attack.

La Black Luna.
A hunting horn that emits a magical note reminiscent to the neigh of a sacred horse and the howl of a dragon. Those within its range would be struck with the shock of an explosive sound. In the case where the damage is the same or higher than the target HP, they will be turned to to dust and scattered around. It was given to Astolfo by the witch of beauty, Logistilla, and was used to drive away a flock of harpies. Normally it is reduced to a smaller size and hung on the hip, but upon usage it becomes big enough to even encircle Astolfo.
In FateGO it is fundamentally not utilized.

Inherited from a certain witch, it is a book with the means to shatter any and all magic recorded within it. Just by possessing it makes it possible to automatically cancel magic A rank and below.
It does not cancel a Reality Marble or a high-thaumaturgy exceedingly close to Reality Marbles to such an extent, but evoking its true name and reading its content makes it a possibility.
…But Astolfo has completely forgotten the true name of this book. Even Universal Magic Guide is just a noncomittal name.
The true name of this Noble Phantasm is “Destruction Declaration”-----Casseur de Logistille.
(In FateGO it is fundamentally not utilized.)
