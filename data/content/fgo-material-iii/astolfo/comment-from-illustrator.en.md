Since this guy here reaaally just moves on his own, it was quite easy to come up with stuffs like his expression or direction of the design. Still, because progress-wise in Apocrypha version I had to plan him completely and thoroughly, I do remember some hardships. Eventually I did manage to apply some good concepts and ideas eventually, so I was able to enjoy it. Design wise, the area around his lower hip is wider compared to his relatively thinner back, then the shoulder deliberately becomes wider again; full of the cute, bewitching techniques that makes you unaware of his natural shoulder width.
