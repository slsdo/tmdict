### Evaporation of Reason: D

The loss of reason. Astolfo is incapable of keeping any and all secrets.
Astolfo would blurt out allies’ true name and weakpoint and forget important secrets; at this point, it’s already a type of curse.
This Skill also includes the effect of Instinct Skill, making it possible to grasp the most optimum course of action during combat.

### Monstrous Strength: C-

Temporarily magnifies STR. However, during the usage of this Skill, Astolfo receives damage every turn.

### Down with a Touch!: D

Trap of Argalia. Normally a Noble Phantasm. The jousting lance of the Knight Argalia. It possesses a golden spearhead.
Although its capacity to wound is low, simply wounding the enemy would dematerialise their feet, turning it possible to make them fall down.
To return themself from this fallen down state, a LCK check is necessary. Should it fail, the “fallen down” bad status would persist.
However, each turn there is a LCK upwards adjustment, making the success rate easier.
