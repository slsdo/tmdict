### Personality

(*doesnt really think about stuffs)

Just like a bright ads board{{n1}}, no matter where Astolfo goes, Astolfo is always thoughtlessly optimistic.
So much that Astolfo would carry up and help a homunculus who had managed to wish for help without any particular reason.
For Astolfo, if it is “a deed that gives me a good feeling”, then there’s no problem whatsoever with it.
Astolfo would act as Astolfo wishes depending on an on the spot judgement, but his high luck is not just for show; most of the time, what Astolfo does end up go smoothly.
(Though there is that one accident where Astolfo got turned into a tree.)

Combined with an evaporating reason, it is not like there is no possibility for one to become liable to depravity--that is, to evil. However, to begin with the program of “doing bad things” basically has been omitted already from Astolfo’s head, so it’s all good.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Astolfo does not really have any wish towards the Holy Grail.
Astolfo simply and gladly helps anyone who seek to borrow Astolfo’s strength.
However, in the case that the Master is recklessly evil, it would be impossible to make Astolfo to do the worst sort of harm. That is due the hidden Noble Phantasm “Destruction Declaration”; even the binding of Command Spells only has dull effect on Astolfo.

Should the Master be a virtuous one, Astolfo would earnestly embrace the Master, devoted to the point that Astolfo would wage Astolfo’s own life quite easily. However, due to Astolfo’s reason evaporating, there would be many times when Astolfo ends up making outrageous, careless mistakes as well.

### Dialogue Examples

“Astolfo of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne! Hereby dance as I fall{{n2}}! Ah, although I don’t actually fall!”
“Mm, perfect! Well, I’m tired for now, so I’m taking a break. Bye bye!”
“Alright, Master! I am your sword, your blade, your arrow! Since you really go out and trust someone weak like me, I’m gonna answer you with the best I got!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The mood maker of the legend of Charlemagne.
Astolfo’s strength is inferior to that of the famed Roland or Oliver, but being a noble knight with bottomless brightness, Astolfo had managed to overcome one uphill task after another.

In the process, Astolfo had obtained many things, from “the golden spear that would topple down anybody” that a man named Argalia had used and “a grimoire that shatters and and all sorts of magic” to even “the Phantasmal Beast hippogriff born from a horse and a griffin”, applying them in various adventures.

…Astolfo, who had managed to obtain plenty of magic items, is at the same time also someone who does not really get attached to things. For example, Astolfo had once loaned the spear to the female knight Bradamante, and had readily set free the hippogriff during the journey to the moon.

Perhaps it is due to that personality that is void of greed that Astolfo managed to collect a numerous amount of Noble Phantasm. It is no different now that Astolfo is a Servant; apart from the hippogriff who isn’t really going anywhere else, Astolfo would give away most of the Noble Phantasm should there be someone in need for it.

It is said that Astolfo’s “reason” resides in the moon--or perhaps a different world that resembles the moon. Due to that, there is a case where Astolfo would regain Astolfo’s innate wit during the new moon.

Astolfo had also participated in the fight against the infamous battle of Roncevaux as one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne, and died in the process. Astolfo does not regret any of it… but of course, with the exception of the death of Astolfo’s comrade.

To begin with, having a way of life that do not have anything to do with regret or remorse is how Astolfo is.
The fool set off on a trip, gaining various things in the course of it--and then discarded them all, dancing and singing as a fool would cheerfully.
