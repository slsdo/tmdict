Given that Medb’s design concept needed the impression that her clothing is going to be undressed in succession rather than saying that they’re being changed, it resulted in the concept of Medb’s transformation being seen as a small amount of clothes being worn underneath her outer layers.

Stage 1: It’s a snugly specification that won’t let her catch a cold even if Cu-chan stands up his Christmas date with her. When drawing a derived work, this is the recommended stage to be drawn since it’s the most comfortable for one to draw, right? Also, because I’m pleased with this one the most, I personally keep her battle sprite in this state.

Stage 2: Because I received the specification called a white female knight, this stage was imagined first. The other stages were created by adding and subtracting from here.

Stage 3: Although I imagined sexy underwear, she’s somewhat like a powerful princess, no, a “reigning champion of the ring”, isn’t she? I certainly want her to start up something like a New Celtic Pro Wrestling promotion! Entering gaudily while being accompanied by an assistant wearing a bull costume!

Hey, with that sort of feeling, I’d like to see Medb’s actions in FGO, no matter how surprising they are! (Takayama Kisai)
