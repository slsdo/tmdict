### Chariot My Love: My Dear Iron Chariot

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>B</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Range</td><td>2~40</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>50 people</td></tr>

She mounts the “chariot” that embodies her own powerful influence and performs a charging attack. An area of effect attack. It is a two-unit chariot that uses the bulls associated with the “Táin Bó Cúailnge”, and this chariot represents the lord’s royal authority that rules over the people, the steel that oppresses the people, and the fear that makes the people tremble. It is particularly effective against males. It is difficult for any man to brush aside the approaching Medb. In “Fate/Grand Order”, it has been readjusted (retuned) from being an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm into an Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm.

No man caught in Medb’s chariot can escape it, no matter what. Her chariot room has already changed into a Reality Marble by then, a love nest that will not set them free until the deed is finished.

Brings a torrent of golden mead infused with her legend of charm, presenting it while showing a smile and saying, “Please.” When they are being hostile, somehow, men will take that alcohol. If one gulps it down his mouth, by then, it is even the same as a man who became her property.

Temporarily borrows the ability of future vision possessed by Ulster King Conchobar, who was her husband for a period of time.

  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Anti-Army Noble Phantasm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Range</td><td>20~40</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>300 people</td></tr>
</table>

Temporarily summons the magic sword Caladbolg, the Noble Phantasm of her lover Fergus, and with a lovely swing while saying, “Take thattt”, she releases a rainbow shimmering from the sword. An area of effect attack of the Great Spin in the Sky of Heaven and Earth.
