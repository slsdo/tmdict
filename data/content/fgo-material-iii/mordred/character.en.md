### Personality

Having been trained as a knight, she is relatively prepared in terms of manners and etiquette; however, as a manner of fact her doctrine is that of violence supremacy. With her being quite recklessly rebellious against those with influence, at her core she is truly one at a rebellious age.
She does not tolerate being treated as a woman, but acknowledging being perfectly treated as a man in itself is also quite… her personality is truly difficult.
To add, during battle she shows a truly superior competence, and due to her doctrine of “might makes right”{{n1}} she would peruse deliberately of even unfair tactics.
However, perhaps it is due to her pride as a knight, she would never make use of plans that involve those unrelated.
The type who enjoys the real world. She would still have some meals even if she is given magic energy supply.
Quoted from the person herself: “Because I’m different from my father, who’s all stiff and formal!”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She basically deals with the Master as someone equal. She tends to avoid magi’s typically tricky and wily nature. If one wishes to get along with her, perhaps one must be a Master who never treat her like a woman or a child, who associate with her in an honest and frank way, and whose wish is earnest even if not grandiose.

### Dialogue Examples

“Go ahead and run away. I don’t blame you; after all, you’re fighting me, Mordred!”
“Hah, just chalk it up to bad luck and give up!”
“I entrust you my sword; my honor; my life. I may only be a third-rate of a knight; still you are fine with that?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The splendour legend of King Arthur.
Its glory gradually waned from the conflict between the knights, the invasion of the savage tribes, as well as various famines and droughts. And it was her who had been given the role to close the legend’s curtain----the knight of rebellion, Mordred.

Her father is King Arthur, her mother the enchantress Morgan.
A homunculus born by magic and the machinations of Morgan.
For a while, she had been raised by Morgan, who whispered unto her for revenge against King Arthur.
“This country belongs to you. ----------One day, you will be the king.”
However, Mordred did not hate the king; she instead thought of the world of him.
Her feeling of indebt of being not human disappears; only her pride of having the same blood as the king was carved within her.
Mordred dreamt. Of whether or not the king would approve of her as his successor. But she was mistaken; the knight king is the purest of king, and his rule has no hesitation.
Seeing that Mordred was unfit to be a king, as far as the king was concerned she could not be his successor.
However, Mordred took it amiss. She thought that the knight king detested her for being the child of Morgan.

….From the beginning, all of King Arthur’s desperate endeavour amounted to nothing but an attempt to prolong the life of Britain. One day, all of it would fall------for the end of the age of the gods had announce itself already.

However, Mordred brought what should have been a slow waning into a desperate destruction.
The knight king swung the holy spear, bringing down the finishing blow. At that moment, the knight of rebellion finally realized it.

--------Ahh. No, it’s not that this king is not seeing me.
--------From the beginning, he’s unable to see anyone.

She then remembers the words once uttered by a knight as he left Camelot.
"The king understands not of human heart."
Her hatred, her admiration; all of it was pushed away-------she believed those words to be true.

Without realizing one other thing of great matter.
Of what the knight king wished for. Of what the knight king lived for.
Of what the knight king wanted to see instead of what she herself wanted to see.
In this piece, the answer to that question does not exist.

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria

Needless to be said, her father. Mordred harbors hatred, love, and many other emotions towards her, all of them mix and jumbled within her; it is impossible to explain in just a word. Does she wish to exceed her? Does she wish to stand with her? Does she wish to go ahead of her? Does she wish to trample her? Not even Mordred herself understand.

#### Artoria Lily

“A younger father!?” (What’s with that logic error){{n2}}

#### Lancelot

“Ah, here’s the infidel bastard. Yo there, philanderer! Go hang yourself! Get stoned! Get Shakespeare to write a provocative article about you!“{{n3}}

#### Gawain

“The honor student. He looks like a good-looking dog no matter how you look at him. It’s kinda irritating. If Gareth hadn’t been there I would have picked a fight with him already. Also, this has been on my mind a lot, but being invincible until sunset… that’s pretty freaking unfair, isn’t it?”

#### Frankenstein

Due to a circumstances where Mordred can’t really treat her as a stranger’s problem, she’s kinda taking care of her. At any rate, if Mordred just left her alone she’s just going to get all languid at the corner of the room.

#### Agravain

Birds of a feather{{n4}}. That being said, they don’t actually have much of a common ground, so they are not particularly close. But for some reason she felt like he had always been taking care of her, so he’s a good guy. Maybe.
