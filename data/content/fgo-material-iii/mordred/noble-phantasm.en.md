Clarent.
This sword was kept within King Arthur’s armory, the sword that represents the throne’s succession.
Said to be “more dazzling than any silver”, it is a treasured sword which worth is no less or even more than the “Golden Sword of the Victorious”, but Mordred had stolen it without acknowledgement; due to that, its rank is lower than how it originally was.
(In FGO, it is fundamentally not being utilized)

Clarent Blood Arthur.
The fullpower release of the Radiant Sword of the King. Normally a splendid sword shining in silver, upon invocation it is dyed with crimson blood and turn itself into an unsightly shape.
A demonic sword which shoots out the raging hatred coiling around its edge.
