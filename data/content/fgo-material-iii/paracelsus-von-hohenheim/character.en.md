### Personality

A scholarly mage who is intellectual and calm. Paracelsus’ temperament is mild and he does not like combat. Regarding young companions, he has joy in teaching and guiding them without his cool, calm and collected attitude being disturbed, even frequently expressing this joy by showing a smile on his mouth.

Unusual for a mage, Paracelsus advocates that human affection is a precious quality. He regards all modern mages far and wide as the descendants of his pupils that inherited his teachings, receiving them with open affection as if they are like his children. He greatly believes that these men and women have infinite potential and are surely the future, and that the accumulation of their potential will even allow them to eventually arrive at the Root, the Truth of the World. If it is from the perspective of the common mage who honours the mages’ bloodline of individuals and family lineages, his words are close to the state of madness, but he does not intend to bend his beliefs. He is naturally a mad scientist.

There is absolutely no variation in Paracelsus’ interactions between men and women.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Paracelsus quietly swears allegiance towards his Master. Or rather, it is more accurate to say that he swears friendship. In a situation like in a conventional Holy Grail War where a mage is his Master, he will build an equal relationship as a comrade who aims to reach the Root together with his Master. In the case where his Master does not study magecraft, he will propose to be their “friend”.

The wish Paracelsus wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to reach the Root.” Speaking of that furthermore, he surely wishes to ascertain his personal opinion that the Ether that consists of the Truth, which once filled this world, and the light of the planet (like that of the Holy Sword for instance), were probably the lights shining out of the Root―——―or, so it was. It may not come to light that he, as of the present time, is seeking atonement instead.

### Dialogue Examples

“Please, become friends with me.”
“All my dear children who fill this earth, you are the brilliance of the precious stars.”
“The Ether’s finality, I think it will lead to the ritual of the Age of Gods that was lost. I want in my hands… the radiance of the righteous stars that the sages of Chaldea attained far off in the ancient times. That is to say, it is the ultimate light, which the universe was full of, that twinkles fully, and simultaneously, it also seems to be the light of this planet.”
“… The light of the planet emitted from your sword. It is very, very beautiful.”
“Please try to pay attention… to the kind of magecraft an Average One is capable of.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A legendary physician and alchemist. In the 16th Century, Paracelsus is known as a historic figure who played an active role in the Renaissance period. Spanning over the course of his lifetime, he devoted himself to the studies of medicine and alchemy, having left behind many achievements and books such as the “Rediscovery of the Four (Five) Elements” and the “Rediscovery of the Three Primes”.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A rare figure who left his name in both human and magic history. A powerful mage (Average One) who is endowed with the attribute of “Void” in addition to the four attributes of “Earth”, “Water”, “Fire” and “Wind”, studied Gem Magecraft, and was also considered to have deeply influenced the development of alchemy as a Magical Foundation. In the significance of the Magical Foundation of what mages far and wide was taught as alchemy in the modern era, there is a likelihood that this one man is the pioneer that deeply engraved alchemy into this world. Although Paracelsus was a person who was close with the Clock Tower, it is said that he exceptionally conducted networking with both the Atlas Academy and the Wandering Sea, having advanced their mutual researches.

However, as one can further understand from the matter of his name being visibly left behind in history, Paracelsus has a tendency to “spread to people” the secrets of Mysteries that should have essentially been concealed, having continued to publish towards the general public a fragment of his magical research as theories while ignoring the inhibitions of the Clock Tower and the warnings extended to him from that association again and again, and in his final moments, he lost his life to enforcement figures from the Mage’s Association as he was in the process of increasing the production of his Philosopher’s Stones and distributing these mass-produced items. During the occasion of assassins having arrived at his mansion, it is said that he showed absolutely no panic in his bearing, having greeted them while smiling.

A rare mage who surely loves children and values humanity. That is indeed Paracelsus von Hohenheim――――However. The possibility of him suddenly abandoning his entire creed and falling into injustice is also by no means zero. For example, what if there is something like a situation where he came across someone connected to the Root itself that he is aiming for?

### Color Correspondence of the Five Elements

Earth (Yellow), Water (Silver), Fire (Red), Wind (Blue), Ether (A deep Purple close to Black).

At the time when the colours were established for the Five Elements in western magecraft, the basis of the colour scheme is the same as the assignments based on India’s Tattva.

### General Armaments

He can perform long distance attacks by means of magecraft. He performs magical attacks by employing the Five Great Elements. When using magecraft, an object similar to a large gemstone (Elemental) that corresponds to the element being used floats around Paracelsus’ surroundings.

### Connections with Characters

#### Artoria (Saber) / Arthur (Proto)

Concerning those who possess Excalibur that is filled with the light of the planet, it is very much a subject of research, and simultaneously for himself, Paracelsus shows an obsession towards it as an objective that he must overtake.

#### Siegfried

If Paracelsus becomes acquainted with the one who owns Balmung, the sword with True Ether itself hidden within it, then he will very much— (omitted)

#### Makiri Zolgen

An acquaintance during his lifetime. A mage who possessed noble thoughts, and although their research contents differ, Paracelsus wanted to become friends with him. Since he is aware of Makiri as an idealist who should be a noble and respectable person, even if he saw Makiri at the time of the 21st Century, it does not appear likely that Paracelsus will regard him as the very same person.

#### Leonardo da Vinci

As a matter of fact, another acquaintance during his lifetime. Paracelsus deeply respects da Vinci, who has been literally omnipotent even in regards to magecraft. Paracelsus wanted to become friends with him, or something like that, but he feels da Vinci is too awe-inspiring to do so. He often does not remember since when da Vinci did become a woman.

“When I met him for the first time… well now, which was it…?”

#### Arash / Henry Jekyll / Hyde

“…… For some reason, it feels like I am about to recall something.”
