The original Azoth Sword. Paracelsus’ magic sword. A Mystic Code that utilizes the Philosopher’s Stone he created during his lifetime. The whole sword blade is composed of Philosopher’s Stones purified to an ultra-high density. Its original effect is to amplify/supplement/strengthen the power of magecraft.

He does not use this sword to attack his target(s) directly, but he instead exercises ritual magecraft instantly with the magical energy charged up within the sword, and by making use of all the Five Elements, a pseudo-composition of True Ether, which was viewed as the magical energy that the world from the Age of Gods was filled with, is stimulated. Although it is a small fragment, the pseudo-True Ether (Fake) that had materialized is converted into a light of destruction that mows down the surroundings.

Moreover, it possesses a true function that differs from its simple destruction ability…{{n1}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} As demonstrated in Fragments, the sword blade that is composed of Philosopher’s Stones has an ability as a quantum computer where it can analyze and respond to the magical properties emitted by his opponent’s ability and then immediately encroach on it, making that his sword’s own ability. It basically steals one’s powers for his own use. In that case, it’s very similar to Da Vinci’s Noble Phantasm or even the Moon Cell’s calculating faculty.
