### Territory Creation: A

Creates a “Workshop” that is an advantageous position to oneself as a mage.

Because he possesses Rank A in this, it is possible to create a “Temple”, which is superior to a “Workshop”.

### Tool Creation: EX

One can produce devices that carry magical energy.

He has many anecdotes as a legendary alchemist, acquiring this Skill at Rank EX. It is possible for him to create a special crystal called the Philosopher’s Stone, artificial spirits that correspond to the Five Elements called Elementals, robots (homunculi) endowed with advanced judgement abilities and a multibody synchronized thinking faculty, and so on. In addition, mass production of gemstones used for Gem Magecraft is possible by utilizing a leyline connected to his territory.
