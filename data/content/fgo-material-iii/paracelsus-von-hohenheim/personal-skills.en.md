### High-Speed Incantation: A

The ability to speak magical incantations at an accelerated speed. He is able to finish Great Magecraft incantations in one step (at the speed of a Single Action).

In addition to this, for his case, he attempts to make his Gem Magecraft (specifically, his Philosopher’s Stones) more efficient by combining them with his High-Speed Incantations.

### Elemental: A+

The ability to employ artificial spirits that correspond to the Five Elements. Paracelsus also names these artificial spirits Elementals, or Elemental Masses more informally. They are literally magical existences created by using crystals of each elemental attribute, in which they are clumped together super densely, as a base. For example, a Fire Elemental Mass is something made from agglomerated flames, and it can manipulate ultra-high heat. If it is an Earth Elemental Mass, it is endowed with an ultra-high mass as well as a hardness equal to adamantine (diamond). (In addition, because the Void/Ether Elemental Mass is something different from “Ether Clumps”, so to speak, one should be careful.) Although it depends on the labour expended in its creation, they can also be manipulated as familiars that are feasible enough to support oneself even in Servant battles to some extent.

### Philosopher’s Stone: A

The technique to manipulate a magical energy accumulation crystal————or a photonic crystal more informally, that was purified by oneself. The rank greatly fluctuates according to the degree of purity that one can attain. Although various effects can be demonstrated depending on the rank, if it is at least Rank A, it is even possible to bring about a pseudo-immortality upon any given target.
