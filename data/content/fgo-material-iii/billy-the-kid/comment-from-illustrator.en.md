Billy’s design was really difficult. I made more than 10 kinds of hairstyle patterns until his design was settled, drew up considerable patterns for his attire as well, and on top of that, consulted with Mr. Takeuchi, and it resulted in his current figure. From his initial setting, there is a statement in the document that said “A positive and friendly character at first, but as his words continue to become more serious, the more apparent his true character becomes”; the image of his final Ascension has been coming to my mind for some reason or another ever since the moment I read this setting, and I reckon his figure was made well. Because it appears his final Ascension illustration has a very favourable reception, having done my best in drawing his pictures was worthwhile. (Shimaudon)
