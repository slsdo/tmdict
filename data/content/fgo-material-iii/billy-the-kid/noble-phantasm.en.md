A counter triple-burst shot by means of a Colt M1877 double-action revolver (nicknamed “Thunderer”), which is said to have been favoured by Billy the Kid. To be precise, it is not that the revolver is the Noble Phantasm, but it is when the entirety of “Billy the Kid’s marksmanship when he holds this revolver” is completely covered that it would then be regarded as a Noble Phantasm, and it is almost the same as a personal Skill as well.

With a Servant’s perception, the flow of time in his surroundings can be slowed down, and by doing so, he completely grasps the situation he is in before he hits a counter shot into his opponent, all before their attack has reached him. Whether it is an Archer’s shot or a Saber’s slash heading towards him, he completely grasps his opponent’s location and their attack before firing a maximum of three shots to penetrate their vital points. By becoming a Servant, the range of his shots has been extended several times further than when he was alive. However, this is understood as a counter only to an “avoidable attack” – attacks he can actually dodge in other words – and it is meaningless against measures that result in an unavoidable attack.

The craftiest aspect of this Noble Phantasm is that it has a low amount of magical energy consumption due to the fact that the Noble Phantasm’s concept is using a large part of “technique” to work. Specifically, it is no more than the same amount of consumption of using a Rank E Noble Phantasm.
