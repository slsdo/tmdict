### Monstrous Strength: B

A Skill that shows its true value in his state as Hyde. It is possible to temporarily rank-up his Strength parameter by one rank.

### Voice of Panic: A

A Skill that shows its true value in his state as Hyde. Performs a mental attack on his targets with a resounding voice that weakens the minds of people who hear it.

### Self-Modification: D

A Skill that shows its true value in his state as Hyde. Remodels his own body into a form specialized for combat. Because he has materialized as an Assassin this time, the rank of this Skill is lowered, and it does not even work very effectively, to the point that it is not certain whether his limbs have grown slightly longer or not. If he were to put this Skill into operation at the time of having materialized as a Berserker, it seems he will change into the form of a mad beast that does not completely appear human, a form suitable for his parameters that were strengthened by his Madness Enhancement Skill.

### Powerless Shell: A

While his mind and body are in the state of Jekyll, the true value of his personal Skills are not shown, his abilities and parameters are lowered as well, and his presence becomes difficult to perceive as a Servant. If it was a normal Holy Grail War, this Skill would function effectively, but… in “Fate/Grand Order”, it is not used very effectively.
