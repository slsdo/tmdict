Karna’s mother Kunti feared becoming an unmarried mother and made a wish to Surya, asking for a golden armor and earring to protect their son.
This is a powerful Defense Noble Phantasm that releases the sun’s radiance.
Since it is light itself taken form, even the gods find it difficult to destroy.
It is unified with Karna’s flesh. (It is sealed in Fate/GO but its armor is visible in his first and second Ascensions)

The Anti-Country Noble Phantasm Karna received from the Brahman Parashurama.
It manifests as bow if his Class is Archer, or a different projectile if his Class is anything else. Adding the effects of Karna’s attribute of intense heat, one hit becomes comparable to a nuclear weapon.
(Its True Name is not released in Fate/GO)

The single-use Spear of Light that can take down even the gods. The spear of mortality, made of lighting.
It manifests in exchange for his armor, replacing tremendous defensive power for a powerful spear with Anti-Divine properties.
