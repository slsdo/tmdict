Having seeing him appear before in CCC and Apocrypha, I was very happy for the chance to draw him myself, too. “A Lancer is not a Lancer if they’re not wearing tights!”, I say even though those are not supposed to be tights. I believe Karna-san is designed as a man who is hot for the modern Japanese standards but wasn’t considered hot when he was alive. Just look at how he has no beard, is thin as a stick and has dead fish eyes. Although those are the elements that make him look so pretty in my drawings. (pako)
