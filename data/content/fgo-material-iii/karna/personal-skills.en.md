### Magic Resistance: C

Negates spells with a chant of two verses or less.
Cannot defend against something more complex, like high magecraft or ritual curses.
However, this statement does not apply for when heâ€™s under the effect of his golden armor Noble Phantasm.

### Riding: A

Can freely control all beasts and vehicles, except those under the Phantasmal Beast/Divine Beast rank.

### Divinity: A

Being the son of the sun god Surya and having unified himself with him after death, Karna has the greatest Divine Spirit Suitability.
This Divine Spirit Suitability works as a powerful defense against sun god Heroic Spirits with a Divinity of B or lower.
