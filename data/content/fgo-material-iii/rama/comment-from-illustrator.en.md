#### Rama

His concept is like the western movie trailer: “The world’s number one for three consecutive years by being an androgynous pretty boy. For you, the finest good-looking guy one can think about right now!“ (There is no such western movie though). Drawing a shy expression, I thought, ‘You’re super cute I tell you!’ In spite of him being a great king, I see that the contents of his character is like a great princess character when I was playing the game, so with that being the case, that does hit a moe point too, don’t you think? (Rin Kususaga)

#### Sita

Hey, this young woman wears just about no clothes on her! Please report her! Still, the concept for Sita is a girl with twintails, but in the beginning, I misunderstood it as ‘Rama transforms and becomes this young woman!’ as the concept (what are you saying!), and because I was misunderstanding, I thought, ‘Changing into those clothes and underwear whenever he transforms… He’s TOTALLY a pervert I tell you…’ I was relieved that he’s very much a different person. I’m thinking, ‘Personally, because of this super satisfying design, I can’t draw any more of these characters for another ten years you know!’… And it’s also something called like… ‘It looks like I stopped continuing my work for the next ten years (shudders).’ (Rin Kususaga)
