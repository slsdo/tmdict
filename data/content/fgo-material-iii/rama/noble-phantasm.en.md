### Brahmastra: The Indestructible which Pierces Through Rakshasas

The “Indestructible Blade” brought alongside himself from the moment he was born for the sake of bringing down Demon King Ravana. It boasts a tremendous power against any demonic being. Originally an arrow, something to be nocked on a bow and shot with, Rama, who wanted to become a Saber, forcibly remodelled it into a sword. However, its ability as a thrown weapon has not been discarded, and this sword can be violently thrown too. One should not point out “So you can throw it after all?”

### Vishnu Baja: Arms of the Great One

The numerous weapons granted by the sage Vishwamitra for opposing all kinds of gods and demons. Several of the overwhelming number of weapons include:

- Discs (chakrams), which are throwing weapons
- The javelin Shuuravara
- The clubs (gada) Modhaki and Shikhari
- The trident possessed by the god Shiva, Trisula
- The bow of Shiva, Pinaka

… and so forth. The higher his Divinity, the more his existence is regarded as something close to Vishnu’s, and the maximum limit of the number of the many weapons he can bring out grows. If it is at A-rank Divinity, while being a Saber, it is also not impossible for him to operate as an Archer and a Lancer.
