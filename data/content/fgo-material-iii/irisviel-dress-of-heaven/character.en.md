### Personality

A graceful woman. A transient Servant who is openly kind like a mother. Irisviel is gentle, overflowing with love and deep affections. And as a matter of fact————she is brimming with curiosity, much more than any other.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Irisviel does not hold favouritism for anyone, and she comes into contact with the Master with gentleness in also the exact same way she is gentle towards anyone else. Due to some circumstances, she is a person who experienced the Holy Grail War in the past, and from that standpoint, she had assumed that some sense of distance should be kept between Master and Servant; it is possible to say that she has a tendency to maintain that distance appropriately.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m Irisviel. My full name is Irisviel von Einzbern. It’s not the case that this is called an intention of the Holy Grail, but…”
“I shall decide on your punishment. One that’s appropriate… for your mischief.”
“Something I hate?… I’m generally commenting, but I believe a priest who uses Taijiquan{{n1}}, is expressionless, and likes unbelievably spicy things is no good of course.”
“————Start, Heaven’s Feel!”
“Please, protect the world. This world that man loved, this world that child should live in…”

### Character Image

A sneaky person who came out of the Holy Grail. Someone who is the same as the terminal of the Holy Grail.

That is to say, by what kind of cause did this miracle happen? A terminal of the Holy Grail. An infant who returned to the Greater Holy Grail had transformed into a Servant as its bunrei. Here, Irisviel continues to protect a certain Guardian cursed by fate, being close to this person, yet far away from that same person, no matter where they are.

Unlike the nature that signifies the contaminated Holy Grail————“All the World’s Evils”, that is hidden within Fuyuki’s Holy Grail, Irisviel is strongly being endowed with the profile of the mother “Irisviel von Einzbern” as a wife. She is in no way a proper Divine Spirit, but if one were to apply her as a Divine Spirit for argument’s sake, she is probably an existence that is endowed with an Earth Mother Goddess’ disposition.

Why has she materialized? What will she do as a Holy Grail when she comes into contact with a person who has the qualifications? An answer has yet to appear for either enigma.
