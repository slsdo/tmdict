Since Iri is a character a lot of people know about, there was awfully a lot of pressure on me. Given that her design was where I simply put all of my own designs that I had already made for her together, I took more time drawing her than the other charactersâ€™ pictures I was responsible for. I believe the people who have Iri also knows this, but because she was used for an event distribution reward as a welfare, her outward appearance in her Ascensions is constant; however, to tell you the truth, she was initially not supposed to be distributed, and I had even drawn the pictures of her 3 stages similarly like the regular Servants. In the future, Mr. Takeuchi accompanied me in her specification changes, and I got to draw up a rough design in which I picked the best points in each of her 3 stages, which then resulted in her present appearance. Because she is a distribution character, it appears many people have obtained her, and I am very happy for that. (Shimaudon)
