### Tool Creation: A

One can produce devices that carry magical energy.

### Territory Creation: B

Creates a “Workshop” that is an advantageous position to oneself as a mage.

### Divine Core of the Goddess: C

A Skill that expresses one being a perfected goddess. It has the effect of preserving the absoluteness of the mind and body. It mitigates almost all mental interferences, prevents the body from growth and prevents the figure from change no matter how many calories are absorbed. It is a composite Skill that comprises the Skill Divinity.

Since she is not a bunrei of a proper Divine Spirit, it results in the rank stopping at C.
