### Personality

If she was to be compared with something, it’d kind of be a large-breed dog that distrusts humans.
There’s wisdom, but since she’s a Berserker anyhow, she can’t convey her own feelings.
Since saying a single word isn’t an average difficulty, she seldom speaks.
Her hobby is saving electricity, so wasting it is forbidden.
Also, since her regulation of emotional control is not going well, there are times when she displays a ferocious personality.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

In order to become as human as possible, she draws near the Master and learns how to be human.
Although grumpy, she’s a good girl Servant that will respond to conversations properly if she sincerely gets along with you.
However, in order to transmit will through hand signals and gesticulations, the Master must improve their gesture skills.

### Dialogue Examples

『Naaaaaaaaaaoooooo!!』
『Uu…… Uuuuuuh!!』
『With me, together, come』

### Historical Image · Character Image

Originally a character in Mary Shelley’s novel 『Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus』, a nameless monster.
A man-made life form produced by the doctor Victor Frankenstein by patching corpses, in addition to the power of thunderbolts.

In the novel, she’s a scientifically cast monster, but in this work Victor Frankenstein himself isn’t fictional, he exists in someone as a man who made an artificial human by fusing alchemy and science.

The purpose of creating an artificial human was to recreate the primeval human Adam. That is, 『she』 who is summoned as a Servant was cast as an Eve that would conceive Adam.
However, that ended in failure. Doctor Frankenstein made a failed work, a girl that displayed a tremendous ferocity and couldn’t control her emotions.

The problem was that the doctor himself thought she was a helpless monster no one could lay a hand on.
And, the doctor Frankenstein, by no means a fool who lacked emotions and could only display a ferocious personality, escaped without acknowledging her.

The reason of her existence, the purpose of Eve ――― that is, becoming the mother of Adam, was announced by the doctor. But in order to do that, a companion was needed above all, and the only one that could create that companion was the doctor Frankenstein alone.

An interminable chase drama.
She announces. That the doctor has the responsibility and the crime.
The responsibility of having created me, and the crime of having abandoned me ―――

Although the doctor refused by saying there was no way he could create two monsters in this world, the girl that he once established as a target, exerted her ferocity and persistently demanded.
She killed the doctor’s family, but even so the doctor, far from claiming revenge, ran and ran away.

Why don’t you hate me?
Why don’t you look at me?

Following the runaway doctor she went to the South Pole, in front of the doctor who chose death while fearing and rejecting, the girl finally despaired that she couldn’t be human.
That’s why, she entrusted the Holy Grail.
To bring a companion that would make her human.
Though ――― Some time is necessary for her to realize that, that itself, is her encounter with the Master.
