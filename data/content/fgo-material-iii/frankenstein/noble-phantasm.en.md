Bridal Chest.
A tree branch-shaped war hammer (mace) wrapped in discharged current.
The sphere at the tip is her heart itself, and she keeps it close to her even outside battle.
It works by making electric supply occur through the fin at the head of the original body and the fin at the rear part.
Since it efficiently collects and accumulates wasted mana from herself and the environment, in battle, where surplus of mana keeps occurring abundantly in the surroundings, it can combine with Galvanism to pseudo-act as the 『Type II Perpetual Engine』.

### Blasted Tree: Lightning Tree of Crucifixion

Blasted Tree.
A full-power discharge occurred by thrusting『Maiden’s chastity』 into the ground and removing all the limiters. It pours down with the silhouette of a towering big tree, a diffuse homing thunder.
If the enemy is standing alone and at a short range, it can be activated even without “Maiden’s chastity”. Although it’s controlled through limiters, its power when they’re canceled is overwhelming. But in that case, the user suspends their activity completely. That is, 『death』.
This thunder attack has a low chance of the possibility of giving birth to a second Frankenstein Monster.
Although, she who has died can’t see that result.
