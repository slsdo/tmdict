This Frankenstein is one from among the 3 patterns I proposed. At first, she didnâ€™t have a neck, a design in which the head looked like it was hanging down because of the metal fixtures of the collar and ears. Notes about the difficult to see eyes being mismatched in color, and the heart being inside the mace, were included in the initial draft. Thank goodness you have a neck in the end, Fran-chan.
