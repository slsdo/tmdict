### Lament of the Hollow Living: D

A shrill shout that can’t be known when will end and that increases while on Mad Enhancement.
It deprives enemies and allies without distinction of their ability to think, and those without the capacity to resist will panic and become unable to breathe.


### Galvanism: B

Free conversion, as well as accumulation, of electric current and mana from living organisms.
It invalidates attacks without substance like magical light, magical wind, or magical bullets, by instantly converting them into electricity and discharging it into the environment.
Also, the body is strengthened depending on the amount of stored electricity, and the repair of damage is done more quickly.

### Overload: C

An intentional boost up while being aware of suffering damage.
In Frankenstein’s case, she converts the mana accumulated with Galvanism into more electricity than the maximum permissible level, and bounces the attack power of her Noble Phantasm up by outputting all of it.
Since her body can’t bear it, she suffers damage.
