### Personality

「A nursery rhyme is a children’s refrain. Tommy Thumb’s charming picture book. The initial form of Mother Goose. The sorrowful me to the lonely you. Your final wish, let’s make it true. A romantic flight until nightfall, for the sake of the you and me you dreamed of…」

The Servant known as Nursery Rhyme is a Reality Marble itself, reflecting the Master’s mind, she possesses the special disposition of a Pseudo-Servant based on a shape that her Master dreamed of. Her form will differ based on her Master. She’s an elusive Servant, but when she was summoned as a Servant in the Moon’s Holy Grail War by the little girl that appeared to be no older than 8, Alice, she took on the shape of her Master’s dream.
That appearance reflected Alice’s own, the figure of an innocent and delicate child.
Even with that appearance, Nursery Rhyme herself is 100% a Servant, prioritizing the fulfillment of her Master’s wish.
However, one mustn’t forget. Since children have a cruel side to them, Nursery Rhyme does too.
「…I am you, you are me. For the sake of you who forgot even their own name, I’ll reflect your form completely. My name is nursery rhyme{{n1}}. Tommy Thumb’s charming picture book. The initial form of Mother Goose.」

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Inside Nursery Rhyme, a Servant born from a concept instead of being a Heroic Spirit that existed at one point, the memories of her former Master whose form she once took, are firmly rooted. Her current form and existence are thanks to these memories.
By repeatedly ascending her Spirit Origin, the magical book Nursery Rhyme will regain the form of the young girl. However, without the Master known as Alice, that is nothing more than self-contradiction.
Nobody other than the present Master is capable of guiding Nursery Rhyme that lost her way and giving her an opportunity to discover her answer. Please, find a happy ending to her tale…

### Dialogue Examples

「“Did you forget? About these.
“Pitiful and lovely Tommy Thumb, thank you for the hard work so far, but this is the end of the adventure.”
“I mean, we’re already inside a dream. A veil of darkness has fallen. Your head too, will fall with a plop.”
“Come, kill me like a lie, close the page, goodbye!”」
「Fufu, seems like the bad dream has ended now. Goodbye, lonely Alice (me).
Thank you for playing with Alice (me) till now.」{{n2}}

### Historical Image · Character Image

This Servant is not an existence that imitated an existing Heroic Spirit, but the general term for existing picture books.
The genre deeply loved in England, was established as a concept that collected the dreams of many children and became a Servant as the “Hero of Children”.
The book that later served as her foundation, 『Alice in Wonderland』, was created by the well-known writer, Lewis Carroll. Originally, it was a nursery rhyme that Carroll came up with for the young girls that he was on good terms with.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Introduced in Chapter 4: 「The Death-Barrier of the City of Demonic Fog, London」.
During the limited-time Event, and as we raise the ascension level of her Spirit Origin, she takes on the form of her Master from 『Fate/EXTRA』, the young girl known as Alice, but this is something the Servant, Nursery Rhyme wished for herself.
Summoned in the demonic fog-covered London, she roamed the streets in the shape of a magic book. Materializing as a Servant after having her name guessed right by Andersen, a writer of children’s stories, she was defeated by the Protagonist and returned to nothing. In the Valentine Event, 「Chocolate Lady’s Much Ado about Nothing」, the players fell in love with the figure of her doing her best to give chocolate to the Master.

### Role in Past Works

Introduced in the 『Fate/EXTRA』 series. In the Moon’s Holy Grail War, she imitated the form of her Master, Alice and was given the name Alice.{{n3}} This name is the name of her Master and the Protagonist of 『Alice in Wonderland』.
Recognized as the friend of the Protagonist, she gave words of gratitude to him/her for mourning over the death of Alice in 『Fate/EXTRA CCC』.

### Connections with Characters

#### Andersen

To write such nasty books, you’re really a bad person! Sorry for disturbing you today too, but I’ll have you listen to my story!

### Passionlip

I feel like I’ve done something bad to her… If we meet again, I wonder if we can be friends this time…

### Jack the Ripper

She’s my precious friend. But…I know that it’s not a good thing for us to be together…

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} NR uses the proper Japanese name here instead of the english one that is written in katakana.
2. {{note2}} In the mats, when Nursery Rhyme’s old Master, Alice, is mentioned, her name is written with hiragana as “ありす” (Arisu), however, in Nursery Rhyme-Alice’s case, it’s written with katakana as “アリス” (Arisu). Fun fact, foreign names and terms are usually written in katakana so the name of the titular character from Alice in Wonderland would be written as “アリス” too.
3. {{note3}} “ありす” for the Master and “アリス” for Nursery Rhyme.
