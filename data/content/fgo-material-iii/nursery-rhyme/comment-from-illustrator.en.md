Nursery Rhyme’s physical appearance is a mirror of Alice, but since I thought that wouldn’t be good, her first stage became a book. In the case of the second stage’s outfit too, I made sure it would be different from EXTRA by changing the feel of the clothing to that of something metallic. The third stage was based on my tastes. I’m pleased with the Final Art. (Wada Arco)
