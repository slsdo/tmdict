### Self-Modification: A

The aptitude to attach and fuse entirely different flesh to one’s own body. The higher this rank goes, the further one gets from a pure hero- kaka, kakaka, irrelevant, irrelevant, that’s completely irrelevant!
No matter what happens, it’s as you’ve ordered!

### Shapeshift: A+

I will transform, I shall transform.
I am you, you are me.
I am going to transform, I have transformed.
I am you, you are me.{{n1}}

### Meanwhile: A

Boarding the ship with reliable friends, the journey ahead is full of troubles. What waits ahead is either a hopeful encounter or a malicious trap.
That is, regardless of the circumstances, very interesting.
Another person’s secret is a taste of honey.
Well then, you’re invited to the reverse side of the world!

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} NR uses “watashi” and “anata” for “me” and “you” respectively in the beginning before switching to “ore” and “omae” at the end. “Watashi”, in formal or polite contexts, is a gender neutral pronoun; in casual speech, it is typically only used by women. On the other hand “ore” is a pronoun frequently used by men. “Anata” is a more polite way to refer to somebody while “omae” is a more familiar/rougher way to do so.
