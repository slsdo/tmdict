Nursery Rhyme.
The Servant’s own ability is not the Reality Marble, but rather the Reality Marble itself is what transformed into a Servant.
It reflects the Master’s mind like a mirror, and manifests itself as a Pseudo-Servant based on a shape that the Master dreamed of.
Originally, there is no specific name, but the genre of the picture book is 「nursery rhyme」.
Because the contents of the Marble reflects the Master’s mind, it will be strongly influenced by the Master’s favorite books 『Alice in Wonderland』 and 『Through the Looking-Glass』 that composes the thoughts of her mind. Aspects of the ability include the summoning of the monster 「Jabberwock」 and the 「The Playing Cards」 and fading a person’s very existence itself starting with their ego with the 「Nameless Forest」, etc. These are all influenced by the picture books that Alice read with great delight during her lifetime.
