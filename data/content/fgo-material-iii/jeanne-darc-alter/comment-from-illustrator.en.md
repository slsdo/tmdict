Originally, she was produced as a simple colour change character and was planned to be implemented as an event distribution Servant, but because everybody who demanded for her was pressing us for her appearance, she got to be reconstructed as an official character. Her shading and a bit of her design differ from the Jeanne Alter that appeared in Chapter 1. Because there is a meaning for her hairstyle in having its braid cut off, there was some resistance in having her hair grow out long for her third stage, but I also did this long hairstyle on Jeanne preferably because it was said to be towards a good direction, and hey, it was a good direction to have it be flashy after all.

She was Jeanne Alter (Ruler) at the time of her appearance in the First Chapter. For the development in those days, since it was a time where there was no leeway for us mentally as well as timewise, the only option was to re-use Jeanneâ€™s outfit with a colour change. Be that as it may, given that implementing a character of Jeanne with a colour change in her standing pose is, as one would expect, unattractive, we made sure to turn around the way Jeanne was drawn in the key visuals. Even though she was called an NPC, she was drawn with distorted facial expressions and the like, doing whatever I please without any kind of eagerness, and it was quite a bit of a surprise that many were pleased with that side of her. Nowadays, she became a character totally known for her amusing facial expressions huh? (Takeuchi Takashi)
