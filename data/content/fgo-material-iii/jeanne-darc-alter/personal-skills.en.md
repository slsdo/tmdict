### Dragon Witch: EX

A Skill that musters up the fury of the Hundred Years’ War of the Wicked Dragons. Lower-class Dragon Kind members can be placed under her control and are able to be manipulated with a single swing of her flag. Simultaneously, it also serves as a non-standard Riding Skill, making it even possible for her to ride a Dragon Kind through the acquisition of this Skill.

### Ephemeral Dream: A

A lifeform born from illusions because of an individual’s desire. Because she was born from one’s desire, she possesses a powerful force, but at the same time, she is not permanently approved as a lifeform allowed for existence. After everything is finished, she will quietly start her slumber.
