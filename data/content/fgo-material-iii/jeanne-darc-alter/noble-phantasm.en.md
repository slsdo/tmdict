La Grondement Du Haine (The Roar of Hatred).{{n1}}
The cursed flag possessed by the Jeanne who descended as the Dragon Witch. It stops the enemy’s attack in the same way as Saint Jeanne’s Noble Phantasm, but this Noble Phantasm also swells up that attack, before it reflects it back. Also, its power will increase even more if her allies die, etc. Then, whether it is a slashing attack, a striking attack, or on top of that, a hit by means of a curse, all of it will in the same way be converted into her physical attack power when they are halted by the Noble Phantasm.

The flag can release flames with performance resembling a first-rate Dragon’s Breath. Furthermore, the stake was stuck into her image. Personally for her, “I was attached to… uh, something jagged… and made of steel, and a harsh impression of it remains with me!”, and this impression allows her to create those kinds of stakes in her image for her own use.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The proper French grammar for the Noble Phantasm’s name should be Le Grondement de la Haine.
