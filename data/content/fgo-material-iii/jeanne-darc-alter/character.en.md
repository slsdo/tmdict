### Personality

A dark Jeanne d’Arc dyed in a desire for vengeance. Her personality is extremely cruel and stern, and probably a few people would notice the vestiges of her sainthood in there. She has no kindness towards others, and she will become an object of revenge, said to be only at all of mankind. She always harbours distrust even towards her comrades in her surroundings. She believes in God. And yet, faith does not exist in that belief. She will wage war with her companions against God, and she will simply delight in this cause to kill. She has a liking for destruction done to total completion existing within her————she makes the purpose of her life to keep on killing anything that comes her way, all until she uses up all her strength.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The particulars of her summoning may be extremely unclear, but Jeanne Alter will not choose to rebel once she is summoned. However, seeing that it is a human Master, she will constantly harbour distrust. Also, when she becomes highly tensed, she will start to laugh fanatically.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Avenger. I came in response to your summons… What’s the matter? What’s with that face? Hurry up, here’s the written contract.”
“For there to be something in this world that can be a match for my hatred… no, that can make up for it… Although it was too late, I wonder if this is even called a miracle… Thank you. Hmph, I didn’t say anything.”
“After how rebellious you can be by not calling me your Master, you said you’re going to be a vengeful woman who calls me, among all other labels, your elder sister!?”

### Character Image

Another Jeanne d’Arc, born because of Gilles de Rais (Caster) having wished on the Holy Grail for this kind of Jeanne in the Hundred Years’ War of the Wicked Dragons. As Jeanne lived through her life as a Saint, there is no element that can properly be converted for Alteration. Therefore, Jeanne Alter is purely “a Jeanne d’Arc dreamt of by the people as an avenger”, and properly speaking, there is no capacity to the extent of being able to summon her as a Servant.

However, something once created will not return to nothingness. Jeanne Alter had set a trap on Jeanne d’Arc to work out her plan. By producing an element for Alteration not in the Jeanne of the past, but in the Jeanne as a Servant, she created a core for Jeanne Alter; furthermore, she improved her Saint Graph values through the Counterfeits’ Riot, having publicly transformed into a Servant. Regarding the Counterfeit Heroic Spirits that were summoned on the occasion of the Counterfeits’ Riot, it appears that Jeanne Alter wanted to forget all about their existences except for her own’s.

Since she is not denying Jeanne d’Arc already, Jeanne Alter aims to surpass her. Even for her writing practice, she will not fail in being earnest about it every day. And she is steadily going through a little bit of writing already!

### Connections with Characters

#### Jeanne d’Arc

It goes without saying that Jeanne is a holy maiden. The detestable original of herself. However, since Jeanne Alter perceives her very existence as becoming a pest to Jeanne d’Arc, she enjoys her Chaldea life with an air of smugness… Jeanne d’Arc thinks that sort of Jeanne is a little pleasant, and that should not ever be realized by Jeanne Alter.

#### Artoria Alter (Including Santa)

Someone who is playing the role of something like a destined rival. She is herself when others are themselves. And then against Artoria Alter, who could think of and come to a clear decision while being evil, Jeanne Alter becomes absurdly weak and passive.

#### Gilles de Rais (Caster)

One person who Jeanne Alter has for mental support. Though nowadays, she is going through just a little rebellious phase.

The Servants on the occasion of the Counterfeits’ Riot

“A dark past! That’s a dark past! Just make sure to absolutely not remember that, OK!?”

#### Angra Mainyu

“No way… My senior is so weak…”

#### Jeanne d’Arc Alter Santa Lily

(A gesture of her removing her glasses while trembling and shivering.)
