Gordius Wheel.
The very reason that he is a “mounted soldier”; the chariot pulled by 2 flying hooved lightning bulls. It is able to run through not only the grounds, but even the air as its own domain.
Lightning surges on tracks where ever the divine bulls tread upon.
He is able to summon it anywhere by cleaving the air with the Sword of Cypriot.
Because the chariot’s various parts can be curtailed and stored away, it is also able to take the most optimum form that matches the terrain topography.
In the driver’s spot, a protection field is formed, able to at least fend off blood splashes.
Strictly speaking, this is not a Noble Phantasm, but an armament that exemplifies Iskandar.

Aionion Hetairoi.{{n1}}
The Reality Marble of summoning. The trump card of the Conquest King.
Its deployment is a great, vast wasteland of a desert, with hot winds blowing about the clear blue sky.
It drags in opponents into a terrain without any obstacles, consecutively summons as independent Servants his personal army that he had once lead during his live, and tramples down with a force of tens of thousands strong.
He himself is not a magus, but each and every member of his comrades shares the same imagined landscape, and with every members maintaining the magic it becomes possible to deploy the Reality Marble.
The vital point is the Reality Marble that summons and revives the entirety of Iskandar’s army when he was alive. The bonds with his retainers that crosses even space and time, sublimated as a Noble Phantasm, the symbol of his kingship.
It embodied the charismatic nature of Conquest King Iskandar to its fullest. Upon being summoned, it seems that there are several of those who are better than Rider himself in might of arms, or those who displays the Charisma of B rank befitting of a king of a country. It originates from how when he was alive, he was not a hero known for his deeds of arms, but a hero who fought as he commands his armies.
