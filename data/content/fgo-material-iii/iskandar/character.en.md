### Personality

As his large appearance suggests, he is a man with a large and open heart as well.
Despite possessing the nature of a tyrant that does not take others into consideration, he is a wild king whose desires ends up resulting in bringing happiness to the people.
In contrast with the ideal king, Artoria and the king that transcends humans, Gilgamesh, he is a king that carries to the extreme his limit with a human body. He is bold and broad minded, possesses a high charismatic nature; yet he also dislikes on caring too much about every little things, making the people on his surroundings rushing on their feet.
He had displayed such a manner when he was alive as well towards several nations, recruiting them for a venture never seen before in history, the Eastern Expedition. Although in the end he went back due to all of his retainers admitting defeat{{n1}}, while thinking that that’s just how things went, in his later years those that deprecate the king are exceedingly few in number.
Those who he had fought during his expedition ended up being added to his army; perhaps he is a figure so overflowing in charm that it compensates for his excess flaws.
To add, maybe due to his origins where he plundered before conquering, he also has a kleptomaniac tendency, a disease of pillaging things he wanted with the light attitude of one who’s just going for a bit of shopping.
He would thought “oh, I want that”, and in the end, even if it’s a military facility, there is no stopping his greed. Truly befitting of the one known as the Conquest King.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

In contracts, perhaps he possesses a strong sense of duty; even if the Master’s ability as a magus is low, he would still lend his power as a Servant. Conversely, no matter how excellent of a magus the Master is, if he/she “has low aspirations”, “whose guiding principles are nothing but jealousy, resentment, and grudges”, “isn’t even worthy in speaking as a human to begin with”, then he shall calmly deliver a crushing blow.
He desires of world conquest, but his standing is that it cannot be something given by others, only accomplished by his own hands through and through.
And so, the wish he harbors towards the Holy Grail is not “the means to conquer the world”, but “the means to incarnate for the sake of conquering the world”.

### Dialogue Examples

“Fleeing under the cover of the night is the act of coarse thieves. The plundering of the Conquest King walks away with the song of victory.”
“I am Conquest King Iskandar. I have manifested as Rider in this Holy Grail War.”
“As a concede{{n2}}, how about yielding the Holy Grail to me? Do so, and regard you as friends I shall, and share with you the joy of conquering the world.”
“A king live far more brilliantly than anyone else. It is the word that identifies the figure that enchants the people!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

He is born in 4th century BCE in the royal family of the Greek kingdom of Macedonia.
Due to the influence of his mother Olympias, since he was a child he was indulged in the legendary tales of heroes, believing that he himself is the child of Zeus (who was put on par with the Egyptian god Amon.)
Together with his friends, known as the Hetairoi (king’s companion), he raised his military deeds, embarked on the unification of Greek under military rule upon becoming a king at the young age of 20, established and personally led the army of Eastern Expedition; and not only had he defeat the great empire of Persia but even absorbing the many nations under Persia control starting with Egypt.
Iskandar was a name given to him by the Arabians and Persians.
His Eastern Expedition had extended up to India, but due to his generals’ opposition and the soldiers’ exhaustion, he turned back in Babylon, and died in that land.
As a conqueror, he had established the largest empire ever in history; yet due to his last testament of “the strongest shall inherit the empire”, after his death his empire then was split apart.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In Fate/Grand Order, his childhood manifesting as a Servant had participated slightly earlier, but he made a high-spirited appearance in the event of Fate/Accel Zero Order. He took things in his own pace as ever, greatly churning the situation. He took an interest to a certain Servant whom he had tied a strong bond with and challenged him to battle, unaware that he is on his side.

### Connections with Characters

#### Zhuge Kongming

While he does have an eye on him, he does not view at him any special way. It may be harsh, but said hero acquaintanceship with him is but of one among the many encounters for Iskandar.

#### Darius

His greatest rival. Were both of their standpoint to be just a little bit milder, he would like to share a drink with him.

#### Achilles

It would appear that the bold and fearless Conquest King would reflexively tidy his clothing and address him. He had aspired to him since his childhood, and even as an adult Achilles is the great hero and an objective for him.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The japanese uses 根をあげる. I assume this is a typo on the japanese part based on online search and should have been 音を上げる, can someone (canaki?) confirms this?
2. {{note2}} The line is ひとつ我が軍門に降り. I used the existing FZ translation as a reference, but I dont think this line was translated correctly…. Far as I know, 軍門に降る means surrender but context wise its confusing.
