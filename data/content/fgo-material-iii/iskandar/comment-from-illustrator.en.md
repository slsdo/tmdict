A strong character of various emotional attachments. Even the meaning of the Fate world largely expanding is truly that of the Conquest King, right? The designâ€™s evolution did not have much change, with the third ascension stops at having his armor becoming more splendour. But since his battle sprite is really amazing with Bucephalus as an addition, I think the feedback was really quite something. (Takeuchi Takashi)
