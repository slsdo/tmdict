### Magical Resistance: B

Spells with less than three verses are nullified. Even great thaumaturgy or ritual curses would cause next to no damage to her.

### Riding: A

From an anecdote in which she rode a flying horse as a Valkyrie. With the exception of Divine Beasts, all mounts and beasts could be controlled at will. While this skill would be at A+ Rank following the anecdote, it was lowered as a result of being summoned as a Lancer. It would be A+ when summoned as a Rider.

### Divinity: E

Even with her passable aptitude for Divine Spirits, this is extremely low. Though once a battle maiden of the Valkyries and a daughter of the great god Odin, her divinity was stripped away by Odin himself.
