Brynhildr Romantia

A Noble Phantasm that has molded the deep feelings of love towards the fated person as the spear of magic silver that she employed while alive.

The deeper her love towards the target becomes, the more the weight and size of this spear will change. Shows tremendous effects especially towards Sigurd whom she truly loved during her lifetime. I love you. I love you, I really love you. Please die together with me, my dear-----

(Very effective on targets she believes to be「True Heroes」. Also effective towards Siegfried{{n1}} who has a deep link to Sigurd.)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Siegfried is from Germanic traditions and attestations and Sigurd is from Old Norse but they both have the same elements and origin.
