He has learned magecraft. From another angle, because he understands magecraft, he consequently excels at the methods of killing mages. With this Skill’s ranking, by all rights, it works as a bonus for all sorts of checks during the moments of doing combat against Casters.

### Affection of the Holy Grail: A+

He is being deeply loved by the Greater Holy Grail itself of some era. That love is even equivalent to the world’s greatest curse. Due to the existence of this Skill, his Luck rank is being flipped up to even outside the standard. Without meeting specific conditions, it is possible for him to even breakthrough the abilities of enemy Servants that cannot be typically broken through. However, this good luck is also something that mercilessly steals the happiness of others. He himself is not aware of the existence of this Skill, and he sometimes does not even hear the “voices” being whispered to him by the Holy Grail.

### Scapegoat: C

A set of crafty techniques for one to survive the battlefield.
