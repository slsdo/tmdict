### Personality

Emiya has few emotions, an authentic battle machine. He will definitely kill his targets promptly, without hesitation, and without losing his way. That state of being is the adolescent Kiritsugu Emiya himself. Speaking of that furthermore, it is close to his mentality immediately following the moment where he killed his own mentor, Natalia Kaminski, as the “Mage Killer”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

For Emiya, who exists as an agent of the Counter Force, he has no personal motives. If anything, the Restoration of the Human Order surely becomes the purpose of his actions.

Towards the Master, he boldly declares that they will be “unable to cooperate”, and it may not be understood that the reason he says that is because he very much does not prefer to be on a united front. Still, if possible, in the event that they do deepen their bonds by any chance, it seems he will occasionally express different remarks from what he usually speaks.

### Dialogue Examples

“Dirty work again?… Just fine with me. It’s always like that.”
“Target, clear.”
“You think that’s cowardice? If so, it’ll be your downfall.”
“Aren’t you mistaking me for someone else?”
“In the end, this is no more than what I’m capable of. An Assassin Servant… For this to be the fate of an Ally of Justice, it’s a decent black joke————”

### Character Image

————An assassin who materialized as an agent of the Counter Force.

Emiya is essentially not a Heroic Spirit. Although he is an individual who killed many people as an assassin, his existence has not been engraved on the Throne of Heroes. An “imitation Heroic Spirit” referred to as a Guardian, and moreover, someone who does not exist in the proper human history. This “what-if that probably would have been possible” exists now only due to the threat that attempts to destroy human history itself from its very foundations… in the Grand Order case alone.

As a result of the Einzbern family not adopting the strategy of hiring an outside Master, he did not meet with his wife who he was bound to meet; consequently, he neither separated from said wife, nor did he suffer discouragement that would come because of that separation; as a consequence, that heart of steel remained as steel, and before one would know it, his emotions completely withered away as well; thus, his soul was called out to the Ring of Deterrence.
