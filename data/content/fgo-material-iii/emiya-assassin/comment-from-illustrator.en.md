I received an assignment with the fundamental lines of a red hood and tanned skin to go in the direction of making people mistake his identity for Emiya (Archer), and it resulted in this appearance. While Emiya still has a hero’s charm that is a little like in the olden days, it would have been nice if I produced something that gives off a sort of a prototype impression, you know; although I intended on drawing him a bit younger rather than drawing his appearance in his prime that is known primarily by his acquaintances, I wondered if I made his substance not quite complete yet too as he is surely identical to his prime appearance, or something like that, but as expected, there was an immense pressure put on me. After that, I wondered if I can do THIS and THAT successfully to capture the different nuances of his face in the anime version, Mr. Takeuchi’s version, etc., and although I would not think about this matter to be thoughtlessly overambitious of me, I thought too hard about it, became frightened and fainted in agony afterwards.
