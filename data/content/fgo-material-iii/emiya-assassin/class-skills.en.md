### Presence Concealment: A+

A Skill to erase oneâ€™s presence. When activated, the user becomes almost impossible to be perceived, even for a Servant. However, during the moment of attack, the effect will be diminished drastically.

### Independent Action: A

It is primarily a distinct Skill of the Archer Class. A Skill granted to him because he grew accustomed to mobilizing unaided since when he was alive. Even without a magical energy supply from his Master, it becomes possible for him to remain materialized for about a week at most.
