### Stars to the Heavens: A
### Flowers to the Ground: A
### Love to the People: A

Powerful support skills. They grant various buffs to one party member of her choice.
The blessed hymns from the bride who, in the apex of joy, sees the world filled with light.
Using them as support Skills is the correct way to use them, but when Nero Bride is the only one left, she can use all of them into herself alone, ascending these into an absurd set of Cheat Skills. Truly a Super Egotist.
