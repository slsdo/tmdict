I was the regular Nero for references and felt like I drew her face too stern, so for Bride I had my thoughts of “I want her to feel swee\~eeet♥” diluted in my consciousness. I think I did the outfit variation well. I made it very gaudy and that’s great\~!The Slime tits{{n1}} and the butt in the final picture were both by my own input. (Wada Arco)

1. {{note1}} Not slimy tits, but tits shaped like the Slimes from Dragon Quest.
