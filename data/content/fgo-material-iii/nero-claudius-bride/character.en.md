### Personality

Pretty much the same as Nero, so we’ll be skipping this part. THIS IS NOT OUT OF LAZINESS!

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

While the normal Nero Claudius represents her life as the “Emperor Nero”, this one represents her life as a “bride”.
She acknowledges and affectionately respects her Master and likes to have them watching over each other as people who walk side by side and keep constantly growing.

### Dialogue Examples

“Aye, I reenter the stage, in new outfit! Call me bride Saber, or Nero Bride!”

“I am glad to be getting stronger, but with this size, my dress won’t last much longer…”

“Why did I change into a wedding dress, you ask? Huhuhu, it is evident. Because! I! so wanted to!”

“Sunrays of spring, dancing of flowers! The winds of May brush against my cheeks, while blessings reach beyond the stella… Open, Nuptiae Domus Aurea!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A guest fighter from Fate/EXTRA CCC.
The emperor of roses in new outfit: a snow-white dress.
The new outfit changes her mood, making her fighting style different from her standard form. Her favorite sword, Aestus Estus, got the memo and changed its blade from red to silvery white.
She was conceptualized in Fate/EXTRA CCC as an extremely niche fetish, with her wedding dress being born from the thematic question of “what would be the most charming restraining tool for a woman?”.
That said, Nero is so fixated in her bride mood that she fails to see any problems with this.

…One alternate possibility.
Her source is Fate/EXTRA CCC but she is not the Nero that appears in CCC.
A snow-white Servant who died before she could ever meet her fated spouse and kept fighting as a Servant without ever finding a soulmate.In other words, this is her form that sunk into dreams without ever taking part in that virtual world’s Holy Grail War.
Her Bond 5 My Room line as a top contender for the most powerful among all Servants.

### Connections with Characters

#### Tamamo no Mae

This new Fox Wedding Skill is far too clever. What gives?

#### Altera

I’m somewhat interested… I mean, look at that brown skin and that unexcessive buxom… Fine, very fine! Even as an enemy, I’m find myself charmed by her!

#### Emiya

Emiya? Not Nameless? What are you, a bat!?{{n1}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Aesop’s fable of the cowardly bat. The birds and the beasts were at war. A cunning bat observed this and whenever the beasts were winning, he would appear to the beasts and say “I’m covered in fur, so I’m on the beasts’ side”. Whenever the birds were winning, he would appear to the birds and say “I have wings, so I’m on the birds’ side”.The war ended on a peaceful settlement, but the bat ended up hated and rejected by both the beasts and the birds because he was a two-faced opportunist who keep double-crossing both sides all the time. Since he was rejected by everyone everywhere, he began to hide himself in the caves and only fly at night. Nero is calling FGO’s Emiya an opportunist for being both FSN’s Emiya and FE’s Nameless whenever it’s convenient.
