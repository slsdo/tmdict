### Magic Resistance: C

Negates magecraft with a chant of two verses or less. It can’t block larger scale magecraft, like High-Thaumaturgy or Cursing Rites.
Since she herself has no innate Magic Resistance whatsoever, she boasts a rank unbefittingly low for the Saber Class.

### Riding: B

Talent for riding. Can ride most mounts better than most people but can’t mount beasts on the ranks of demonic beasts or holy beasts.
