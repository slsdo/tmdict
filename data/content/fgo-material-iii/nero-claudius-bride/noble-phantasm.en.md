Aestus Domus Aurea: Marriage edition.
Titled: Nuptiae Domus Aurea.

The absolute imperial range she uses to achieve her own wishes, but redecorated for a wedding.
The special sword move she uses here is the Fax Caelestis (Star-winning Rose of Finales).
It’s just a sword move, but it’s treated as a Noble Phantasm due to Nero’s own statement: “It’s floridness, it’s beauty and the overwhelming marriageness released from the wedding dress are more than enough for it to be considered a Noble Phantasm, are they not? Hm?”.
It is nicknamed “Confession Sword”. See Fate/EXTRA CCC and/or Fate/EXTELLA to learn why.
