### Galvanism: A

Unrestricted conversion of bio-electric currents and mana, as well as storing them.
Attacks with no substance to them, such as magic beams, magical winds, magic bullets, are instantly converted into electricity. The absorbed electricity is used by Nikola Tesla to replenish his mana.

### Natural Born Genius: A

A Skill that displays the natural intellect of one who has no equal.
Excluding those inherent to the body (such as Divinity) or ones unique to heroes, the use of most Skills, at a proficiency level of A~B rank, is possible.
Nikola Tesla does not use this Skill much.

### Pioneer of the Stars: EX

A unique skill granted to heroes who became the turning point of human history.
Every stormy voyage and difficult journey turns from “something impossible” into “something that can be realized”.
Nikola Tesla, who brought a power that belonged only to the beings from the Age of Gods to Earth and raised the level of civilization of the entire world, possesses a high rank in this skill.
