It’s been a while since the last time I had to work on an old man so I did my best. Since it’s a genius scientist, I tried giving a macho build. I’m wasn’t wrong. With each evolution, the additional parts keep increasing in number so how will his final form look like? Until that day comes, I’m looking forward to the coil rotating. (Namaniku ATK (Nitroplus))
