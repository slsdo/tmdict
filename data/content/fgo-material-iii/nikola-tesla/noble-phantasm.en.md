System · Keraunos.
Something that the great achievements of his lifetime and the mystery from a large number of supernatural myths sublimated into.
The ability to manipulate electromagnetism. It possesses such a might, that people are given the impression as if it was the second coming of the Gods of Lightning and Thunder mentioned in a multitude of myths and legends.
Generally, it launches an attack by the means of electromagnetic projection. The existence of this long-distance attack is what qualifies Nikola Tesla, who’s originally not a Heroic Spirit that possess a bow or any sort of shooting weapon, as an Archer.
With the release of its True Name, the surrounding area is destroyed with the 「generation of a limited, artificial fracture in space-time」. It’s one hell of an offensive and defensive Noble Phantasm, but its fuel consumption is relatively poor.
It’s important to pay attention to how much mana one has left since this Noble Phantasm will suck it up in the blink of an eye.
The mana consumption with its True Name released is especially enormous.
(Replenishing his mana with the electricity stored by Galvanism while fighting is his primary combat style as an Archer.)
