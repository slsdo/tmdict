### Personality

A person who has great confidence in himself​, with intelligence to match it.
While it might seem like he’s always boasting, in truth, 「If it’s the real me then I can do it」, he won’t say things he has no such confidence in.
His speech and conduct is exaggerated as if he were always on stage.
It is rare for him to strip off the mask (persona) of a genius.
Thinking about it, there is nobody other than the King of Inventors, Edison, who can make him get serious. However, he’ll never admit that. When facing a Heroic Spirit that possesses genuine intellect, it’s highly likely that he will take off his hat to that someone in his mind, but on the surface, he won’t show any change.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

His attitude towards the Master, in one word, is haughty. A genius-like haughtiness. Basically, he won’t listen to a word you say.
People who wield techniques exceeding human intellect - poets and artists, scientists - are 「main targets of observation」, military men and the like are 「main targets of experiment」 and with a 「fumu」, he will commence his observation of them. In things concerning the Master, he holds no interest.
However, the moment he discovers something irregular about the Master, like possessing 「poison resistance」, it seems like he’ll make them a main target of observation and experiment.

His wish for the Holy Grail is the 「completion of the Nikola Tesla World System」.
A world where the alternating current comes and goes in space itself.
He’s convinced that in the event that it is completed, mankind’s civilization will develop by leaps and bounds.

### Dialogue Examples

「I am Nikola Tesla. A genius.」
「Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Let me show you a part of my genius here.」
「What is God? That’s right, it’s lightning. That’s what people believed since antiquity, and indeed, even without mentioning the names of Zeus and Sakra devanam Indra, it is certainly God. Observe. This radiance that I lead to the world, is great energy itself.」
「Come! I will show it to you!」
「―――The Legend of Mankind・Advent of Thunder and Lightning!」
