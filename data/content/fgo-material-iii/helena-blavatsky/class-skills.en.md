### Territory Creation: A

Creates a “Workshop” that is an advantageous position to oneself as a mage.

Because she possesses Rank A in this, it is possible to create a “Temple”, which is superior to a “Workshop”.

### Tool Creation: B

One can produce devices that carry magical energy.

Upon materializing, Blavatsky will always create multiple copies of miniature automata patterned after “Colonel Olcott”, the right-hand man who once served her, conveniently using them for this and that instead of maids. Incidentally, they are not very suitable for combat.
