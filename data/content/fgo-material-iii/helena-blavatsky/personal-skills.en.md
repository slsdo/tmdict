### Magical Tuning: C

Drastically stimulates, simultaneously, the magical energy of herself and other people who are in tune with her magical energy.

### Mahatma: A

She calls the pioneers who had reached the Root as “Mahatma”, stipulating that they are beings of a higher order. She employs a multitude of Magical Foundations that were engraved into the World, thinking that————she is manipulating powerful magecraft by borrowing power from Mahatma. It is unknown if it is true that some higher beings are providing her with that power, or if she just has extremely special Magical Circuits. The magecrafts that can be used include Summoning, Black Magics, Alchemy, Formalcraft Magic{{n1}}, Rune Magic, Ancient Egyptian Magic, and so on, covering many fields. It is also possible for her to employ the Holy Church’s Baptism Rites.

Also, by employing multiple Magical Foundations simultaneously, she can even “miraculously” succeed in manipulating extremely powerful magecraft. Because it is essential for a lot of luck and chance to factor in this as well, it can be concluded that this simultaneous employment does not always work every time, so the effect becomes as such: “The invocation of extremely powerful magecraft sometimes occur.”

### Search for the Unknown: B

A direct marketing from Ms. Blavatsky who aims for the Root (Truth). It is also a fleeting dream, of her wanting to share with others, in one way or another, the bond with the unknown that she once encountered in the middle of her dream.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} There are two types of Formalcraft in the Nasuverse. The one mentioned in Mahatma’s Skill description is 元素変換, which allows for the conversion of elements, not 魔術形式, which allows one to perform magecraft by using the magical energy from the Mana that is in the atmosphere rather than from their Od that is inside of their body.
