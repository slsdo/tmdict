A giant clad in shining Ether reveals its form alongside a flying object, before burning the surroundings with flames.

“This is an inner mystery of Theosophy that temporarily works as a “reproduction” of the power of Sanat Kumara (a Demon Defender Lord), who’s a deity that came flying in from Venus to the Earth and is one of the Earth’s creation deities!”

“The flying saucer? Um, that was floating by my bedside when I woke up in the morning on some day.”

“My Noble Phantasm? That, uhh, appeared out of some letters that were delivered to me from Mahatma. Hey, in the beginning, it was soo small. It had really cute eyes too.”

“I met it by chance in the wastelands, during the time when I was travelling through the southern part of Nevada. Yes, the state of Nevada in the United States of America. With a ‘woosh’, my consciousness was transferred to somewhere around the Alpha Centauri, where it was experiencing something a little amazing… and when I realized I came back, I GOT it. The flying saucer.”

Finally, although she speaks of several origins, the true identity of the giant as well as the flying object is unknown.
