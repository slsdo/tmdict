At first, I was designing a concept of a beautiful Russian girl in a military uniform, but I settled down with the current design after having a briefing session with Mr. Takeuchi. Concerning the results, I think it resulted in her appearing more like a Caster, but I did not think her Noble Phantasm would unexpectedly become something like that (LOL). (Matsuryuu)
