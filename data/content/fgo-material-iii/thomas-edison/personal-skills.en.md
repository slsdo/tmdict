### Single-Mindedness: B

Shows a super-human concentration ability when immersed in something.
It is said that Edison slept only about three hours on average.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)

### Mass Production: A

The ideal form of the world (America) led by Edison’s inventions.
Can mass produce subordinate mechanized infantry in a nearly infinite form.
The accounts are somewhere balanced, but that’s done by someone not from his surroundings, or something. Since he’s consuming resources from a place unrelated to America, his pocket doesn’t hurt at all.

### Concept Improvement: A+

The unfair privilege of adding to any tool, from all times and places, an additional strong point.
Bows become stronger, swords become sharper, axes become heavier.
Or, by combining it with Mass Production, even a『mass production of arms with destructive power equivalent to low rank Noble Phantasms』 becomes possible.
How can something be improved depends on the rank, at A+ can bestow concepts to nearly every tool except for Divine Constructs.

### Shapeshift: C

Although his head has turned into that of a lion, none of his intelligence and charismatic personality have been lost.
However, since he can’t control his body that is filled to bursting, the status itself is low.
