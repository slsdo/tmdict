World Faith Domination.
Governance over mystery through the Great Three Inventions that Edison built.
Illuminating the darkness, by the device invented by Edison that records reality as it is, the hidden secrets of the world became absent.
Being exact, they’re in a state in which 『they exist, but they’re recaptured by Edison』.
Easily exposing things that display power from the concealed and the secret, it fixes that which energy can’t be measured to zero.
Making the devotion of the people towards Mystery collapse to zero, it’s 『extortion of the world faith』 ――― an Anti-Populace Noble Phantasm.
