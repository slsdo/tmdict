### Personality

Pompous and rough yet somewhat optimistic.
In order to take back the invaded America from the savage Celts, he aims for a new America ――― the ultimate mass production state.
His production includes Servants too, and he won’t admit a pause of freedom.
By fusing totalitarianism with a super sweatshop, he’s a devilish leader.
What follows him is 『an army of DC electric mechanical infantry』, Babbage’s technology secretly converted from steam to electricity.
Eh, what? It’s Thomas Edison’s original, so is there any problem? I also have the patents!
In America, he calls himself 『President King』 instead of 『President』, and dominates the Western region. He’s in a state of war with Medb, who dominates the Eastern part.
He spearheads Madame Blavatsky, who had a friendly relation with him in the past, and the only Servant hired by the American faction, Karna.

### Dialogue Examples

『――― To be frank, it’s a good cause!
Everyone, nice to meet you, congratulations!』
『I’m burdened with the role of pulverizing those savage Celtics, the king that rules this America ――― A Servant and a gentleman that nurtures Servants! I’m the President King, Thomas Alva Edison!』
『About that!
Sorry!』

### Historical Image · Character Image

I can’t find the necessity to talk about Edison’s great feats at this point.
The light bulb, the phonograph, the cinema, the toaster, and other goods of everyday use, are based on his inventions.

Although there are surprisingly few things invented originally by himself, he reconstructed precursor inventions into a more adequate shape for being promulgated…… In that sense he was extremely great, as it is known.
In terms of he having improved humanity’s life level by promulgating inventions, it’s undeniable that he can be said to be a hero.

Even though Edison has popularity, he originally isn’t a strong Servant so far.
However, he who was the only 『leader』――― 『Inventor King』 left in America couldn’t appear in an incomplete form, and exponentially powered up after gaining power from 『America’s presidents』.
Specifically, his head turned into a lion’s. According to himself, it’s not like he deliberately obtained the head of a lion, but since the catch-copy of『king of beasts』 suited him, this face was chosen, he was informed.
He has the head of a lion, but since there isn’t any harm in particular, it seems he’s leaving it like this. Also, he seems to be pleased with not getting tired no matter how much he walks about and his voice resounding better than usual.

A Servant that feels a little like an honest researcher.
In the America East-West War, he’s the 『Inventor King』 leading the United States Western Army.
Since he’s merged with presidents from the modern era that couldn’t become Servants, he has become far more 『patriotic』 than in life.
The war situation is somewhat advantageous for the Celts that have gathered Servants, but thanks to Edison’s relentless resistance and repeated upgrades of the mechanized soldiers that make use of his technology, he’s somewhat holding out.

For that reason, he began planning to separate America from the time axis with the power of the Holy Grail.
That way, he meets the Rayshifted protagonist and company ―――

### Connections with Characters

#### Helena Blavatsky

A reliable mother and best friend. There were exchanges in the past, and the one who taught him about magecraft was her. (is it noteworthy that the kanjis for ‘exchange’ are also the same for AC?)

#### Karna

A reliable partner he fought together with in Chapter 5. Even in Chaldea, he patiently associates with the revolutionary great inventor.

#### Nikola Tesla

Eh? You certainly haven’t got acquainted with this anti-social AC psycho, AC terrorist?
