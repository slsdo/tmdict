### Pashupata: Raised Hand of the Destruction God

A weapon granted to him by Shiva, one of the Three Greater Gods in Hinduism and the one who governs over destruction and creation in that religion. It is an Anti-“Personnel” Noble Phantasm, but that is from its nature of “not because it is exterminating the people in its surroundings all at once, but because it is conducting a check against the enemies within its range one by one, and it allows one to attain ‘Moksha’ should they have failed their check.” Attaining Moksha, in other words, is instant death.

The higher one’s Divinity is, the greater the probability it becomes for them attaining Moksha. On the contrary, Servants that are commonly called anti-heroes will result in their probability of attaining Moksha being lowered.

A bow of flames that essentially cannot be handled by humans (those with a predetermined period of life), awarded to Arjuna by the Flame God Agni. Although it is generally an ordinary bow, by invoking its True Name, it changes the arrows into missiles coiled around with flames. Although they are not homing missiles, because Arjuna is gifted in archery to begin with, they have a precision almost equivalent to a homing missile when further combined with his Clairvoyance Skill.
