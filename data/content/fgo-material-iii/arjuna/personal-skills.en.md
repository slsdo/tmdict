### Clairvoyance: C+

By extremely concentrating at the time of shooting his arrows from his bow, he can manipulate his own sense of time. He is certainly able to shoot what he is aiming at, all while at ease and without being flustered.

### The Awarded Hero: A

The great hero Arjuna was born to be loved by everyone, and sometimes he would be given the necessary things he requires from anyone. As long as he does not have an active cause like a curse, Arjuna will not lack in anything.

### Magical Burst (Flame): A

A Skill granted to him by his Noble Phantasm “Agni Gandiva: Roar of the Flame God”, which was handed over to him by Agni, the God of Flames. Jet propulsion by means of Magical Burst is utilized not for his body, but for the acceleration of his arrows. Arjuna’s arrows reach his enemies faster than a fired rifle bullet.
