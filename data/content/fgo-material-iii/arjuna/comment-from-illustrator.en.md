Although I said that I’ll probably decide to draw Nobbu of the FGO World first for the time being, of these two characters, I ended up drawing this one first, and in some respects, he’s royalty performing like a butler. However, given that he’s a flawless child, he performs flawlessly regardless. Still, my recollection of him was designed with such an image.

Despite the tips of the arrows not being sharp, because they have so much power behind them, there was something like an image where the arrows are cleanly gouging and removing something as they are from the targets, and watching him launch attacks with a wonderful sound within the game, I thought ‘Ah! Hey, it suits them; it’s fantastic.’ Truthfully, his hand during the moment of employing his Noble Phantasm is erotic, isn’t it? (pako)
