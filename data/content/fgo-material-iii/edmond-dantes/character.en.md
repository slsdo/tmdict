### Personality

An avenger to fate and reality. The Count of Monte Cristo always hates the irrationality and malice that is generally in the world. In that case apparently, it appears that his hatred is even projected towards the whole world except on himself, but he is never a demon that hates people who are proven to be innocent. He surely hates, and continues to deny, reality itself that reigns while it is full of immoralities and atrocities.

He defines himself as the “Vengeful Demon of Eternity”. He is full of roughness and violence, hurting every person who approaches him, but————

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

To the Master who does battle in order to rescue human history from its incineration, the Count of Monte Cristo has two forms to select from. Namely, the form of his current self that was revealed as “the self (Edmond Dantès) that was trifled with by vicious fate and reality”, and the form as “a person who got close to the self (The King of the Cavern) that materialized as the idol of hatred.”

Particularly regarding the latter form, before long, it seems he will surely recognize the profile of the Master who continues to struggle, seemingly remembering at first Abbe Faria, his benefactor, or Haydée, a princess of a ruined country.

“He is not Abbe Faria.”
“She is not Haydée.”
“Of course, this form is not even the self that shows my very own self. The Master who walks together with me is just one person in the past, present and future. Even though, the others should not be here. If that is the case, the feelings embraced then is also the sole thing that must be there, and not here.”

### Dialogue Examples

“————Wait, and Hope.”
“I hold no pity. Freely crumble to dust.”
“The path I conquer is endless. I will show it to you as well, what lies there beyond love and hate.”
“Just like that father, will you show me the way, I wonder?”
“… What… are you? To even accompany me in this way, as though… no, you are different from Haydée. You… are you.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The person who possesses the world’s highest popularity as an avenger. His popular names are known as “The Count of Monte Cristo” and “The King of the Cavern”. Due to a false charge derived from an unscrupulous conspiracy, Edmond was imprisoned in the hellish Tower of If (Château d’If), but he did not fall into despair despite that because of his mind of steel, and eventually, he acquired the treasure of Monte Cristo Island and swooped down upon Paris————It was said that he dealt with the many influential people reigning over France, namely, the people who once deceived him, and pulled them down to Hell.

That stern way of life, the revenge tragedy that concealed his identity, his love and attachment towards his lover Mercedes – which were trampled on and snatched away from him – and his journey that led to his reform because of his anguish and remorse, are all acclaimed by people not only from France, but also from around the world, and Edmond is remembered as “the most famous avenger in the world.”

Although the story of the King of the Cavern is viewed as a literary creation of Alexandre Dumas père, it has been confirmed in modern times that “Abbe Faria”, the father who guided Edmond when he was imprisoned in the Tower of If, existed…

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Although his True Name is indeed Edmond Dantès, he perceives himself as a different person from the “Edmond Dantès” who lived as a seaman from Marseille. “The reason is that “Edmond Dantès” gave up his evil nature at the end of an extremely gruesome revenge tragedy in Paris, but I, who materialized as a Servant, continue to exist in the “image of a vengeful demon”. That being the case, I am not Edmond”, or so he says.

“My name is the King of the Cavern (Monte Cristo). I do not know about love, I do not know about compassion; only according to hatred and revenge would I establish myself as the black flames of deep-seated grudges that blaze with light; I am nothing but an Avenger who rages until everything ends in ashes.”

“My favourite mistress (Haydée) is nowhere in this world, so if that is the case, this body shall continue to exist only as a Vengeful Demon of Eternity”————

### General Armaments

The Count of Monte Cristo attacks by projecting his magical energy by means of his hatred. A dark Grudge effect occurs, causing damage to his enemy. Fundamentally, it is a poison where if one happens to essentially receive these attacks, in addition to the direct damage, it causes persistent damage and an abnormal Grudge status effect.

### Connections with Characters

#### Amakusa Shirou

Edmond highly appreciates Amakusa’s way of life.

“That greed that intends to save the world, it is unmistakably the embodiment of human nature!”

#### Jeanne d’Arc

Edmond doubts Jeanne’s current state of life.

“There is no reason to believe that she is not harbouring the flames of vengeance, as if she was not betrayed by the world…”

#### Nightingale

Even if it is not because he can recognize this particular case as a Heroic Spirit, this vengeful demon caught a glimpse of her who holds to herself an unwavering conviction, something that is dazzlingly beautiful, of which the current state of her soul has even reached the domain of an idol.

#### Angra Mainyu

Edmond respects Angra, for it is even possible to say that this one person is the original Avenger.

#### Jeanne d’Arc (Alter) / Jeanne Alter Santa Lily

Edmond is quietly observing their fates, for they had materialized as a new Avenger.
