### Determination of Steel: EX

The dynamism and mind of steel of the man who walked on the path of revenge throughout his entire life after breaking out of the Château d’If (Tower of If) prison, which was even called the Hell on this Earth, that became a Skill. A complete blockade of his sense of pain, resulting in effects such as the acquisition of a superhuman mind and body that is even able to endure ultrahigh-speed actions. It is a composite Skill that also primarily contains the effects of the Valour Skill and the Calm and Collected Skill.

### Wisdom from Predicaments: A

The ability to call upon Luck with a precedence in critical situations. The wisdom brought about by the abundant knowledge he received from Abbe Faria and his own natural intelligence. By combining this with the special characteristics of his Extra Class, it becomes possible for him to use the “Tool Creation” Skill, which is primarily a Caster’s Class Skill, at Rank B.

### Golden Rule: A

The Count of Monte Cristo attained everlasting wealth and political power by obtaining the “hidden treasure” told of by Abbe Faria in the Château d’If, so money is hardly a matter for him to be troubled with.
