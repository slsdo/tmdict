Monte Cristo Mythologie (Monte Cristo Mythology). He, who had materialized as a Servant, is not that one who was saved at the end of his repentance and reform, but rather, he is really that “King of the Cavern” who swooped down upon Paris while seething with a desire for revenge, living as the personification of vengeance. Even though he does not fall under any sort of Class, his flesh had materialized as the Extra Class Avenger, transforming into a Noble Phantasm that sublimated that way of life (one theory is that the “14 relics” he encountered by chance during his lifetime are at least related to this).

Besides allowing him the use of magical energy brought forth from his deep-seated grudges as poisonous flames that bring about death, this Noble Phantasm allows him to not receive any kind of poison, and it reduces the effects of mental interferences. It is also possible to even conceal his own status and Class, displaying false information.

Upon releasing its True Name, the grudges amassed within himself scatters to his surroundings all at once————resulting in his enemies falling into a dilemma where they will begin to suspect and kill each other by mistake.

Enfer Château d’If (Hell House of If). His mental strength of steel cultivated in the hellish Château d’If, transformed into a Noble Phantasm. Not to mention the body, the King of the Cavern can also escape from even abstract prisons such as time and space. By conducting ultrahigh-speed thinking to an extent that is impossible for human beings and forcibly reflecting that on his body, he subjectively realizes ultrahigh-speed movements that is even equivalent to the use of a “Time Stop”.

In “Fate/Grand Order”, he performs a simultaneous multi-attack by means of the “clones” consequently created by his high-speed movements. The flames of dark grudges formed according to his magical energy are released from his multiple clones, giving damage to his target(s).

Attendre, Espérer (Wait, and Hope). A streak of a dazzling, shining hope, existing in the middle of one’s darkness that was filled with atrocities, despair and regrets. All human wisdom can be agglomerated into these two words. Namely: “Wait, and Hope”————

An unbelievable recovery Noble Phantasm. On top of completely restoring one person around Avenger’s own position even from the verge of death (condition of being unable to fight), all of that person’s parameters are temporarily ranked-up.
