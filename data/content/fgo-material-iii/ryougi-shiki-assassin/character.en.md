### Personality

A cold and exclusive personality at first glance.
Although she uses a masculine tone and conducts herself as a man, she’s unavoidably feminine at the core so it’s wrong to say she’s a 『beauty in male clothing』.
She acts like an outlaw, but she gets lonely easily and has the temperament of an older sister by nature, so she takes care of those she’s fond of.
As for why she uses a masculine tone, or why she’s harsh with those with dual personality, please refer to 「the novel: Kara no Kyōkai」.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Although she expresses her despise to being called when there’s an irregular trouble with a 「What’s with that, how troublesome」, you only live once so she approaches the protagonist with a feeling of lending them her power as long as they don’t do something unpleasant as a person or so.
「Meeting by chance, they also call it?」

### Dialogue Examples

「Servant Assassin, I’m Ryōgi Shiki. …… Is that fine as a greeting? What a weird rule, geez…… The circumstances are different, but I’ll go wild when I see it fit」
「A Holy Grail that grants wishes? The hell’s that, there’s a limit to fakes. Sales aren’t allowed in this house」
「Pin-pon-pan. A notice to all the curious ones. The next level is open, so regarding Master, please go ahead and challenge the next mission all together」
「A new request has come. Too many events happen in this mansion!」
「Death Perception ——— Death doesn’t stand in my way」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A girl encountered in the irregular Singularity, Boundary Formula.
Dressing with a blend of Japanese and Western outfits, a tone like that of a man, and the power not to doubt in her actions.
Any of those would ordinarily be regarded as conspicuous rarities.
Because of her idiosyncrasy of seeing death, she’s encountered several strange incidents, and cut them down.
She’s completely unaware of it, but she herself has become one of the urban legends that wanders late at night.

She’s unexceptionally one of the humans that were “burned out” by the King of Magecraft’s Incineration of Human Order, but she’s actually sleeping now, and the dream she’s watching has appeared as a Servant.
If she were to awake from her dream, she’d be burned out just like the other people, but as long as she’s dreaming, she’ll confront the King of Magecraft’s plan inside a 「disconnected time axis」 as a member of Chaldea.
Shiki herself doesn’t care about disappearing if she awoke from her dream, but it seems she can’t tolerate that the people around her would disappear.

### Connections with Characters

#### Jekyll

Very interesting as a senpai with two personalities. Jekyll’s lack of hope of getting ahead is irritating her…… That’s how it looks like, but it seems she’s comforting him.

#### Mephisto

Although noisy, you can’t disregard him for speaking funny.
「But isn’t using scissors as a weapon hard? A policy? I see…… Then it can’t be helped…… Standing out as a character is important for murderers……」

#### King of the Cavern

She won’t say where they match, but they’re Servants of the same type.
「That romantic power isn’t half-bad. That aside, how about you speak in a way that’s easier to understand?」
