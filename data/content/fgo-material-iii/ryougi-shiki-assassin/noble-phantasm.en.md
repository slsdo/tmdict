Yuishiki · Chokushi no Magan.
By opening the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception to the maximum, the target’s “lines of death” are severed.
You may have millions of life-span, recovery power that resurrects from a suspended state, or a stock of hundreds of lives, but since “the concept of death in the individual” is laid bare, a fatal wound is inflicted while ignoring their immortality.

There are lives that have it difficult to die, not lives that can escape from death.
——— In the end, it’s common to all things.
