### Mystic Eyes of Death Perception: A

Something of the highest grade even among supernatural powers, called Mystic Eyes.
An unusual power among unusual powers, a rarity among rarities. The primary factor of death of “living” things, regardless of inorganic or organic, can be read and visualized as a phenomenon that can be interfered with. The world seen from the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception is a scenery of termination filled with “lines of death”, and it’s difficult to face daily life with a proper mental structure with this.
Shiki usually comes to an understanding with this bizarre view by shifting her focus and overlooking everything.

### Eye of the Mind (Fake): A

Tolerance to compensation due to visual interference.
Also called a sixth sense, or foreboding, it’s prediction of danger by means of natural talent.

### Yin-Yang Fish: B

The helix of the Yin-Yang.
Letting live means killing, granting means harming.
Benefit and loss are two sides of the same coin. Just like the relationship between men and women.
…… Residual Pain. This Shiki supplies her NP by losing HP.
