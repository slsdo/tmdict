### Anatomy Knowledge: A

Displays a high-precision understanding of the human body.
A buff to treatment-type Skills or magic.
It enables her to target the opponents’ vital points with extreme precision, adds a damage buff when attacking and decreases the damage taken when attacked.
For Nightingale, this is not only knowledge but also a series of instincts fixed into her muscle memory.

### Nurse of Steel: A

Treats her allies using scalpels, medications, etc. made of mana.
Since it was strengthened by anecdotes of her saving people, it’s possible to treat even severe wounds. She can treat people and Servants equally. She is mostly limited to the XVIII/XIX Century technology, so you can’t expect the same treatment results from other people doing the same procedures.

### Angel’s Yell: EX

A heartfelt yell from the woman known as “The Angel of Crimea”.
It stirs the souls of everyone who hears it, considerably improving their instincts to survive.
