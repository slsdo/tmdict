Nightingale-san, as you can see, wears 3 bags. I designed it this way because I thought making her carry stuff would make her silhouette would look funny with the big puffs on her hip. When the service started and I saw everyone elseâ€™s characters with awesome weapons and got really anxious, feeling I screwed up for drawing Nightingale-san empty handed, so it was a huge relief to find out she fights by just punching and kicking.
