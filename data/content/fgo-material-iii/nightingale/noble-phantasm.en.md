A representation of Nightingale’s mentality when she ran through the battlefields and faced against death and is also connected to the very concept of a nurse as “angels in gowns who save the sick and injured” established in modern age from her own anecdotes.
The image of the giant torso of a “goddess in gown” very similar to Nightingale appears and swings down her sword. It negates all toxicity and aggression within its effect range- In other words, weapons and Noble Phantasms temporarily lose their effects. Poisons (and in a Servant’s case, many other status alterations) are eliminated, swords are dropped from hands, guns cannot spit out their bullets, bombs cannot start their chemical reactions, magic cannot be compiled, and Noble Phantasm cannot have their True Names released. A forcibly established perfect safe space.
It additionally has a recovery effect, greatly restoring physical and magical energy for any number of targets.
