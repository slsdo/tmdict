The request was 「A gentleman robot moved by a steam engine」.
“Just what is a gentleman, I wonder…a bowler hat and a bow tie with a tailcoat and a walking stick” is what I was thinking of the outward appearance as I tossed out elements for a gentleman.
I wrote practically everything down inside a train heading for a briefing session, and after that nothing has been changed other than the balance.
The memory of missing my station because I was too engrossed in drawing is no longer a bad memory now.
Because it had the setting of an 「armor」, I drew something that a person could wear.
On a closer look at the interior of the leg parts, it actually turns into a shape where a person’s leg can enter and it’s an armor with a large width due to its power suit like structure.
While I cheated a bit with the size of the knee armoring and the skirt part’s position, the reason why the hand’s long proportions give the impression that the lower body is a little short is because I had to accept the limitations known as 「human joints」.
On the other hand, since a person’s arm can not enter the armor’s arms, they were allowed to look that weird.
To the question of where the arms of the person inside are, the answer’s the chest part where the human piloting the armor is contained. It’s assumed that the arms are controlled from there.

Instead of the walking stick of a gentleman, the weapon was changed into a drill.
To be accurate it’s not a drill, but a cross between a group of gears extracted from the Difference Engine and a tunnel boring machine.
The official stance on why a gentlemen is wielding something like a weapon of a savage tribe, is that a gentleman does not use uncivilized tools like blades or guns, and you can’t beat others up with a calculator. (I-IV)
