Dimension of Steam.
The brilliant civilized world of his steam engine that would have arrived if the 「Difference Engine」 and 「Analytical Engine」 that he designed during his lifetime had truly been completed――――In other words, this is Babbage’s longing and dreams sublimated into a Reality Marble, his heart and the mechanical itself that he is clad in.
Basically, it’s a continuously active Noble Phantasm. It is designated as a high ranked Noble Phantasm because of its special characteristics and rare nature, but its firepower aspect is only equivalent to the level of a B~C ranked Noble Phantasm.. In addition, when its True Name is released, the internal steam engine begins to work at its maximum output, releasing a high-powered ranged attack.
Since the unique steam engine he’s manifesting is powered by the Reality Marble continuously expanding inside his sealed armor, he must never remove it. If the armor’s removed even a single time, only a lump of steel that carries no meaning will be left behind.
For the specific effects of the armor, refer to 「Armor of Engine」.
