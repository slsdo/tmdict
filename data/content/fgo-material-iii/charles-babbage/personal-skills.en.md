### Single-Minded: C

It displays the superhuman power of concentration by devoting oneself to a single thing. In Babbage’s case, his behavior towards calculations, plans, production and the like is demonstrated. It functions as a bonus correction for his Item Creation skill.

### Armor of Engine: EX

Always clad in a full-body mechanical armor that’s equipped with a steam engine.
Due to this, Babbage looks like a giant gentleman of steel. Removal is impossible.
While physical strength and stamina’s parameters are ranked up, at the same time, a temporary [++] correction is given by the built-in, strange-looking steam engine’s boost function. Although the agility’s parameter is ranked down, the boost is added.
By the way, Babbage’s been smitten with automatons since he was 8. It’s said, that the first one he saw was a female model he met in the workshop of an inventor called Merlin.{{n1}}

### Overload: D

Accepting the risk of self-harm, a “boost up” effect is intentionally applied.
In Babbage’s case, the armor’s steam engine is made to rampage on a purpose to raise its output and increase the offensive ability of his Noble Phantasm.
The damage the steam engine suffers from rampaging is received by Babbage too due to being integrated with the armor.
