### Cosmo Reactor: A

A reactor that’s cosmic, it’s allowed only to the shining Saber.
The reactor reacts to many things. Like the plot, for example.

### Riding: EX

Talent for riding. She can’t manage most mounts and vehicles, but she is amazingly effective when it comes to piloting junk spaceships. To the point that she can make a ship with no warp function warp.

### Presence Concealment: -

Are you implying Sabers have that!?
(It’s actually ranked EX, but it’s sealed since she completely denies it)
