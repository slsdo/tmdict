### Back-up Fire: EX

Using a mysterious communication device, she can have Du Stallion II automatically perform back-up fire.
In a duel between knights, there’s no such thing as dirty trucks and underhanded tictacs.

### Instinct: C+

Considerably downgraded compared to the normal Arthuria, but it ranks itself up to A-Rank Instinct for anti-Saber purposes only.

### Galactic Meteor Sword: C

A power given to Saber that can destroy even stars.
Also known as the sword that absolutely kills Sabers.
Since it’s super-effective against Sabers, wouldn’t you agree that this makes her the greatest Saber of all?
