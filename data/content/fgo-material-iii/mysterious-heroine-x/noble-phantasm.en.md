Holy swords that boast a tremendous power against Sabers.
They don’t launch beams, but they are covered in them. Also, they make this neat low-register woooooom woooooooom sound every time she swings them.
… Hey, I’m sure I’ve heard that somewhere before.
Dual-wielding swords of opposite attributes requires a tremendous power management. That goes to show how out of the ordinary Heroine X is.
It even seems like light and darkness are strongest when they mingle.
