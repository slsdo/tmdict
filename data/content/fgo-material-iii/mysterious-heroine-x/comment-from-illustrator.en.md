She was a character from one of Type-Moon-san’s April Fools’ projects and one I always loved, so I gladly accepted the job, but her design was already complete, so when it came to make alternate designs, whenever I put something in or took something out, it felt wrong… My only option was to think outside of the box, ready to be scolded for it… and so I sent that final form and got the OK against my expectation. But in the end… who even is she…? (sophisticated beauty) (BUNBUN)
