Verg Avesta.
The scriptures of Zoroastrianism, Avesta’s false copy.
A primal curse that reflects the damage one receieved directly to the enemy.
…which sounds good without context, but if the user suffers a fatal wound and dies before the Noble Phantasm is invoked, the condition of 「recieving a wound that barely doesn’t kill me」 is not fulfilled and the Noble Phantasm won’t activate. With Avenger alone you can not win against an enemy; after using this Noble Phantasm, a partner that can defeat the opponent is necessary. Truly the weakest.
