Despite his body covered in tattoos, his attire was that of a simple man so I was worrying what parts to add or remove when he transforms. “Could it be, I’ll have to just change the color of the tattoos on his body…” Since he goes through a strange transformation in his third stage, thoughts of wanting the final ascension’s illustration to be something familiar to the original work’s fans surfaced while I was drawing. Although a design plan of the third stage having Emiya Shirou’s colors (hair color) was submitted, since I have no idea how his colors ended up changing like this, “From now on, I wonder what kind of settings will appear~” is how I’m looking forward to it.
