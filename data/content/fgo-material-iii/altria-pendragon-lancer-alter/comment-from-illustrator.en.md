To be able to receive and draw a really appealing topic of Artoria summoned as a Lancer, I received and drew this assignment with great joy. On the composition of the illustration, when I drew the horse, I felt happy while being thankful that they even attached the horse to her battle sprite. Regarding the size of her breasts as it has been said often, I will insist in advance that it is not because of my own preferences that I beefed them up. (Ishida Akira)
