When she materializes as a Saber, this Noble Phantasm was something that conceals her sword, but now, it is treated as nothing more than a “Wind Noble Phantasm”.

By using Invisible Air together with her Magical Burst Skill, boost effects such as the reinforcement of her agility and super-jump capabilities, and unleashing a long-distance area of effect attack (Strike Air) of the “mowing down type” by releasing the stockpiled wind all at once, are all possible. (Differing from the piercing type at the occasion of when she is a Saber, this Strike Air is a mowing down type.) Lancer Artoria Alter makes use of this Noble Phantasm’s effects to mainly augment her offensive power.

The true form of this is said to be something that fastens the two sides of the World. The Holy Lance is essentially, a “tower” or a “pillar of light” that sews and fixes the outer layer of the World into place, and it is said that if by some chance, this was unfastened, the World that is made up accordingly with the physical laws of the present will peel and fall off, and the many phantasmal laws that were the way of the past would be expressed. Due to the circumstances where she was the “king” who stood in the final moments of illusions and the Age of Gods, she possesses the Holy Lance that hid this tremendous power.

By releasing its True Name, it will result in the Holy Lance releasing a fragment of the power of the light that shines at the Farthest Ends. In order to perform its True Name release, it is necessary to lift at least half among a total of Thirteen Restraints. This property serves as the same property as the “Holy Sword of the Planet that saves the world.”
