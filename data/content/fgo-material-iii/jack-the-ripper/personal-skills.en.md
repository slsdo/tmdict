### Murder of the Misty Night: A

Since her characteristics are that of a murderer rather than an assassin’s, she, the assailant, always gets the first move against the enemy, the victim.
However, this only applies at night.

### Information Erasure: B

The moment the confrontation ends, the information about things like her abilities, true name and features are wiped from the opponents and eye-witnesses’ memory.

### Surgery: E

Using her blood-stained scalpels, she can provide medical treatment to the Master as well as herself.
Although the visual aspects cannot be guaranteed, for the time being, she’ll manage somehow or other.
