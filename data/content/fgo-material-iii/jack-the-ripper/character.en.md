### Personality

Although she’s innocent like a child, she knows she is a Servant and when it comes to battle, she is extremely quick-witted.
Love and the desire to kill coexist inside her, since she loves her loved ones, there is a risk of her murdering them.
Since, originally, she’s an existence that shouldn’t have been born, she’s brimming with curiosity and wants to thrust her head inside everything.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Whether the Master is a man or a woman, if they have the shape of a human, she’ll call them 「Mother」. The nicer the Master is, the more emotionally attached she’ll be, and, despite being Chaotic Evil, she’ll show self-restraint to a certain extent. However, extreme caution is advised since there might come a time when she’ll want to return to the womb saying 「The deeper our love becomes, the more we want to crawl inside your abdomen」.

「We want to return to Mother’s womb」 is the wish she wants to entrust to the Holy Grail; in search of the place where she can be at comfort, she continues to wish for this from the Grail.

### Dialogue Examples

「From now on, it’s Hell. We are flames, rain, power――――we’ll slaughter you here. The Holy Mother of Dismemberment(Maria the Ripper)――――!!」
「The wish for the Holy Grail…is to go back inside Mother. For us, that is all we need.」
「Hold us tight…Hey? If it’s for Mother’s sake, we’ll do anything.」

### Historical Image · Character Image

The most famous murderer who will never be recorded in history――――That’s Jack the Ripper… If a crime similar to what tha murderer committed happens, they’ll call the perpetrator the 「Modern-day Jack the Ripper」 and each time - 「In the end, who in the world was he (she)?」 - an argument like this will unfold.

The reason his (her) name gets mentioned by people like this is that he was an enigmatic existence shrouded in mysteries.

It’s a common occurrence for humans with power, like Gilles de Rais and Elizabeth Báthory, to go insane and carry out inhuman actions and this won’t change no matter the era. A bizarre event will take place in any era, such as the concept of a murderer.

However, Jack the Ripper was a first in every aspect. Jack’s targets were prostitutes from downtown where there was no money or anything. He did not do it for the gold or the body, he only left behind a gruesomely bloody murder scene that seemed to scream 「I just want to destroy a human body」. There were no witnesses or clues, an unidentified serial killer――――Jack the Ripper was that sort of an existence.

The identity of this time’s Jack the Ripper who was summoned as an Assassin is a vengeful aggregation of 「children who could not be born」.
The body of a little girl formed by a large number of evil spirits pursuing their mothers.
However, since she is nothing more than an evil existence, her wish is not pleasant at all. She wants to return to her mother’s womb.
With the body that has already taken the form of human being, she wants to go back into her mother’s belly.

It is a hopelessly mistaken wish, but she does not desire anything else than that. The better person her Master is, the better her compatibility with them will be――――but no matter how good of a person they are, they should be able to understand that granting her wish is impossible.
For Jack the Ripper to find a new wish, it all depends on her Master. I hope they’ll both fight hard.

…In any case, since this time, Jack the Ripper was summoned as an Assassin, she appeared as a little girl, however, if she was to be summoned as a different class, she would materialize in a different form.
In case Jack is summoned as a Berserker, due to all the minuses adding up, they would do a complete 180 and a 「level-headed Jack the Ripper whose mind did not collapse」 would be born.
