The mantle-like clothing she has during summoning is an abandoned coat for men that she found somewhere. Catching glimpses of the underwear and the bare skin{{n1}} is an essential point to wearing thick clothes. The second ascension’s liberal look is aiming at the gap between it and the first ascension with its design. The character’s image, which is adorably small, but gives off the feeling that you’ll be cut if you let your guard down, is a fittingly frightening weapon. Even though the large variety of knives she possesses won’t see much use, thinking about what purpose each could serve while I was arranging them was a ton of fun. (Konoe Ototsugu)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Konoe (Jack’s illustrator) mentioned チラリズム here. It’s hard to explain, but I’ll give it a try.
Basically, it’s a fetish where people prefer to catch glimpses of underwear and the bare body due to some coincidence instead of blatant exposure of a nude body and their unmentionables. They prefer the lucky pervert moments.
…I had to look this nonsense up. Thanks, Konoe. I bet I did not even explain it properly.
