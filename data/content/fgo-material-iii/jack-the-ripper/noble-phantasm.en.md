### Maria the Ripper: The Holy Mother of Dismemberment

Maria the Ripper.
A Noble Phantasm that reenacts the murders of Jack the Ripper.
「Night time」 「The opponent is a woman (or simply female)」 「It’s foggy outside」, when all these conditions are met and the Noble Phantasm is activated, the target’s insides are forced outside of their body and they’re turned into a disemboweled corpse.

In the case the conditions are not met, it’s limited to plain damage, though it sharply rises in power every time one of the conditions are fulfilled.
Since this Noble Phantasm is not an attack performed with a knife, but a type of curse, it can be used even at long-range.
To defend against the Noble Phantasm, instead of physical defensive power, a resistance against curses is necessary.

The Mist.
A Noble Phantasm that creates a barrier of mist.
The mist of sulfuric acid, created with magic power, is the Noble Phantasm itself.
If it’s a Servant, they will receive no damage, but their Agility will decrease by a rank. The user can choose who will and who won’t be affected by the mist among those inside her Noble Phantasm.
Since you lose your sense of direction inside the mist, a B or higher ranked “Instinct” skill or some kind of Magecraft is necessary to escape.
(It is not used in 『Fate/GO』.)
