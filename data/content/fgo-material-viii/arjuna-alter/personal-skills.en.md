### Anti-Evil (Unique): EX

Power that’s equal to the authority bestowed by someone that brings about the end.

He is burdened with the duty of erasing all evil. He’ll destroy villains that claim to be king, but he is too upright. This is applied to everything except pure children and saints.

### Clairvoyance (Transcendental): EX

His clairvoyance supasses the limits of a human being. In a sense, it’s different from Mystic Eyes, it could be said to be the ultimate form of vision.

### Lamplight of the Soul: EX

Arjuna barely managed to protect his lamplight (personality) as human. His brilliance becomes stronger as he repeatedly ascends.

### Divinity: EX

He possesses the highest level of divinity. He lacks any humanity in return.
