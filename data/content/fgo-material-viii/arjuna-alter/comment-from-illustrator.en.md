Even though he’s basically a floating Indian God, he even has the universe in his setting, so I thought it would be good to draw a universe and while I was at it, the face of a space cat{{n1}}; I guess Arjuna-san is very serious. That is his virtue and it is his merit. (pako){{n2}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Most likely talking about the character from Fujiko Fujio’s manga.
2. {{note2}} Pako also drew Arjuna Alter on his own Vimana. A god that looks at everything from above, [here](https://imgur.com/a/ravjR06).
