### Immortal’s Poetry: A

In the Taiheiki’s 16th volume, Nihon Chouteki no Koto (The Case of the Enemy of the Japanese Imperial Court), Ki no Yasuo is sent to subjugate Fujiwara no Chikata, the traitor who served the Four Oni. It’s said he drove away the Four Oni reciting the poem:

> “Be it the grass or the trees
> no inch of the country
> of my Emperor
> shall become den
> to the oni.”

Murasaki Shikibu is a poet who left her name among both the Medieval 36 Immortal Poets and the 36 Immortal Lady Poets. She could easily compose a demon-expelling poem like the above.
By the way, her poem in the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka by One Hundred Poets was:

> “We meet after long,
> yet you depart
> before I am sure
> whether I saw you or not.
> Like the midnight moon hidden by the snow.”

### Curses (Poem): D+

Murasaki Shikibu seemed to have some knowledge of Onmyoudou and you can notice she included some elements of it in a few sections of The Tale of Genji.
Speaking in modern terms, she was that kind of author who “actually studies magecraft to write a novel with magecraft in it”.

### The Diary of Lady Murasaki: B

The diary that exposed Murasaki Shikibu’s methodical personality.
Ever since she was summoned, she chronicles every event that happened in her days here, be them good or bad.
By revising and falsifying the past composed in this diary, it’s possible to cancel a fixed amount damage and injury.
“I’ll pretend this never happened.”{{n1}}
However, the targets and amount of time reversed need to fulfill several requisites.
Actually a Noble Phantasm, but displayed in-game as a Skill.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} She’s saying the same line BB says when she’s undoing damage with Potnia Theron.
