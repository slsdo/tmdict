The first thing I decided is that the third Ascension would be a twelve-layered kimono, so that I could go all in for my personal preferences on the other Ascensions. I believe I was trying to imagine an owner of a poorly illuminated used-books store (like that one Unagi no Nedoko in [Jinbouchou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinb%C5%8Dch%C5%8D,_Tokyo)) listlessly cataloguing the rare books on the end of the hallway. You know, the kind of lady who goes out sometimes, but always with a parasol because she can’t handle the sunlight. The twelve-layered kimono on the third Ascension was too large to fit the card frame, so I’m glad you have this book where you can you appreciate [the twelve layers on their full glory](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXaisB4U8AAf4Us?format=jpg&name=4096x4096). Also, it took me a lot to come up with attack animations, literary characters with no weapons are hard. (Raita Honjou)
