### Personality

Unlike the young Li Shuwen, he is now a gentle old man.
There are still times when he unleashes his monstrous fists, but he tries to keep their use to the bare minimum.

He has reached a state of mind where he tries to keep his own ferociousness in check, something his young self still couldn’t understand, but once he gets into a fight it becomes clear that the fangs he had in his younger days have not dulled one bit, but rather are still being sharpened.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He tends to treat his Master like his own grandchild.
He seems to believe there must be a meaning for having been summoned in his old form, and thus does his best to act accordingly.
However, once he finds that meaning, and if he believes that protecting his Master is the right thing to do, he will give their life for them without hesitation.
He has no wish for the grail.

### Dialogue Examples

“It all sounds nice when people say martial arts are truly mastered in one’s old age, but I wonder how far these fists of mine can really take us.”
“Leave the fighting to me. Or rather, I should say leave only the fighting to me. After all, I’m a man who even after reaching this age had no notable skills other than destroying others.”
“We’ve spent quite some time together now. You stay by my side during my constant training, and even join me for a cup of tea. You are probably the first person who has fought by my side for this long.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Same as the Lancer Li Shuwen.
This time he has been summoned in a form where his unarmed fighter aspect is represented more strongly.
He is an Assassin, but he didn’t live off of assassinating others.
It’s not that he’d be ashamed of that sort of thing, but rather that he’s simply not very fond of it.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Li Shuwen had reached two different peaks during his life: his physical peak and his mental and spiritual peak.
This isn’t necessarily rare, but most Servants usually prefer their physical peak.

However, Li Shuwen will answer to summons even in his spiritual peak.
If one were to describe the young Li Shuwen as a hungry tiger, then the old Li Shuwen would be a sleeping tiger.
However, his gentle sleep only comes due to having already mastered his fists to their peak.
Once he awakens from his sleep, he will exterminate all enemies with such skill that even the hungry tiger would be no match for him.

During his younger days, he had the resolve to throw anything away for a duel, but now that he’s old he’s come to realize his fists exists solely to protect the things precious to him.

Being prepared to give up his life to repay something as simple as a one night’s lodging and meal is now Li Shuwen’s moral code.

### Connections with Characters

#### James Moriarty/Yagyuu Munenori

As fellow old men, they always seem to have old man things to talk about.

#### Li Shuwen (Lancer)

He hasn’t been able to get rid of the temptation of fighting to the death with himself, and fears he won’t be able to contain himself once they meet. Even if he managed to contain himself, he knows his younger self would attack him immediately, and he would be intent on taking him on.

#### Consort Yu

Her shoulders are too stiff.
I will have to get my spea…I mean, my needles.

#### Qin Shi Huang

Even if it was something that occurred in a Lostbelt, to think they’d have an old man like me serve them by their side…
I am most honored.
