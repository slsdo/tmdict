You did it Master Shuwen, you equipped those suspicious glasses!!!! I figured it would be out of character to have his designs be a little over the top or dynamic; surely this man would be incredibly strong even when naked, so using Takeuchi’s rough design of Old Li Shuwen as a base, I made his other stages as simple yet cool as I could. This grandpa is still super strong and badass, right!? That’s how I wanted to draw him!!!! (Wada Arco)
