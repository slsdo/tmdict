### Chinese Martial Arts (Baji Quan): A+++

One of china’s principles. This is proof of how much one has mastered the martial arts whose goal is to have the practitioner become one with the universe.
Unlike other skills, learning this one is extremely difficult, and only at rank A can one finally claim to have “obtained” it.
Moreover, if one adds the +++ ranks to it, it means they have become a master among masters.
The use of the spear is usually considered his special ability, but when Li Shuwen is summoned as an old man, he prefers ending things with a single strike of his fists.

### Sphere Boundary (Zenith): A-

A skill where one uses their own qi to feel their surroundings, or to erase their own presence.
Reaching mastery in this skill allows one to become one with nature, even giving one the ability to become completely invisible.
Due to his old age, Li Shuwen has achieved further mastery in this technique.
Even in the middle of a heated battle, he has the ability to completely disappear in the blink of an eye.

### Yin Yang Intersection: B

An ability possessed by all humans to switch their own nature.
Although Li Shuwen leans more towards yang after having become old, he still hasn’t lost his fierce claws, and can freely switch to yin in an instant and slaughter his enemies effortlessly.
His cold-heartedness in battle has not been lost.
