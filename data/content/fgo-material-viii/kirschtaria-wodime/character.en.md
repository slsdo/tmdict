The leader of the Crypters.
The traitor of humanity, who welcomed the Blank Earth Phenomenon, erasing Pan-Human History.
He has some signs of elitism, but there is a valid logic behind the imagined future he leads people towards.
This young man may look like a cold and composed aristocratic scion, but he treats people kindly and never imposes his authority on others.
He’s confident without being arrogant. Cool-headed without being cold-blooded.
Although he’s the greatest traitor ever in the eyes of the humanity up to the year 2017, his goals and ideals are beneficial to humanity and undeniably a great turning point.
He established a line of Magecraft that allows him to defeat Servants while still human.
His mage lineage has been in the Department of Astromancy since before the Earth became blank, and for that reason he was never treated as a threat, as his theory was regarded as genius on paper but impossible to put to practice.
