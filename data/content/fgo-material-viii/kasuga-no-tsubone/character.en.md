### Historical Image · Character Image

Kasuga no Tsubone is the nursing mother of the third shōgun of the Tokugawa Bakufu, Tokugawa Iemitsu (childhood name Takechiyo). Her real name is said to be Fuku.
Her father is the chief vassal of Akechi Mitsuhide, who defeated Oda Nobunaga at the Honnō-ji Incident, Saitō Toshimitsu.
Her mother is the daughter of Inaba Ittetsu, a commander who achieved many military exploits and was one of the Mino Triumvirate, Oan.
Toshimitsu was later defeated in battle and executed, but Fuku was accepted into the kuge{{n1}}: Sanjōu Nishike{{n2}}, which had a blood relationship with her mother, and was raised receiving a high-level education in song and calligraphy.
Later, Fuku married Inaba Masanari. Masanari is a commander that serves Toyotomi Hideoyshi, and that would later become Kobayakawa Hideaki’s chief vassal.
Kobayakawa Hideaki betrayed the Western Army in the Battle of Sekigahara and joined Tokugawa Ieyasu’s side, and led the Eastern Army to victory, but Hideaki passed away in the year 1602 and Masanari became a rōnin.
At that time, hearing the Bakufu was looking for a nursing mother for the second shōgun Hidetada’s legitimate son, Takechiyo, Fuku volunteered for it.
As a result, she won social status as the Tokugawa’s nursing mother.
It is said that Masanari’s merit of war and Fuku’s education, as well as the fact that she had delivered many healthy children and had a good production of milk, were the reasons for her being accepted.

Fuku brought up Takechiyo pouring all her love to make him a great shōgun, the heir of the Tokugawa, and Takechiyo became emotionally attached to Fuku.
However because of that, the relationship with his real mother, Oeyo no Kata, didn’t go well.
It is said that later, when Eyo no Kata gave birth to his little brother Kunimatsu, and tried to make Kunimatsu the successor,
Fuku directly appealed to the retired leading figure Tokugawa Ieyasu and took the pledge of 「Takechiyo is the heir」 (in posterior fiction).

But no matter what Fuku raised Takechiyo to become the great shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu.
Fuku, who had come to seize power as the shōgun’s Court lady with a private chamber, developed the world of「Ōoku」, whose system hadn’t been established that much despite having existed until then, and laid the foundations of Ōoku as 「a firm place (system) for the birth and protection of the heir of the Tokugawa」.

In 1629, as the relationship between the Bakufu and the Imperial Court deteriorated, the Bakufu dispatched Fuku, who had a connection with the Kuge · Sanjō Nishike.
That time, the title that was bestowed to Fuku, who achieved an audience with Emperor Go-mizu-no-O, was 「Kasuga no Tsubone」.
