### Personality

Even though he gives his name as Lu Bu, he is serious.
However, his nature is rough. He is easygoing in most things, and gives off a calm presence too.
That is certainly an excellent horse---------

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Carrot please.

### Dialogue Examples

“Rider has manifested here. This peerless body of mine will now become your power.”
“I don’t have a rebellious nature at all. Fufuh...”
“Neigh!”
“Carrots?”
“I am Lu Bu Fengxian! Also known as the Flying General. Y-yeah… Of course. Y-yes.”

### Character Image

The Flying General Lu Bu, whose actions are told of in books and stories such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
A legendary warrior and general boasting peerless courage, he is said to have continued to fight until the end of his life. With his favorite horse, Red Hare, he ran through the battlefield.

“And now, with his Noble Phantasm, Lu Bu has become one with Red Hare! Surpassing even the centaur told of in Ancient Greek mythology, and combining man, horse, armor and arms to become the strongest man-horse warrior! Like Innocent Monster or something. In other words, I am Lu Bu! Neigh!”

Neigh.
There is not a single reason to doubt this impassioned story.

<>

A ferocious appearance that can no longer be called human---------
At the same time, filled with a severity like a war god that overruns the battlefield.

<>

The true name “Red Hare” is proudly displayed.
But about that truth, he stays silent.

Favorite food: carrots
But anyway, this horse has a nice voice.

### Connections with Characters

#### Lu Bu

Ooh, Lu Bu! Lu Bu!
I am Red… Neigh, n-no, I am Lu Bu as well. It is true. In other words, together we are double Lu Bu! Magnificent!
That being so, how about an EXA-Red Form?

#### Chen Gong

Soldiers are easily misled. I understand that. But I’m wondering what they think about suicide bombing. That being so, has there been development towards a new form? I think it would be good for a horse to be able to fly through the sky.

#### Cao Cao / Guan Yu

Neigh!

#### Llamrei / Bai Long / Dun Stallion

Neigh.
