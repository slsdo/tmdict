Red Form.
Known as Lu Bu’s horse, Red Hare has the ability to perform a “combination sequence” with the Fierce Flying General Lu Bu--------- So it is rumored in small parts of Clock Tower.
It’s true.
That really is the rumour.
As a Servant, Red Hare runs through the battlefield as an invincible man-horse soldier with high mobility and toughness, with a centaur-like appearance due to the side effect of the Noble Phantasm that makes the horse and rider one. Even without Lu Bu.
So---------
Although he calls himself “Lu Bu combined with Red Hare”, he is just a horse… Red Hare. Sorry for fooling you so far, everyone. Not giving Lu Bu a ride, nor combining with Lu Bu. It is no more than a centaur soldier mode that exists as the side effect of a Noble Phantasm.
Whether you point out that fact or not depends on the breadth of your tolerance.
(A continuously active -type Noble Phantasm. Fundamentally not used in Fate/Grand Order)

### Imitation God Force: False · The Five Soldiers of the War God

Imitation God Force.
He doesn’t have the Noble Phantasm “The Five Soldiers of the War God”, which is called Houtengeki, that Lu Bu possesses as a Heroic Spirit. What he releases as a Noble Phantasm is “The Five Soldiers of the War God”’s Shoot Mode… Or a big shot that brings it to mind.
However, it is not released as magical light like a large-bore cannon, but is just an “enormous spear” shot as an arrow from a strong bow.

As a result of having sought a powerful arrow, he may have decided that “It’s faster to shoot a spear…”
