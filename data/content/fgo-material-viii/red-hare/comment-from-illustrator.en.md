With a horse’s head, a person’s body resting on a horse. … It was a horse? I made it more than a year before the release of FGO, but I think it’s in the storehouse~, FGO is exciting but I can’t say I’m participating~ Whatever your thoughts, to think that you’d receive a character like this, with a double Midorikawa no less. (Midorikawa Miho)
