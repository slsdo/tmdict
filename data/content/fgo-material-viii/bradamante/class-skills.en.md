### Magical Resistance: A

Nullifies magecraft spells that are Rank A or below. Modern mages would not be able to wound Bradamante with their magecraft.

Bradamanteâ€™s original Rank in the Magical Resistance Skill is C, but it is being increased considerably to its current Rank due to the effect of one of her Noble Phantasms.
