Bradamante is named as one of Charlemagne’s Twelve Peers, and given that I did not know who Charlemagne was until I got the order to design Bradamante, I searched up all sorts of things about them to come up with Bradamante’s design. The rough design I submitted in the beginning was her with fairly simple clothes, and because ‘wings’ was the motif of her design, the wings at the front of her rough design was emphasized. But I have made Bradamante’s design brighter and more feminine as well with the wings motif also being smaller in its emphasis, and then having drawn a good backside for her, I settled down with her current design. I am personally pleased with the design of her magic shield Noble Phantasm. (saitom)
