### Merit of Clermont: B

One’s pride and mentality as a person who was born in the House of Clermont becoming a Skill.

In order to catch up with her elder brother Renaud and his fierce swordsmanship techniques, Bradamante tried every single thing. Even if she was an ordinary person, even if she might be ordered to do something bad, and even if it was a gruesome battlefield, she will run past people from behind to move forward. Bradamante will not give up in any way, and she will catch hold of victory.

### Knight of the White Wings: B+

A Skill that demonstrates the intrinsic robust health of one’s body and the ability to continue combat. It comprises the effects of the Battle Continuation Skill and some parts of the Robust Health Skill.

Even if she tumbled down to the depths of Merlin’s Cave, Bradamante would be okay.

### Magic Cancellation: A

Cancels magical effects on oneself or one of their allies. If it is a magecraft that is Rank B or below, it is automatically cancelled, but in order to cancel magecraft that is Rank A or above, a Luck Check becomes necessary.

It is a Skill originating from Bradamante’s Second Noble Phantasm.
