### Personality

A knight who does not give up. Bradamante is strong in both mind and body. If it is for the sake of realizing her feelings, she will face anything and everything, no matter the number of times she must do so. She does not approve of coming to grips with misfortune as misfortune. A pure-hearted girl knight who always tries to have faith in justice and aims to do good even when in a predicament.

Bradamante never yields before any hardship, and when she thinks of how to deal with them, she will always carry it out sooner or later. It is a work that can be done with her unwavering emotional strength… but occasionally, even a complaint briefly escapes her mouth.

Bradamante hates mages because she suffered unpleasant things from them during her lifetime. However, she excludes Merlin from them. As a matter of fact, she has a connection with the Grand Mage Merlin, and in her adventures when she was alive, she has been receiving advice from him through his priestess. As far as Bradamante is concerned, Merlin is a subject of reverence.

### Attitude towards Master

Bradamante recognizes the Master as someone with a connection to Merlin, and even though she knows they are a mage, she will not hate them or do other things such as that. On the contrary, from the way it seems, she even thinks that Merlin’s return to the present is within the capacity of the Grand Mage.

### Dialogue Examples

“Bradamante, one of Charlemagne’s Twelve Peers. On behalf of the Great King Charlemagne, I will become justice!”
“Let’s go, Master! Chivalry is surely something that needs to be diligently tempered!”
“Paladins can’t be defeated! There’s only victory!”
“Ouch!… Lord Merlin, Bradamante won’t give up. I’ll do my best!”

### Character Image

One of Charlemagne’s Twelve Peers. A pure-hearted girl knight. The Knight of the White Wings. Bradamante was born as the daughter of Duke Aymon of the House of Clermont and Aya, the King’s younger sister, and she has an elder brother, the swordsman Renaud, who owns the magic sword Froberge and is one of the Twelve Peers just like her. Similar to her elder brother, she is known far and wide as a brilliant swordswoman. It is said that at the time when Charlemagne’s army was caught in a dilemma during their battle against the Great King Agramante, Bradamante herself personally served as the army’s rearguard and proceeded to engage in a magnificent duel with the enemy general Rodomonte, the King of Algiers.

Before long, Bradamante falls in love with the knight Rogero, the leader of an enemy nation and a descendant of the hero Hector, and for the sake of having this love fulfilled, she fought against many hardships. Even when he was abducted by an evil mage; even when he was swayed by a witch; even when a Greek prince came to propose marriage to her – Bradamante did not give up each time by any means and continued to face them all.

For the Bradamante who materialized as a Servant, it is possible to say that Rogero makes her very identity as “a Heroic Spirit who continues to run after a radiance.” So long as she is the “tale” named ‘Bradamante’, it is assured that she will continue to search and pursue the “hope” named ‘Rogero’. That is to say, she will never, not even once, reach a happy ending like when she was alive————for she is surely someone who has been defined as “a tale of an eternal quest”…

“Of course, I’m a bit sad! But I’m a Holy Knight before all of that, so that’s why I’ll do my very best with all my energy for the sake of taking back our world!”
“Hey, that’s what’s good about you. I’m directly addressing you in your mind by the way.”
“Lord Merlin!”

### General Armaments

Bradamante’s armaments are a shield, which is her Noble Phantasm, and a one-handed spear. She regards combat techniques that combine shield and spear as her forte. She is not the type of Lancer who would stake everything on her spear. It seems noteworthy that shield-and-spear users are sorted into the Lancer Class.
