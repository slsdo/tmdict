At the time of CCC, I couldn’t put her but since the Sakura Five are established let’s try a rough drawing as an experiment~~~~~~~! To think that the day in which I would seriously wake up the children I drew with a loose mood…! Me from that time… Think about… The details…! Wish I could borrow a bit of the cuteness of the version drawn by Takenoko Seijin-sensei in Fate/EXTRA CCC FoxTail. My Room’s really huge. (Wada Arco)
