Airavata King Size.
A Noble Phantasm with one of the myths in Indian mythology, the anecdote of the churning of the Ocean of Milk, as a motif.
In order to continue living on the devastated land, the gods sought the wonder drug of immortality · Amrita.
The sea that covered the world · the Ocean of Milk had to be churned to make Amrita, so the gods cooperated with their enemies the Asura, churned the Ocean of Milk by using the Mandala Mountain as an axis to revolve the world, and gave birth to several lives and elixirs.
Airavata is the name of a giant white elephant that appeared from the Ocean of Milk at that moment.

The Kingprotea limitedly summoned in Chaldea is always being 『pressured』.
That’s the Counter Force of the world, and the limits of the material world that isn’t a cybernetic world.
This Noble Phantasm temporarily gets rid of that 『pressure』.
A Reality Marble in which Protea uses the Mana Core in her interior, deploys the cybernetic world SE.RA.PH, and returns to her original size.
When the Noble Phantasm is activated the world is wrapped by a white sea (the Ocean of Milk), and also, by a white mist.
The enemy’s surroundings become the sea, and a giant something appears swimming beyond the sea.
It appears just like a white whale (Moby Dick), and rises while spilling the white seawater.
Protea, who has become of a size that can’t be seen by humans with a sweeping view, simply, with one attack, using her limbs against the enemy, annihilates them.
