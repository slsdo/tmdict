### Huge Scale: C

An id_es skill born from 『Growth Desire』, with 『Self-Modification』 as a base.
Enables limitless scale expansion. Gigantifies the own standard when the level upper limit is reached, and establishes a further level upper limit. This is repeated infinitely. Infinite increase.
She would eventually become a universal-level disaster that destroys stars, but since the more she is gigantified the more the complexity of intellect · functions is lost, an ordinary intelligent being would be unable to endure this skill, and would self-collapse.
In the past it was an EX rank out of the norm, but Chaldea’s summoning system can’t recreate it and it’s ranked-down.
The maximum HP increase from the turn it’s used. This is permanent until 『Infantile Regression』 is used.

### Infantile Regression: C

Shackles put by BB. A safety device that suppresses the infinitely growing Kingprotea.
Returns the own Saint Graph to its default value, and resets the hypertrophied self.
Using it turns the extra maximum HP obtained by 『Huge Scale』 to zero, gains NP depending on the reduced HP, and speeds up the skill charge.
Protea keeps shrinking if 『Infantile Regression』 is used after 『Huge Scale』, but miniaturization beyond the default value of 30 meters is impossible.

### Area Demolition: C

Changes normal attacks to AoE damage. The vast range attacks that large size enemies or above have.
If 『Huge Scale』 reaches an extreme, she would display enough suppressive power to attack not enemy individuals, but the space itself.
(Not used in 『FGO』)

### Monstrous Strength: EX

The average 『Monstrous Strength』 skill that 『demonic entities』 represented by Anti-Heroes have.
But Kingprotea using it, that alone, makes her a threat.
At the moment, the Servants that have 『Monstrous Strength: EX』 are only Tiamat and Kingprotea.
