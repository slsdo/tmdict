### Mad Enhancement: A+

Protea, being a giant and a harmful existence to the world no matter how favorable she is with humans, can’t share her values with humans in the fundamental parts.
Protea’s acknowledgment of thinking that she’s not big but the surroundings are just small,
and that she’s not strong but the surroundings are just weak,
is nothing but a disaster for humanity.

### Independent Action: B

Protea, who has a powerful Mana Core, can preserve her own Saint Graph even without a Master.
For Protea, the Master is not 『a necessary keystone to bound her / a source of mana supply』, but just 『the one who summoned her』.
In the case that a Master succeeded in summoning her in a Holy Grail War, the 『duty to supply the Servant with mana』 would disappear for that Master.
It depends on the Master whether they see it as an advantage or as a predicament.

### Territory Creation: EX

She possesses an abnormal Territory Creation skill.
Protea herself, who keeps hypertrophying her own Saint Graph, is a Temple ——— synonymous with a territory.

### High-Servant: EX

Has the essence of Titania (Titan), Airavata, and Tiamat.
Protea was made with the essence of a Great Earth Mother, but her true nature… The Cerebral Corpus sleeping in the interior of her Saint Graph, is said to have the figure of a childish little girl.

### Divine Core of the Goddess: A

A skill that represents that one is a perfected goddess since birth.
It has the effect of preserving the absoluteness of mind and body.
It mitigates most mental interference / no persuasion would change her perception,
and the body doesn’t grow / no magecraft can make her body human-sized.
