A cool-headed young man, a little lacking in humanity.
Silent, emotionless and expressionless. All the right ingredients to ruin a conversation.
His no-nonsense attitude makes people describe him as “like a robot”, but it would be a lot more accurate to describe him as a game animal doing everything it can to survive. The simple beauty of the wild.
Marisbilly considered him the one with the highest Rayshift aptitude of all and his skills were also in the top tier among the Masters gathered by Chaldea, but due to his unsociable personality, he was given the role of supporting from the shadows instead of being the team leader.
Although the other team members acknowledge his abilities, his complete lack of cooperativeness made Wodime a preferable choice for the leader position.
