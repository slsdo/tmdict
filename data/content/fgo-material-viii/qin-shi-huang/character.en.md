### Personality

While they may be arrogant, they are a person who likes looking after others so they won’t overlook the plight of others. At their core, they are someone with good intentions, but since what they consider good is to be “managed under the protection of the Qin dynasty”, concerning the result, none could think of it as anything but an unwelcome favor.
Brimming with a spirit of inquiry, they are interested in everything and would poke their head into things, but due to the inquisitiveness they possessed from the start based on the conclusion that “as expected, the Qin empire is number one”, they are always assuming a condescending attitude. In the end, it is a spirit of inquiry from the standpoint of conducting a prior investigation for the sake of a future conquest.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Since they are a statesman worried about the “fate of the world of man” in every time axis, if the world were to be on the verge of a crisis, they’d proactively involve themselves in it. Although they have their doubts about the human civilization that is a compiled phenomenon where “the people confront fate without relying on a sole absolute being”, they understand that such a thing has more promise than their rule that came to end due to the pruning phenomenon, and plan to calmly ascertain the conclusion. The Master who demonstrated their strength to fight on in the past to Qin Shi Huang could be considered their sole “rival as a human”, and the Emperor is always observing them to measure their true worth.

### Dialogue Examples

“Aptly, We are the Emperor. The one who rules over all like the heavens do. Therefore, We’ll allow the masses to have an audience with Us. Like the Sun that shines on all the lands without discrimination, without exception, We will bestow the honor upon the masses to admire us.”
“Those with wisdom have doubts. Trapped in obstructive thoughts, they begin to compare themselves to others and, beyond their control, they develop a grudge against the world. My permanent paradise would only come to be if we were to abolish that unsightly ego of an individual. Therefore, ignorance is what will let the people live peacefully and healthily.”
“Human relations are the source of all conflict. Therefore it is unnecessary for a human to have equals. We shall lead the masses with love, as the only human. The masses need only to take a peaceful repose on the lands with all their needs for food, mating, and sleep satisfied.”
(Usually after making a boastful speech) “In other words, Us!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The founder who, for the first time in China which boasts an eternal history, accomplished the unification of the country, and established himself as the emperor. He accomplished many great feats that would become the foundation for China’s later prosperity such as centralizing power through a county and prefecture system, creating a consolidated currency and measuring unit, and the establishment of a transportation network; but at the same time, he was also known for his severe oppression of thoughts such as the burning of books and burying of scholars. In his later years, in a wish for gaining immortality, he searched for the mysteries of the realm of immortals and attempted to search throughout all of China, but he died without realizing his wish.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In the Lostbelt, Qin Shi Huang was a transcendental existence who lived for 2200 years with a mechanical body and promptly achieved the feat of unifying the world.
He was a wise ruler who considered the matters of the populace carefully, but didn’t view them as people.
In the first place, his definition of a human being was “someone who is responsible for themselves and the future of the world” and in the Qin Empire governed by Qin Shi Huang, the only existence who could be described as such was the emperor alone. The human race that entrusted all dominion to the administrator wasn’t made up of “people similar to humans”; Qin Shi Huang cared for them as mere livestock and pets that the emperor was held accountable for.
They were a lonely and self-centered existence, but since they were a person who’s overcome the frailty of human nature that serves as a source for selfishness and malice, their nature wasn’t distorted by their circumstances. As a person with a wise and rational character, he was someone you could even exchange words with. …However, not under the common understanding that both parties were humans.
Therefore, he was very shocked by “the world where every citizen can be human”, namely, the possibility for democracy, described by the visitor who appeared from the compiled phenomenon.
