When I heard of the character, at first I was going to draw him as a standard adult male, but then I saw that his gender was listed as unknown on the order sheet which made me think of the last bosses who look like children that appear in works intended for kids, but in the end, I went with an adult male similar in design to Kars-sama and Harara-sama{{n1}} …and so he gained his current form which I wanted to resemble the classic beauties drawn by Tezuka Osamu and Go Nagai. Since the clothes of the emperor had the concept of a microcosmos, I forcibly shoved it in, but I thought it would be nice if it exhibited the eerieness of a Rorschach test where you would see something different depending on how you looked at it.
