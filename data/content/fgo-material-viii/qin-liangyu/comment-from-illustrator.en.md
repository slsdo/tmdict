I believe that Qin Liangyu was designed around the start of FGO’s service, but first of all, since she is a Lancer in Fate, I remember starting her design… by deciding on full-body tights for her. Yeah. Tights were not mandatory. There was a plan and the like that emphasized a figure typical of a military woman with a tall stature, but eventually, I settled down in a recommended design that emphasized cuteness. (Shima Drill)
