### Personality

Gentle and reserved, Qin Liangyu has both a hard and soft attitude towards soldiers; the type of person who is trusted by those above her as well as those below her. “Beauty” is a criterion missing in her self-assessment, regarding only whether or not she is carrying out her work properly as important. Because of that, she can also be embarrassed and perplexed if the spotlight is suddenly on her.

### Attitude towards Master

Qin Liangyu recognizes her Master as the Master, properly establishing a hierarchical relationship between them. If it is a dangerous place, she will emerge before her Master and protect them, if it is a safe place, she will be standing behind them, and if she is requested for her opinion from them, she will respond with a pertinent reply. Even if she is in love with her Master, she will not think of things such as “I want to make them her own”, instead being devotedly moderate in that it is fine for her if she just gives them a smile. It is common for her to recognize her Master as a target that she should protect and be a patron to. Saying that specifically, she will become their caretaker.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’ll do it!{{n1}}… Eh, ah, that’s wrong, you’ve got the wrong idea! Jeez, no waaay…”
“I may be trifling and incompetent, but to this trust in me, I will devote everything I have! Here… is a Song of Selflessness and Loyalty! Here I come!”
“… Hehe, it’s an unavoidable thing, even if I question it, huh? Only the Emperor… possess the answer to that, and ultimately, I too————will continue to take up a spear in my hands, for the sake of subduing rebellions————”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The “Twenty-Four Histories” is famous as a traditional history book of China. In the “History of Ming”, a history among those histories where it has high fame, there is Qin Liangyu, who is remembered as the sole “female military commander” within that series.

Originally a native of a minority group, Qin Liangyu became the wife of a man named Ma Qiancheng, who governed a region named Zhong Prefecture, and she served in the subjugation of a certain rebellion together with her husband. Afterwards, she became a general by succeeding her husband’s position after he died in prison, who was imprisoned for a civil action-related matter, and she repelled the bandits many times, but at some point in time, four of the castles in the region she governed were stolen from her by bandits.

Qin Liangyu, who was summoned to the capital, was prepared for death, but she was instead presented with a reward and four poems by the Emperor, before she was ordered to recapture the four castles she lost.

Qin Liangyu was inspired by the treatment given to her, and she worked well from then onwards. She remained the same even after the downfall of the Ming Dynasty, serving the Southern Ming Dynasty and its exiled government, and she continued to wage war until she died. It was told that she died a peaceful death due to infirmity at the age of 74-years-old.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

To speak of Qin Liangyu in a few words, an older sister of firm character who can become reliable for others. She recognizes the Master as a younger brother/sister that must be protected. She will wake up in the morning earlier than anyone else and wait for the Master to wake up, manage their schedule, and go to bed in the night after she waits for her Master to fall asleep.

It is strange that even though Qin Liangyu is not particularly forced to do this, it seems she will settle down into such a role. An older sister who will be in high spirits and work for the sake of the Human Order. Furthermore, she likes pandas.

Qin Liangyu appeared as an enemy Servant in a Lostbelt{{n2}}. She dyed her hands in blood while building up an everlasting peace, but…

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Qin Liangyu often says やります and 殺ります, both pronounced as ‘yarimasu’. The first can mean to do something, while the second means to kill someone/do someone in. This is why in her first speech example, she was correcting herself and trying to dispel any misunderstandings on what she just said.
2. {{note2}} Qin Liangyu actually appeared as a living human in the Lostbelt, not as a Servant.
