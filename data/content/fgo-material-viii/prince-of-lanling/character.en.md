### Personality

He is usually courteous and modest, yet dauntless and brave in front of his enemies.
He is kind to his troops, and loyal to his lord.
He is truly a great general as if out of a fantastic story.
He does not boast about his beauty, but rather finds it unpleasant. However he knows he would be faced with backlash if he were to voice his opinion on it, so he tends not to tell others about it.

### Attitude towards Master

He respects proper etiquette and takes an attitude of keeping himself below his Master.
However when he feels they are doing something he feels is wrong, he will start acting somewhat timidly and suspicious until he asks them “is this really ok to do this?”.
Maybe it was because he spent too long working under a foolish lord, but it seems like giving good advice has become a bit of a trauma for him.
As he deepens his bonds with his Master, he will surely overcome this trauma.

### Dialogue Examples

“Saber-class Servant. Prince of Lanling. I have answered your summons. I’m sure you must find it rude that I arrive wearing a mask, but please forgive me…”
“Master, I must wonder how well I can repay all the affection and kindness you have shown me. If it’s for your sake, not even fire, ice or poison would be obstacles to me.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Lanling’s tragic fate and beauty that put him in the history books make him one of the most popular generals of China.
It is even said that his beauty was such that he had to wear a mask in battle as to not cause his own men to falter due to being enchanted by him.

He was also possessed unparalleled skill as a general, as it is said he once broke through an enemy siege of 10,000 soldiers with only 500 of his own, and managed to protect the city of Luoyang.

Unfortunately for him, the Northern Qi dynasty which he served was already showing signs of heading towards ruin, and not only that but it was none other but the foolish emperor who appeared deeply envious of Lanling’s popularity.

As Lanling kept bravely going into battle and earning more achievements, the emperor grew more annoyed with him and eventually wished for his death and sent him some poison.

Shortly after Lanling’s death, Northern Qi quickly headed towards its doom.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Beautiful, modest and brave. He is such a perfect and hard to find person to have as a subordinate…But due to bad experiences with the lord he served in the past, he has developed a bit of distrust towards his Master.

Once their bond deepens, he will begin opening up and even give advice, but…
If they can’t deepen their bond, he will forever keep distance from his Master.

Moreover, there are still times when the words he directs towards his Master go in a reckless and wild direction (refer to his Valentine’s scene).

### General Armaments

Long sword and horse. (He’s the kind of Saber who still rides a horse)

### Connections with Characters

#### Xiang Yu / Lu Bu:

…I see, so these are our China’s unparalleled warriors…Robots…I see, I see…

#### Penthesilea

We usually make small talk about masks.
The fact she doesn’t seem interested in me makes it really easy to get along with her. (the same probably goes for her)

#### Consort Yu

I would’ve never imagined we could meet again as Servants, and am deeply moved.
She proudly said I could rely on her whenever I needed advice, but…
I can’t help but be constantly worried about her, so whenever I hear a loud noise I rush to see if she’s fine.

#### Jing Ke

She has a sloppy way of walking, but also a silent way of killing and a tendency to get terribly drunk.
She would be truly beautiful if she acted more properly, so I can’t help but be troubled when she keeps drinking herself unconscious.

#### Diarmuid

What? You can’t seal your beauty spot’s curse even if you wear a mask? I-I’m so sorry…

#### Blackbeard

Why is it that I can suddenly hear background music playing when I do stuff sometimes…?
(Hint: It’s background music used for romantic events with special CGs.)
