March of the Prince of Lanling.
This is a song said to have created by the soldiers who praised the masked Lanling’s battles.
This song was brought to Japan as Japanese court music during the era of the Tang dynasty, and it is still performed to this day.
This song which exalts Lanling’s beauty and bravery causes his allies’ morale to rise sharply, while making his enemies falter.
Also, since Lanling also participates in singing with his beautiful voice and face, the enemies become struck with tremendous pressure and fear, yet are unable to take their eyes off his beauty.
