A mage recruited as the team’s main fighter.
He’s normally a talkative and sociable young man, but when he gets serious, he turns into a malicious and ferocious serial killer.
He may look thuggish at first glance, but he’s an understanding gentleman when you actually talk to him.
He likes to brag about his very sociable and philanthropic personality.
