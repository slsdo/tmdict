Kama Sammohana.
The original Noble Phantasm of the god of love Kama.
The arrow of flowers held by Kama, called Sammohana.
It has the effect of evoking feelings of love in those it pierces.
 
Due to my trauma, I’m not too keen on using her Noble Phantasm for the sake of others in general.
Currently, I’m of the opinion that sticking your nose into the love affairs of others is just foolish.
Like I’d care about love consultations. Bastards who’d force me to act like a cupid and shoot arrows should just drop dead. On the contrary, getting in the way of people who squeal and giggle about love and affection would be extremely entertaining, wouldn’t it…saying so, Kama has turned into an “evil god of love” in defiance.

### Saṃsāra Kama: Passion Burns, For Love Exists

Saṃsāra Kama.
The other form of the arrow of flowers, Sammohana.

In a state where her nature as “The Incorporeal One” and “The Seducer” strongly manifests, the body she lost itself will be interpreted as the arrow of love.

It is a depraved love that is akin to the endless cycle of reincarnation.

There exist countless episodes of reincarnation and rebirth for Kama, so she also possesses the title of Saṃsāra​ Guru (master of the cycle of reincarnation).
