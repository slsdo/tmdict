### Magic Resistance: A

Invalidates magecraft of A-Rank or below.
Mages of the modern era are unable to wound her with magecraft.

### Independent Manifestation: C

A special Skill. The ultra-superior version of Independent Action. The corruption of love can appear anywhere.
As a Servant, Kama has basically zero motivation so this skill is in a state of being sealed at her depths, but the effects of “instant death and mental debuff resistance” can be displayed even like this.

### Divine Core of the God of Love: B

A Skill that representing her being a perfected god of love from birth. The god of love version of the “Divine Core of the Goddess” skill.

It has the effect of maintaining the absoluteness of the mind and the body. It mitigates almost all mental interference, prevents the body from growth, and it prevents the figure from changing no matter how many calories are intaken.

…On the other hand, as a god of love, it is also endowed with the special characteristic of “being able to change into the form necessary for the act of loving”; at the end of the day, “transforming as one pleases” is also something that symbolizes a great degree of freedom when it comes to one’s flesh and outward appearance. A skill that every woman would covet.

However, under the present circumstances, it is not possible to change the figure to an extent that would leap past the vessel’s framework. If it’s just the gender, then perhaps…?

It is a composite skill that also includes the Divinity skill.

The rank is B because she is a Pseudo-Servant inhabiting a vessel.

### Riding: A

With the exception of phantasmal and divine beasts, she can control any steed or vehicle as she pleases.
Kama’s mount is said to be a parrot.
