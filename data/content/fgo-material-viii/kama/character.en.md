### Personality

A divine spirit who took an interest in the dark parts of her vessel’s personality and integrated with them.
Being taken as both the god of love and the demon king of depravity, Kama/Mara only possessed an authority of the “directivity that corrupts humans”.
Her form is one that connects that directivity with the depressed sense of self, personality, and interests and preferences that make up one facet of the young girl used as her vessel.
Due to this, her Divine Spirit-ness is somewhat weaker compared to someone like Ishtar, which allows her to take on a stance of “refusing to work” that would go against the meaning of her existence as a god, to some extent.

A young girl full of a bitter and decadent sense of fatigue.
A demonic woman who won’t acknowledge the insistence and rights of a partner who doesn’t assert himself, and is lewd, greedy and ruthless while being chaste, and would become as brutal as possible for the sake of love.

Basically, she hates, looks down on and mocks everyone (humans), but at the same time this also means that “she pays mind to everyone”.
As a god of love, Kama’s forte is “being able to love anyone no matter what they are like”.
This goddess who became Kama/Mara has a truly annoying personality of “hating everyone other than herself” despite “loving everyone but herself”.

<>

She loves making humans who seem happy miserable.
She also loves seeing miserable humans becoming even more miserable.
She loves turning the love-life of others into a mess.
She really, really loves sadistic methods such as strangling someone’s neck with silk floss.
And so, she is an ideal evil boss heroine, however, despite her powerful authority, she’s a pessimist who finds most things a pain in the ass so her actions seem subdued. She’s clumsy in some way.

Regardless of how hard they try to persuade her with fervent speeches, she’d just go “Yes, yes. It’s so nice that you’re enjoying yourself. I’m the worst though.” and won’t even acknowledge the other person. She won’t accept their words either. Basically, she’s a boss heroine that is impossible to persuade.

…However, in truth, she is extremely weak-willed.
She wants to be loved so all of her pessimism and negativity are ways to get attention.
She’s a cunning goddess who’d behave strangely like getting red in the face when pressed with a pushy attitude.
Because of this annoying “attribute of secretly wanting to be loved”, she is a heavy goddess who’ll fully devote herself to the partner that opens his heart to her and will keep expecting things from him.
“There are black holes even in the universe, no?” was the comment from the goddess of Venus.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She has no particular wish for the Holy Grail, but she thinks it would be nice to harass Parvati through it.
She is sick of being used as an intermediary for unrequited loves and convenient love-lives
“Yeah, yeah, everything is my (Kama’s) fault, all of it.”
Tired of playing such a role, currently, Kama has taken on a cynical attitude.

Something like a Master is nothing but a plaything for her.
Basically, she is observing their unsightly life with a cold look.
Scorn, exasperation, and boredom.
All of these are mixed into the look she gives the Master as if they were a pig slated to be shipped off by tomorrow.

However, this mustn’t cause you to despair.
Kama wouldn’t even look at those she has no interest in to begin with.
Her gazing at the Master (as if they were a pig), are actually because of things such as admiration and expectations.
Just what kind of hopeless failure is this Master and how much will seeing their laughable and pitiful state entertain her?
How long will they stay by her side without coming to hate her?
Kama’s holding such hopes without being aware of it at all.
If you were to patiently go along with this goddess’ bad taste and insensitivity, one day, her good nature buried deep within all that wickedness would────
You might come in contact with the heart of a shy but sincere maiden slumbering within the young girl used as her vessel.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am Kama. The god of love. …Sigh. Needless to say, it is just the worst. Love is something that would disappear like a māyā{{n1}} if you were to just blow on it. To be ruling over something like that, there should be a limit to futility too.”

“Truly shallow, aren’t they…even though love is not as nice as they think.
If you make even the smallest mistake, both you and your partner will be ruined, you know…? Well, that’s quite entertaining in itself. (Smiles scornfully)I mean, look, won’t dealing with hazardous materials make one’s heart race?”

“…Sigh. Is it okay if I ask one thing of you, Master-san? Please, tell the Servants here to not come for advice about love to me. If it turns annoying I’ll want to kill them all.”

“Parvati…so you were here too. Shoo shoo. Aah, if you want to attract your husband’s attention, I’ll lend you this arrow so be my guest and have a go at it. Even if you meet a terrible fate, as long as you have love, you’ll be able to endure it, won’t you?”

“I wonder just how much the Holy Grail has caused the life of this young girl I and Parvati possessed to go off the rails. …This child is a victim too. Just like me.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Kama is the god of love in Hinduism. kama means “love”.
A handsome man who rides a parrot holding a bow made of sugarcane and five flower arrows.
Eros (Cupid) would be his Greek counterpart.
Those shot by his arrows would fall in love.

Kama’s most famous episode is about Parvati and Shiva.
The gods wanted Parvati and Shiva to make a child, but Shiva was in the middle of his ascetic meditation and had absolutely no interest in Parvati.
And so, the gods (or just Parvati) sent in Kama and forced him to shoot the meditating Shiva with the arrow of love.
It is said that Shiva was enraged and, opening his third eye, burned Kama to ashes.
This is the origin of Kama’s other name, “The Incorporeal One (Ananga)”.

In addition, Kama is viewed as the same as the incarnation of worldly desires, the demon Mara. The origin of the word Mara is “one that kills” and is translated as “demon”, “obstacle to Buddhist practices” and “demon king”.
In Buddhism, it is the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven that resides in the sixth heaven of the six heavens of the desire realm, the heaven of controlling others’ emanations.
When the Gautama Buddha was reaching enlightenment, Mara tried to hinder that in various ways.
It sent three beautiful girls to him (they were all Mara transformed), threw a plate of fire at him, rained stones and weapons on him, assailed him with monsters, heavy rain, and wind……
However, the Gautama Buddha turned the plate of fire and weapons into flowers and his enlightenment couldn’t be obstructed.
Having hindered Shiva, Kama has been established as Mara who obstructed the Gautama Buddha and her role as “one who stands in the way of the practitioners of Buddhism” has been fixed.
One could even call Kama/Mara the god who represents the good and bad sides of the concept known as love.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The lazy “evil goddess of love”.
In the past, when she shot Shiva with her arrow for Parvati’s sake, it turned into an outrageous situation.
She didn’t do anything bad, but she was turned into ashes and killed.
“How ridiculous…I am sick of working for the sake of others’ affections and love.” is what she currently thinks.
That’s why, when it comes to her duty as a god of love, she’s doing what’s all the rage these days: she’s boycotting it.

Basically, she’s apathetic, always bored, uninterested and sick of everything.
However, contrary to that, once she finds something that looks “somewhat interesting”, she’ll make her move with an unpleasant smile on her face.
For the most part, it will turn into something that brings trouble to others (mostly Parvati).

The Kama who has a connection to the “Tokugawa Kaiten Labyrinth: Ooku” holds a special significance when it comes to the nature of “The Incorporeal One”.
Shiva is the one who administers the “destruction of the universe”.
Kama, who directly took on the power of the third eye that is an “existence that burns up the universe”, turned into ashes=nothing=the incorporeal one, in a paradoxical manner, gained the qualifications to become the universe. It is a conceptual assimilation with that infinite domain, due to having one’s form turned into the same kind of nothingness/void by a “power like that”. In short, as “The Incorporeal One”, Kama has become tied to the concept of the universe.
By acquiring that authority, as the “victim”, Kama has become one that “brings suffering” to all.
At any rate, she’s the universe. Her screams of anguish, her rage, her envy, her discontent, they all reach every substance in this world.
By burning her own body, Kama’s limbs turn to ether lumps and she becomes “Shiva’s Universe” itself.
Kama in that state would turn into a phenomenon that transcends the limits of a Divine Spirit, a threat to humanity, and an unhindered calamity.

### General Armaments

Bow and arrow
Vajra
In hindu mythology, it is a weapon of Indra, but it is said that Kama got in the way of Shiva’s meditation on the orders of Indra. It is probably an indirect criticism of that.

### Connections with Characters

#### Shiva

It’s impossible, for real.

#### Parvati

…So instead, she’ll make harassing this woman my purpose in life.
However, cornering the divine wife of Shiva in argument completely is quite difficult and it would often turn out to be a waste of effort.
They say you can often witness Kama being the one to receive damage instead and gnash her teeth in frustration.

#### Ganesha / Ashwathama

She refuses to deal with those affiliated with Shiva. Using them as a target of harassment would be fine.

#### Rama

She is also somewhat involved with Krishna, because of a previous reincarnation, but the Pseudo-Servant Kama isn’t aware of that.{{n2}}

#### Sesshouin Kiara

I do not know her. That’s right, I do not know her so up till this point and even afterwards, I’ll have nothing to do with her. I won’t involve myself with her. …I said I won’t! I won’t!

#### BB / Sakura Five

Though we have similar faces, the rules are different…or rather, we’d be glitches to each other should we stay in the same place. Seriously, what’s with this vessel of mine?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Māyā means illusion.
2. {{note2}} Apparently, Kama reincarnated as Krishna's son at some point.
