At first, getting an ambitious design of “A male Indian god, using a Sakura around junior high school student age as his base, who’s a downer, but make it so it doesn’t head into Dark Sakura territory…” made me go “What am I supposed to do with this!” (laughs). And then, Takeuchi-san proposed a greedy three-stage growth set. Thank you very much for accepting my bold approach of making the third ascension all sparkly (she’s a god after all), putting a universe inside her hair (she’s a god after all), and having her limbs be burning (she got burned after all). Having the Indian lotus in her third ascension’s background reflected in her Noble Phantasm animation made me really happy. I am very touched that everyone loves her so much even though she’s supposed to be the god who does the loving herself. (ReDrop)
