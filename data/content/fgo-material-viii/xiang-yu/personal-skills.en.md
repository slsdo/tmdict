### Future Prediction: A

He has the ability to gain the first hit on every enemy with his high-speed operating simulation.

### Tactical Body: B

His body deviated from human lifeforms as he performed frequent tune-ups as a result of him being a decisive weapon for the Eternal Qin Empire. Xiang Yu in Pan-Human History had attained this form, but this 『possible appearance』 could be accepted as his glory days as the summoning is due to his binded link in the Lostbelt.

### Supreme Ruler’s Art of War: A

He is feared as the God of Military Arts because he is the incarnation of his anecdote and is misunderstood by humans while as a combat weapon. In a sense, this Skill could be similar to 『Innocent Monster.』
