With his wild legend as is, I designed him as a being that transendended the art of war. At the beginning he felt more or less human, but as I modified him further, he began to take on more and more grotesque features. Itâ€™s as if he was being eroded gradually, and I enjoy every minute of it. I packed everything into drawing his final ascension. (danciao)
