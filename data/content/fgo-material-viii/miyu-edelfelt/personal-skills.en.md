### Pleasant-Type Mystic Code (Little Sister): A

The little sister of the Weird-stick.
Compared to the enthusiastic older sister, she’s calmed and rational.
But after all, she’s a man-made Nature Elemental.
The obligation to manipulate the Master and induce fun and weird situations hasn’t changed much.
Furthermore, she has the tendency to make the costume of her contractor have more exposure in comparison to her older sister for some reason.

### Willpower of the Little Girl: B

Miyu’s strength of will has been sublimated into a skill.
Her noble determination won’t be shaken by half-hearted things, and enables Battle Continuation even if she receives a lethal wound.
This isn’t something congenital, but a spirituality acquired by going through several experiences.
But perhaps her obstinacy may be similar to her old brother’s.

### Wish of the God Child: EX

A skill that minimally releases the property that indiscriminately realizes the wishes of oneself and others.
Her wish will surely reach the heavens.

### Hypnotic Radio Waves: A

A mysterious feature built in Sapphire.
Spreads radio waves with a powerful hypnotic effect, and overwrites the memories of the humans in the surroundings.
If used for evil it could ruin a country, but unlike Ruby she doesn’t make use of it for fun, so please rest assured.
Furthermore, maybe because it burdens the brain, the IQ of the hypnotized humans decreases by 1.
