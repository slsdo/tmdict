Taking notes from Illya, the first and second Ascensions are her usual looks. The third Ascension is the form of the if of「What if she became a magical girl while retaining the power of the God Child……」. Sapphire reads the mood and changes as well. For Miyu the power of the God Child is like a curse from a certain lineage, but on the other hand there’s the aspect that she was able to meet her old brother and Illya because she had that power. The Miyu who naturally uses the power of the God Child, understanding and accepting it, is a form I couldn’t draw in the original story so I feel very happy to have been able to introduce it in FGO. Her lines also separate her feelings as the God Child and those as Miyu individually. (Hiroyama Hiroshi)
