### Personality

Because she was raised in a state almost like confinement since she was born until now, she’s ignorant of the ways of the world.
Nonetheless she’s likely to get overly theoretical since she has knowledge from books, and she often reacts in ways that slightly deviate from common sense.
She has knowledge of Physics and Mathematics at university level, but on the other hand her communication skills may be lower than a kindergartener’s.
In everyday life and in battle, she favors rationality.
Gáe Bolg 5 seconds after the encounter.
She has an extraordinarily deep affection towards Illya, the first friend she made, and the lily flowers often bloom in profusion.{{n1}}
It feels like she puts all sorts of weight in the definition of the relationship of 『friends』, but thinking about the environment in which she was raised it’s unavoidable.
It seems the view of friends her old brother spoke of had some influence, but well.
Chloe apparently is a rival-like existence that scrambles for Illya.

### Attitude towards Master

She understands her role in Chaldea, and accepts it with composure.
Of course, she’s used to being instructed on her actions by humans of an upper position.
She won’t doubt about using her power for the sake of people, for Master’s sake.
She sees the Master as a boss. She pays respect to their achievements, not to their character.
If the bonds are deepened, she will eventually notice that the Master’s spirituality is close to that of Illya.
But if Master tries to meddle with Illya, there will be no mercy.

### Dialogue Examples

「People…… can’t fly」

「Today, right here, I’ll put an end to the battle!」

「My only friend is Illya. Don’t get close to Illya anymore」

「…… Wishing to a star. If only one thing could be granted ——— I want to be real siblings with Shirō-san」

### Character Image

A kid born in the old family that has taken roots in Fuyuki from the Tenshō era, the Sakadzuki family.
She has the paranormal property to grant the wishes of people.
The Sakadzuki family was destroyed in the disaster that happened in Fuyuki, and Miyu was found by a certain father and his son.
After that, there was the equivalent in comic of about 2 volumes of this and that, and she became a magical girl like Illya in a different world.
In terms of mana quantity, she’s above the weakened Illya for no apparent reason.
She is good at the relatively muscle-headed style of quick movement and high-output blasts.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She appears in the collaboration event 『Magical Girl Cruise ~ Prisma Codes ~ Re-install』.
She became a long-awaited playable character in the re-run.
She obviously hopes to be in the same room as Illya at Chaldea.
The 3, counting Chloe, seem to have fun chattering as usual.

### General Armaments

She’s equipped with the Kaleidostick 『Pleasant-type Mystic Code Magical Sapphire』.
Besides mana bullets of high-density mana shot from the stick, slashes with mana thinly stretched in the form of a blade (melee attacks are possible too), high-power blasts and such can be freely used depending on the situation.
Fundamentally the output of each shot is greater than Illya’s.
Also, unlike Illya, who can fly, she moves making footing in the air with mana.
She can’t move flexibly, but is able of quick linear maneuvers.

### Connections with Characters

#### Illyasviel von Einzbern

If I’m with Illya, I can face any hardship.
If I’m with Illya, every food is delicious.
If I’m with Illya, I can always sleep soundly.
If I’m with Illya, baths are fun.
If I’m with Illya…….

#### Chloe von Einzbern

I think that er… going kissy-kissy regardless of the situation is improper.
Even Illya’s reputation may fall so I’d like you to restrain yourself.
Chloe: 「Then I’ll suck from Miyu instead」
Miyu: 「Huh?」

#### EMIYA

I can’t put it in words properly.
That’s why, please let me just say this once.
——— Thank you.
For helping Onii-chan.
