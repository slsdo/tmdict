Wish Upon a Star.
Temporarily controls the nature of the God Child that indiscriminately grants the wishes of people, and realizes desires for a limited time.
Since it’s a Noble Phantasm that only focuses on the Master’s wish of 『wanting to protect Human Order』, a relationship of mutual trust becomes more important than anything else.
The nature of the God Child was supposedly lost due to the wish of Miyu herself, but the reason why it was registered in her Saint Graph was because she’s in 『a form that grew while retaining the nature of the God Child』.
Maybe because the body is different, maybe because the land is different, the reason is unknown but it doesn’t seem to be an omnipotent wish-granting device like the original.

That moonless night in which she became Emiya Miyu.
Her old brother said that her modest thoughts hidden inside would be wished not upon the moon but upon the stars.
That landscape, those thoughts, those words became her Noble Phantasm.
The moon that shines above the earth and bundles wishes throws its light to the summit of the dark sky.
