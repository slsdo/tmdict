I wanted to draw her with more arms!!!! I thought Jinako’s design already had some Ganesha elements from the start (like her belly) so I made a really legit Ganesha design without having to change much from the base. Honestly, I had way too much fun drawing her belly, so I made it a little too big… I’m sorry… The statue opens by sliding the front side to the sides. (Wada Arco)
