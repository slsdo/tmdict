Unusable outside of special circumstances.
Ganesha means master of retainers and Vighneshvara is Ganesha’s other name meaning god of obstacles.
By taking his property as the Remover of Obstacles to the purest level, she can manifest an absolutely inviolable force field.
If used offensively, its absolute might can shove away any obstacle standing before her.
And of course, defensively, she can use it as a perfect shield to block any attack (obstacle) from others.
