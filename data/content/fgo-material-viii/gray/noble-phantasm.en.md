Rhongomyniad.
The holy spear.
The holy spear is the anchor that secures the front and reverse sides of the world, but the spear wielded by Gray is but a mere shadow of it.
However, since even a shadow of the holy spear would normally be too much for a human like Gray to handle, it is usually sealed inside Add, and only released when necessary. The fact Add can transform into many different weapons is also because of the power contained within the spear.

Even when the holy spear’s power has been sealed behind the two barriers of Add and the 13 restrictions, it still has not lost it’s radiance.
