### Territory Creation: A

As a mage, he can create a “workshop”, a territory advantageous to him.
Because he possesses an A-rank skill, it is also possible for him to create a “temple” which surpasses a “workshop”.
Naturally, such a place is nothing but a consultation room, a treatment room, or an operating room for the sake of medical practice to him.

### Item Construction: EX

Although he can only create items related to medicine, the items he creates are of extremely high quality. These items are, in most cases, more or less effective on his target injuries or diseases. However, the same cannot be guaranteed for everything else.

### Divinity: A

He (grudgingly) possesses high divinity as a son of Apollo.
