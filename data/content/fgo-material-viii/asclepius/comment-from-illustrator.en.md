“A gloomy introvert who, at a closer glance, is actually a beauty but doesn’t give off that vibe.” “A mad doctor.” With these orders, I drew his First Ascension design. I incorporated many elements of his anecdotes into it.

In my first draft, I modified his 1st Ascension costume to be more combative for his 2nd Ascension, and designed his 3rd Ascension with the theme “god of medicine” and the same color scheme as his current design. But Takeuchi-san suggested an operating gown for his 2nd Ascension and to also give him longer sleeves for his 3rd Ascension since his pampered sleeves/amaenbo-sode is his charm point, so that’s how his current designs were finalized.

For someone who seeks the advancement of medicine, I think his 2nd Ascension is perfect for him. Above all, it warms my heart to find out that his long sleeves are actually called “pampered sleeves/amaenbo-sode” (lol). (Teita)
