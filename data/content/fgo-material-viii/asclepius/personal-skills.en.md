### God of Medicine: EX

A skill that proves his existence as the founder of the concept of “medical care”, which has been handed down until present times, and as the god of medicine.

In one myth version, the first to use herbs for treatment was Chiron, but the one who studied and developed that knowledge and the first to practice clinical medicine was Asclepius.

### Son of Apollo: A

A skill that proves his lineage to the Greek god Apollo. Apollo is the god of many fields such as archery, performing arts, prophecies, and the sun. He is also the god of plagues as well as healing, a manifestation of duality.
Asclepius would very much want to forget about this skill. However, if there are patients he can only save through the power of this blood… It’s likely that, while clicking his tongue, he will not hesitate to make use of this power.

### Serpent Bearer / Ophiuchus: B

He employs a serpent which is a symbol of immortality and also used in medical care.
In Ancient Greece, serpents were regarded as sacred messengers of the gods.
Asclepius, killed by a thunderbolt thrown by Zeus as punishment for resurrecting the dead, became the constellation Ophiuchus/Serpent Bearer after death—something he may or may not have wished for.
“The Rod of Asclepius” has a serpent wrapped around it and is still used as a symbol of medicine today.
