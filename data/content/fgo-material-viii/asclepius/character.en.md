### Personality

A mad doctor who is only interested in advancing medicine. Conversely, he won’t give a damn about bothering others for the sake of his goal. (The reason for his goal is rooted in his love for humanity, his desire “to leave exceptional medicine for posterity” － something he himself has forgotten.)

He is typically a calm and quiet man. He won’t interact with others by choice except for medical reasons. Neither is he interested in others.

He considers himself an excellent doctor which is an absolute assessment rather than a relative assessment. He neither needlessly scorns nor looks down on others. But if the need arises, he would nonchalantly say, “I am far better than you. That’s a given.” And even if his words anger the other person, he would only add, “Why? It is a fact that I am better,” puzzled.

Although he is a quiet person, that doesn’t mean he has a lot of patience. He would suddenly snap when he’s furious. A mad doctor indeed.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

My wish to the Grail is, of course, “to further advance medicine”.
For the time being, how about the mass-production of the true resurrection medicine?

I treat my Master as a patron.
Bring me patients with all sorts of medical cases. Let me do research and experiments as I please.
In exchange, I’ll be sure to treat them—something like that.

If he were to be summoned in a regular Holy Grail War by a Master skilled in combat, he would probably tell his Master, “Go, Master. I’ll treat you if you get injured,” and earnestly provide medical support. That said, there’s also a chance that he would frown and tell his Master, “Why did you come back unscathed? I need you to get pleasantly and unusually injured.” In short, he’s still the same old Asclepius who sailed as an Argo crew.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am a doctor. Bring patients to me if there are any. The more severe the symptoms, the better… What? You’re coming down with a cold? Go shove a leek into your ass and sleep.”

“Fuha, FUHAHAHA! God of the Underworld, behold! Your role here is over. Man has conquered death! [Emulated Medicine - The Grief of the Obsolete Underworld (Resurrection Fraught Hades)]!”

“Seeing their faces reminds me of that voyage. I was only aboard as the ship’s doctor, so it didn’t matter to me if it was a fun voyage or not… But well, there was never a dull moment.

“Foolish patient… Behave yourself!”

“Huh. You want to help me? How thoughtful of you. I’ll be the one to perform all the actual treatment of course, but… Let’s see. Learn how to ‘quickly knock unconscious a patient trying to escape’ and ‘safely and securely gag a patient without suffocating them’. What? That doesn’t sound like helping out with treatments at all? What are you talking about? That nurse performs those tasks perfectly, and I don’t even have to say a word to her.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Asclepius was a Greek hero who studied medicine under Chiron and later on became known as the “god of medicine”. He was also a member of the Argonauts led by Jason.

His father is Apollo, one of the twelve Olympians. Apollo became romantically involved with a woman named Coronis and got her pregnant. However, after learning of her infidelity from a crow (which was said to be a lie in some versions), he killed Coronis and turned the crow’s white feathers black in a fit of rage.
Apollo regretted killing Coronis. When she was laid on her funeral pyre, he rescued the child (Asclepius) inside her belly and entrusted him to Chiron, the wise centaur, to raise him.

Asclepius studied medicine and hunting under Chiron and later began showing talent in medicine that surpassed Chiron. By creating a medicine with Gorgon’s blood given to him by Athena, he eventually succeeded in resurrecting the dead.

Unfortunately, this feat posed a problem. If men were to conquer death, the Underworld would lose its value. Sensing an impending crisis, Hades turned to Zeus (he could not harm him himself because Asclepius was a son of Apollo) and Zeus killed Asclepius with a bolt of lighting. In order to appease the enraged Apollo, Zeus deified Asclepius and turned him into the constellation Ophiuchus.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A mad doctor who is only interested in the advancement of medicine.

His medicine encompasses all fields including clinical pharmacology, surgery, as well as medical magecraft, and is highly effective. However, his fundamental goal isn’t “to relieve people of their suffering” or “to be thanked for healing people” but “to advance his skill at medicine”, making him completely different from an ordinary “doctor”.

He would gladly treat novel illnesses that could potentially advance medicine, but would rather not spare a moment to examine mundane illnesses. He often performs unnecessarily experimental and dangerous treatments, the likes that would make another doctor’s blood run cold.

Because of his own genius abilities, his treatments still end up in success. Patients with no medical knowledge would simply exclaim, “I’m healed! This man really is an amazing doctor!” This is the reason behind his reputation.

His one and only goal is “to continue devoting himself to his medicine in order to advance it”. But there’s one thing he can never forgive: Zeus’ cruel treatment of him. Even after manifesting as a Servant, he still bears anger and hatred due to the fact that he was killed by a god.

Why did I have to die?
All I wanted was to devote myself to medicine. I excelled in medicine, that’s all. Why did I have to be killed?
You turned me into a constellation and a god after my death. Do you think I’d forgive you because of that?

The flames of rage directed at that god’s selfish and unfair treatment will never die down.
Having been summoned by the King of the Indian Lostbelt who aimed to reach “a perfect utopia” by eliminating all impurities and embedded a divinity he stole in Asclepius, his rage intensified and went berserk.

Rejecting those who excel for their superiority must not be allowed.
Between things superior and things inferior, those superior ought to remain.
That is the inherent and proper nature of the world—

Adhering to the extreme tenet of this Lostbelt, he began to act as a Servant of the King—a Lōkapāla.

If you ask him, “Why are you so intent on advancing medicine?” his first reaction would be puzzlement.

He himself probably hasn’t realized that the answer is right there. It might have been an initial impulse to him, but he himself has forgotten about it. The reason is so natural to him that he himself has forgotten about it. That’s why he will never say it.

The answer is clear and simple: “I aimed to advance medicine for the future. In other words, for posterity.” His love for humanity.

If you have stayed by his side and spent time with him, the answer might come to you naturally. At the very least, the heroes who sailed with him in the Argo had more or less realized it. Telling him would put him in a sour mood, though. It will bring out his orneriness, and there’s a possibility that he would head in the wrong direction so they made sure not to tell him.

Going deeper, the reason for that initial impulse might be a personal one.
By advancing medicine even further and successfully conquering death, no one will have to meet a pitiful end due to the gods’ foolishness just like my mother…
In other words, his reason might be “(indirect) salvation for the mother I never met, whose death at the hands of the gods left me bereaved”.

### Connections with Characters

#### The thing on top of Paris’ head

…

#### Nightingale

Some of her words and actions do not quite make sense to me, but we are aiming for the same goal… That’s the impression I get. Probably.

Her skills as an assistant are impeccable.

#### Sanson

I can tell that he is hesitant about something, but his skills as an assistant are impeccable.

#### Paracelsus

A man knowledgeable about drugs. I want him to be my source of (what I consider) new pharmaceutical knowledge, but for some reason, that self-proclaimed Galaxy Police keeps shouting, “I smell crime!” and interrupting us even though we’re just talking.

#### Jason / Atalante / Heracles / Argonauts

Familiar faces. I wish they would present all sorts of medical cases to me just like they did in that voyage.

#### Artemis

She doesn’t want to get too deeply involved, yet she can’t seem to completely cut all ties. A goddess who doesn’t know how to keep her distance. I might as well make use of her. She is my **** after all.

Hm…? I sense a goddess using her powers for jamming. I’d rather you help me recreate the resurrection medicine if you’re just going to waste your powers on something so foolish.

#### Orion

A hero who is like a relative, the lover of my ****.
After he died due to that horrible, poor excuse of a god’s scheme, I may have accepted a request and tried to resurrect him.
This man won’t die except under rare circumstances. His robust health reminds me of Heracles, so he’s secretly second in my “Patients I Can Expect to Get Unbelievably and Unusually Injured One Day Ranking”.

#### Okita Souji

She coughs up blood at every opportunity and is practically at death’s door, yet she won’t die… I sense a pleasant, rare disease. Let me examine you.

#### Trojan War Heroes

My children (fought) in the Trojan War? Hmm…

#### Andersen

Unfortunately, I cannot heal your body. That’s because it’s not an illness, but you yourself. Your expression tells me you understand that. Not a case for a doctor, it seems.

#### Underworld-Related Servants

Are you trying to protect death like Hades? How foolish.

#### Hippolytus

One of my very few successful cases. About your mother, you… no, nevermind.

#### Nikola Tesla

Kukuku! How gratifying, how marvelous! You’ve depreciated god’s lightning and claimed it for humans to use! Well done!

…That’s right. This means that one day, “death” will also certainly be—
