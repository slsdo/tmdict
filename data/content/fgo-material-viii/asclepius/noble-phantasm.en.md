Resurrection Fraught Hades

The resurrection medicine Asclepius created to bring back the dead. Hades, the god of the Underworld, felt his territory was invaded when Asclepius resurrected the dead, so he turned to Zeus to punish him which brought about his end.

…However, this Noble Phantasm is not the “genuine” medicine and simply an imitation he created.

The resurrection medicine he once created and used was made from a unique raw material. Even as a Heroic Spirit, it is not a Noble Phantasm he can bring forth automatically. Thus, in regular Holy Grail Wars, he can only use this emulated medicine. Its effects are less pronounced, and several conditions must be met to be able to bring back the dead through this medicine, such as the post-mortem interval as well as the body’s condition. Having acquired modern medical knowledge, he self-deprecatingly compares this to “a slightly better AED”.

To add, this emulated medicine is quite valuable as is and its usage is limited.

Resurrection Fraught Hades

His true Noble Phantasm which he generally does not use (cannot use).

The very resurrection medicine that once invaded Hades’ territory and angered Zeus, capable of fully resurrecting humans and demigods even from extreme conditions. It is said that he used this to resurrect Glaucus, son of King Minos, and Hippolytus, son of Theseus.

This medicine was created with Gorgon’s blood given to him by Athena (which was an offering from Perseus). Blood from Gorgon’s left side had the power to destroy men, while blood from her right side had the power to save men. In truth, simply taking blood from Gorgon was not enough for it to work, as resurrecting Hippolytus was said to have been possible “with Artemis’ power”. The resurrection medicine was first completed because the blood was incorporated with the power of a pure god (Athena and Artemis-class). Some minor factors might have played a role as well.

Simply put, creating the resurrection medicine was made possible not just through his medical skills alone, but also by several factors and coincidences. Asclepius himself has yet to fully master its creation.

It goes without saying that Asclepius wants to create the true resurrection medicine once more.
Can I create it through my own abilities alone? Is it impossible to achieve it through simpler means? How do I mass-produce it?— He is, as expected, only thinking about the advancement of medicine.
