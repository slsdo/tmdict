Saṃsāra Kama/Mara Avarodha.
The personal Noble Phantasm of Beast III/L, as a special case, it possesses two True Names.
This is because they both represent the “same thing”.
In Sanskrit, saṃsāra is the “cycle of reincarnation” and is derived from Kama’s other name, “Samsara Guru”. In Sanskrit, avarodha means “obstacle” and it signifies the various ways with which Mara hindered Shakyamuni or, in other words, the temptation for depravity.

Love’s compulsion for debauchery in the sense of good and evil…
A Noble Phantasm of extreme depravity that displays an evil of cataclysmic scale with the power of two gods, Kama and Mara.
If one’s struck by this Noble Phantasm inside Kama’s universe, they might witness a hell────or perhaps heaven-like spectacle where “without distinction, Kama dispatches herself (doubles) everywhere, burning and exhausting the universe with her one-sided love”.

When the large-flowered lotuses bloom under Kama’s feet, she and the target she chose to love fall into the darkness of the universe.
Within the immeasurable darkness, Kama faces her partner and presents them her hand.
The hand that seems to be inviting a lover or perhaps tempting a saint, will turn into blue flames before lengthening and flowing through the darkness.
(Kama’s hand is the universe itself, so it will remain in space as the universe after lengthening)
The blue flames will eventually crash into the other party in the form of a gigantic arrow, piercing through them and imprisoning them in Kama’s universe.
Afterwards, the arms of flame become innumerable, filling the space vigorously and inexhaustibly as if to tear the world into pieces, and in the end, the immeasurable darkness is replaced with the blue universe of Kama────by the time one notices, everything has been captured within Kama’s arm.
Just like an ant encased in amber.

It is a powerful Noble Phantasm, but due to Beast III/L’s special characteristics, it also has its flaws where she is unable to love those in close proximity or just a single person. If her target of corruption is not “a large number of people”, but a “single person”, she can not wield this authority.
Her Noble Phantasm being single target in “FGO” signifies that Beast III/L was still in an immature stage.
