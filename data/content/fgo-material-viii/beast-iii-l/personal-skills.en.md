### Embrace of Dreams

Summons Mara’s “doubles” that are unevenly distributed inside the universe by “Constitution That Accepts Every Desire”.
Although they do not possess the Beast’s Crown of Light, the clone bodies’ abilities are of the same rank as Kama/Mara’s.

### Pathos Scepter: A

Her special trait as the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Hajun. The power of the Beast’s Crown of Light (scepter).
Depending on Beast III/L’s state and mood, it emits various beams of love.
“Free love”, “pure love”, “unjust love”, “unbiased love”, “inexhaustible love” and “everlasting love”; these six.
Each one will restore her HP and apply numerous debuffs to the target whenever she attacks.
The more Beast III/L fights, the more she will heal her wounds, weaken the opponent and multiply. When it comes to a battle of pure quantity, Beast III/L could be considered the strongest among the Beasts.

### Affection of the Heavenly Demon: A

A rare skill that activates after death.
The one who defeats Beast III/L or one of her doubles will have all of the debuffs that have been applied to them up to this point cleared.
A skill that embodies Beast III/L’s special trait of “loving even her killer”.
It has a disadvantageous effect for Beast III/L, but that might also serve as a source of amusement for her.
