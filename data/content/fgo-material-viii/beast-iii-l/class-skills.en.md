### Authority of the Beast: A

A skill that one could call Anti-Humanity.
She has a strong hold over lifeforms that require the “recognition of the living”.
Although lifeforms with differing forms of intelligence can not communicate their intentions and their meaning, Beast III’s devilish wiles do not require connecting through such intelligence and can corrupt her target through emotions alone.
One could even call it a special attack against growth, that makes one renounce hard work and compromise that their current situation is already “good enough”.

### Independent Manifestation: C

In a world overflowing with voices starving for love, she appears to satisfy them.
Of course, the world will be satisfied at the Beast’s discretion.

### Nega Desire: A

The absolute and ultimate skill of adoration possessed by the beast that is the incarnation of worldly desires.
No matter what kind of existence they are, those with desires will fall into depravity due to her love.
If all desires and appetites of the flesh can be fulfilled with infinite love, that is the same as erasing the concept of desire from the universe.
Also, as an existence that gives love, she is completely immune to “charm”.

### Constitution That Accepts Every Desire: EX

Originally, Kama/Mara was endowed with a high degree of diversity when it comes to shape and ability in order to answer the (worldly) desires of the multitude of humans inhabiting this world.
This diversity has been sublimated into a more specific form by the addition of the nature of infinity known as the universe.
It is an authority that makes sure that each and every (worldly) desire inhabiting this universe is cuddled close together, pampered, and corrupted. A theorem that, innumerable like stardust, there are freely customizable “all-accepting versions of her”.
In other words, the beast that is Kama/Mara is infinitely present in the universe known as her.
