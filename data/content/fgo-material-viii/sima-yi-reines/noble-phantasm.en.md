The Unspeakable Formation [Proper title: Formation of Formlessness].

The man named Sima Yi, by nature, was not a tactician who employed genius and clever schemes. Be it wars or power struggles, he would create battle formations, wait for the opportune moment, and claim victory all in a matter-of-factly manner, then proceed to morosely mutter poems he does not even like.

Simply put, it is a Noble Phantasm that “crushes an enemy’s strengths and exposes their weaknesses”.

When the illusory sun and full moon appear over the horizon, the world transforms and all kinds of mystics lose their meaning. In this case, this Noble Phantasm does not erase or nullify them. For example, it instead changes the battlefield into a sea against a Mystic Sword that can cleave land, or reduce the mana in the surroundings against a Servant skilled in magecraft.

“An enemy I have beaten before.” “An enemy I have sufficient data about.” If such conditions are met, even directly creating weaknesses for an enemy is possible. Sima Yi was the joker killer in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms who cornered both Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang and indirectly brought about their deaths.

Because this formation has no form, even those casted on have no means or words to describe it. Therefore, it is called the Unspeakable Formation.
