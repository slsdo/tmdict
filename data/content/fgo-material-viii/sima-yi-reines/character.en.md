### Personality

※Personality as Reines

Reines has a problematic personality and feels satisfaction at another person’s crisis and troubles.

Although she always speaks in an easygoing manner, she is actually extremely cautious. Schemes have become a forte of hers after all the assassination attempts on her as a Clock Tower Lord candidate.

Although she is friendly with the other Servants, especially with other female Servants, she never opens up to them at all. However, once you forge a genuine bond with her, she can be clingy and meddling in many ways. Very Reines-like.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Similar to the way she treats others, Reines interacts with her Master in an easygoing and lighthearted manner.

Because she bears the official title and responsibilities of a Clock Tower Lord, she took pity on the protagonist who suddenly found themself as the last Master in the world. She generally feels glee at her Master’s predicaments. However, with Sima Yi’s powers, she will surely be a powerful ally at crucial moments.

### Dialogue Examples

“I see, so you’ve summoned me. Sima Zhongda, at your service… Oh, yes, I’m a Pseudo Servant with Reines El-Melloi Archisorte as the vessel. Don’t worry, I acquired his powers and abilities. Feel free to call me however you want, be it Reines, Sima Yi, or Zhongda. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Master.”

“Behold! This is the fusion of the Supreme Mystic Code of the El-Mellois, one of the noble families of the Clock Tower, and the powers of a Servant! The pinnacle of all Pseudo Servants!

“Why am I wearing a western military uniform? Because I’m in the mood to wear one! Even my inner Sima Yi has a fondness for new culture!”

“Kick, punch, and suppress! That is the El-Melloi way! Hm? Could you keep your mouth shut for me, elder brother?”

“What do I like? The suffering of others, of course. I have a nasty personality after all. Watching a serious person gradually lose to his environment is the best entertainment for me! Hm? My, we see eye to eye, Lord Sima Yi.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

※The profile below is not of Sima Yi but of the vessel Reines.

Reines is the true Lord of the El-Melloi faction, one of the twelve noble families that operate the Mage’s Association. She should have already inherited the title, but she handed over the position to Lord El-Melloi II while she’s the one pulling the strings. This is due to several factors such as her age and power struggles, mixed with her personal interests. 

As a result, watching El-Melloi II suffer from stomach ache has become her favorite pastime.

Sima Yi was summoned as a result of Zhuge Liang being summoned in Lord El-Melloi II - in other words, “chain summoning”. Sima Yi was summoned because of his connection with Zhuge Liang, and for the same reason Reines was chosen because of her connection with El-Melloi II.

As a Pseudo Servant, Sima Yi also chose to have Reines’ personality to be the dominant one after finding out that’s what Zhuge Liang did. That said, Sima Yi is less of a pragmatist than Zhuge Liang is, and would sometimes appear and talk using Reines’ body. He only speaks on very few occasions, but based on Reines’ analysis, he apparently likes new things and has the same nasty personality as her.

Being able to overwork her elder brother is apparently a perk that comes with them sharing the same mission. For that, she readily accepted the task of restoring human order.

### Connections with Characters

#### Zhuge Liang (El-Melloi II)

My elder brother is quite busy growing and shrinking. In other words, stepping on him will be worthwhile.

#### Gray

You’re his apprentice. Feel free to be more vocal with him.

#### Olga Marie

Is that what you call fubin moe{{n1}}? 

#### El-Melloi Class

You all need to calm down.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Characters you find cute or feel sorry for because of the bad things that happen to them, they make you want to comfort or support them. Kinda similar to a woobie? A few examples would be Karamatsu (Osomatsu-san), Yazawa Nico (Love Live), and Satania (Gabriel DropOut) according to the Pixiv Encyclopedia.
