### Personality

Astraea, the embodiment of justice, has chosen a worthy person for possession. A person who was born for the purpose of standing above others————If one was to approve of that sort of concept, then it must be her. An aristocrat among aristocrats who does not lose their integrity while appearing to be more of a mage than anyone else. A rare girl who selfishly exercises the power of Mystery, and hopes for the future of Mystery, while still not losing her dignity. Because of those, the girl accepts the Authority called Justice as her own duty while never using it recklessly as a privilege of hers.

…But aside from those sorts of virtues, the girl has a notable characteristic where if she discovers a rare or precious thing, she considers it a target that should preferentially be brought under her own protection. In other words, the most graceful (hyena) in the heavens.

Even if it is the Master’s personal belongings, she may protect (seize) it if it is something worthy to her. It seems one should be careful if they must reveal a rare/precious article or technique before her eyes.

### Attitude towards Master

Of course, Astraea is also the embodiment of (human) justice, so she will not spare her efforts in her contributions to restore the Human Order. If it was an inexperienced Master, she would inspire them in that they still must lead the others. Simultaneously, coupled with the character of the possessed girl, she will be strict in pointing out the Master’s behaviour. If she feels the Master’s behaviour is indecent, it seems she will not hesitate to break into her (extremely physical) guidance protocol (that includes giving them a dropkick).

### Dialogue Examples

“I have come in response to your summons. Here is the judgement of the Scales, the justice of the stars. I am called Astraea, a fragment of everything that is eternally good. You who are my Master, are you ready to be measured?”
“Magic bullets in 1, 2, 3… and then, my backdrop and a falldown!”
“Then here… I will open the court of the stars.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Astraea’s origin is as one of the three Horae sisters in Greek mythology. Although she is considered to be a daughter of Zeus and Themis, the descriptions of her in the field of mythology is scarce. There are legends where, as the gods started to leave one by one as it became the Iron Age – where immorality is running rampant, Astraea remained behind on the surface to appeal to everybody the virtue of justice until the end. And after that, there were tales, although only few, that the Scales she carried became the constellation Libra, while she herself became the constellation Virgo.

However, in posterity, Astraea, her mother Themis, and Iustitia of Roman mythlogy, both of whom are regarded as one and the same with Astraea, were given another name and implication.

Namely, Lady Justice. The Goddess of Justice. If one were to find a statue of a goddess holding a sword and scales before a courthouse or a law office, that would be them.

Normal Catchphrase: “Do have your fill of the justice of the stars, the judgement of the Scales.”
Catchphrase from her other side: “The justice of the stars! Namely, a backdrop!”

Astraea in Greek mythology————Her aspect as the “Goddess of Justice” (Lady Justice) in Roman mythology is stronger than her aspect as a daughter of Zeus and Themis. This aspect as Lady Justice originally had rigid features as part of her functions and an inflexible disposition, but due to being influenced by the girl she possessed, she will now try to guide the people herself. It is also the same reason why that, although she is a Servant who carries a sword and scales, she is excessively obsessive about hand-to-hand combat, tossing both her armaments away at a critical moment, for her justice is surely hand-to-hand combat (pro wrestling). Perhaps it is said to be a nuisance, or perhaps it is said to be an inevitability due to the girl she chose to possess, but that girl’s style matches with Astraea, who is tenacious and unparalleled as a Divine Spirit that possesses judgement functions, and she ended up becoming one of the best Servants in regard to pure hand-to-hand combat performance.
