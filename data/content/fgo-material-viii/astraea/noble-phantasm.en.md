Custos Morum (The Guardian of Morals). A Noble Phantasm where the Scales – which is her primary Authority – are materialized, before it takes out the targets that should be judged to the courtroom of the starry sky and then dropping stardust onto them with the amount of stardust dropped being dependent on their crimes. In contrast with Ishtar who shoots out the concept of Venus in a single blow with all her might, Astraea dumps the concept of the many stars that are spread out over the night sky without any restraint.

Furthermore, the meaning of Custos Morum is “The Guardian of Morals” in Latin, which was a popular name for the Star Chamber court that was once set up by the Tudor Dynasty of England. Astraea judges the target with this court of the stars.

By the way, Astraea originally finishes her Noble Phantasm by exhaustively shooting magic bullets, but there is an alteration due to being fused with her human vessel where she adds a backdrop to finish them off.

Iam Redit et Virgo (Now Justice Returns). Astraea’s Second Noble Phantasm. If her First Noble Phantasm is the Scales that carries out the measurement of one’s crime, then her Second Noble Phantasm is a Noble Phantasm related to the Sword that continuously carries out judgements.

There are many extreme conditions in that Astraea cannot invoke this without assembling all the people involved with the incident in question, the full story of the crime(s) committed is clearly laid out, and moreover, the location of gathering is close to the stars, but when those conditions are cleared, it has an extraordinary effect where it restores the original forms of everything that was distorted according to those crimes. Although enacting the collapse of providence, such as the restoration of the deceased and time retrogression, is beyond its power, as long as the things being restored are within the limits of the Noble Phantasm, the strength and precision of the crimes would become irrelevant as it nullifies everything brought according to the outcomes of those crimes.

The Noble Phantasm’s name comes from an eclogue of Virgil and from the American phrase ‘new order of the ages’. The golden age has finally come back, and order has returned here.
