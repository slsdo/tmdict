### Protection of the Scales: A+

A Skill that originates from the Authority of the Divine Spirit Astraea. A Skill where the Scales – which is the symbol of Astraea – dwell within her body, deploying an absolute defense against the targets that should be judged. However, due to the inclinations of the possessed human, it has been modified into a Skill that is oriented towards hand-to-hand combat. In other words, a pro wrestler cannot be toppled over.

### Magical Burst (Star): A+

A Magical Burst Skill unique to Astraea, who is called a star maiden. It should be possible for her magical energy – which stems from the nature of the gods and the stars – to change its property, but perhaps due to the influence of the possessed girl, it is inclined to change into an extremely offensive-oriented property.

### Judgement of the Stars: A

A Skill where as long as one has become a target of judgement, not to mention a human on earth, but even a Divine Spirit can receive judgement via the power of the stars.
