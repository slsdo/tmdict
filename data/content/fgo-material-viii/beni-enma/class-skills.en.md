### Mind’s Eye (False) A

Resistance against penalties incurred from visual impairments.
The ability to foresee danger thanks to natural talent that one could liken to a sixth sense or a sense of foreboding.
I’m leaving the fact that I feel a connection with a certain Sasaki because of the completely identical technique and ability unsaid on purpose; when I meet that sham of a samurai, I’ll cut him down. Such are the thoughts Benienma harbors.
 
### Basket of the Stars (Big): EX

The first secret art of the Enjaku Sewing (Sword Drawing) Technique. The Wicker Basket of Retribution.
Two dice-like wicker baskets are taken out of the Straw Raincoat of the Sage and unsealed.
The unsealed baskets materialize as a large basket roughly 1 meter across and a small basket that’s roughly 30 cm across.
The Wicker Basket of Retribution reduces every enemy’s NP gauge, removes skill seal from her party, and as a bonus restores the enemies’ HP by a very small amount (300~500).
No matter how much of an unreasonable fate it forces on the opponent, its essence as a present is not lost. That’s how Benienma does things.
 
### Basket of the Stars (Small): EX

The second secret art of the Enjaku Sewing (Sword Drawing) Technique. The Wicker Basket of Gratitude.
A stupidly broken cheat skill.
It buffs the attack power of the party, charges their NP, and also heals them. The heck is this, how scary.
And then, for some reason, it also restores the enemies’ HP a little (800~1000).
Leaving aside how much favorable development it grants to its own team, its appearance as a gift must be kept. That’s how Benienma does things.
