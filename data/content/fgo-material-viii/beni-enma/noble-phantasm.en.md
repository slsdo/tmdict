Juuou Hanketsu・Tsudzura no Michiyuki.
The third secret art of the Enjaku Sewing (Sword Drawing) Technique.
The wicker basket that calls forth calamity is summoned and unsealed.
The hyakki yakou (in truth, just a bunch of sparrows) emerging from the basket throw the enemy into disorder and seal them inside.
Afterwards, they are transported to the inn of the sparrows where, in the tatami room of the sparrows who dressed up as the Ten Kings of Hell (Ten kings with jurisdiction over the dead. King Enma is one of them.), they receive Benienma’s sword of judgment.
Deals bonus damage against those with the “Chaotic” and/or “Evil” traits. Servants with both traits receive the full-course judging by default.

Suzume Gaeshi.

The zeroth secret art of the Enjaku Sewing (Sword Drawing) Technique.

The briefest, smallest and deepest iai battoujutsu{{n1}} where, having grasped the instant the opponent opens their mouth from having their breathing thrown into disorder, she transforms into her original size (sparrow size) and closes the distance at a speed that one can not perceive, before cutting out only the opponent’s tongue.
“I won’t take your life. However, that duplicitous tongue of yours won’t be forgiven”
A secret technique overflowing with such a Benienma’s kindness.
…Is how it was supposed to be, but, going “Nonetheless, battles are not so sweet that one can survive them with only this much”, she modified the technique.
It has been converted into the disciplinary art of the devil where, at first, she rushes at the opponent and performs six spinning slashes (nicknamed Sextuple Sparrow); then, the moment the opponent lets out a voice of anguish from the intense pain, she aims for the inside of their mouth and performs a tongue-cutting needlework finish. Other than causing great damage, it also seals their skills for three turns.
(It is not used in Fate/GO)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} I’m sure you’ve seen a samurai or swordsman cutting down their opponent in the blink of an eye and sheathing their swords right afterwards in animes. That’s an iai. Battoujutsu is the art of drawing one’s sword.
