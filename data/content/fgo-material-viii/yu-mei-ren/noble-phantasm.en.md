A drastic move where Consort Yu causes her magical energy to rampage by destroying her own body in order to go over its limits, and after causing an abnormal weather attack by means of a hex, she reconstructs her body over again. For the Elemental Spirit Species where their Spiritual Core is being shared with the environment, it is possible to say that this is a suicide bomb attack.

Since it is an attack method that disregards even her coordination with the other Servants and the safety of her Master, the number of situations where this can be used is limited.
