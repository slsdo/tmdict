### Incarnated Elemental Spirit: A

Since she is an Elemental Spirit Species that can share her magical energy with the natural world and its Mana, it is feasible for Consort Yu to draw an inexhaustible supply of magical energy from the physical world rather than storing magical energy within her own body. But since she is restricted to a form that is “humanoid”, even if her supply of magical energy is infinite, there is a limit to her output, so the quantity of magical energy she can practically use is being stopped within the domain of a humanoid Heroic Spirit.

### Feathered Person of the Immortal Realm: A

Consort Yu is a Xian [Immortal] that were spoken of in Taoist ideology; one who has immortality. Because interferences from the natural world is required in order for her to maintain her body, it is possible to say that she is restricted to a humanoid form as a result.

### Bloodsucking: C

It is feasible for Consort Yu to deprive a fixed amount of energy from any lifeform – regardless if it is a plant or an animal – and use it for herself. It is strictly different from the act of bloodsucking, but she is recognized as a bloodsucking species because of this ability, so she has come to receive persecution from Executors throughout successive generations.
