### Personality

Due to the particulars of how she came to be persecuted by humanity for a long time, Consort Yu is a staunch misanthropist. However, she was touched by the fact that Xiang Yu – the only person who understood her – desired for “a repose to the world of humans” until the very end, so she consented to being added to the Throne of Heroes, a place that houses the protectors of the Human Order.

Although she loathes human civilization, Consort Yu does not loathe humans as a lifeform. She possesses a peculiar sense of ethics that should even be said to be a “wild fundamentalism” so to speak, generally affirming in a providence where the strong eats the weak and flourish. However, she exposes her anger towards the use of science and technology to the extent that it overturns the order of the natural world as well as monotheistic values such as “God desired such a thing from humans.”

Nonetheless, concerning Consort Yu, the particulars of her appearance into the world where she was a specimen who came from a colony is a trauma to her, albeit an unconscious one, and although the person in question firmly denies it, her true character is that of someone who easily succumbs to loneliness. Towards those with the attitude to be able to become a person of understanding to her, she reaches the point that she can embrace a fairly deep compassion for them (without making a distinction of them as a plant, an animal, an android, etc.).

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

It must be remembered that Consort Yu denies the stance of “protecting humanity”, defining herself instead as a Heroic Spirit in the position of an arbitrator who monitors the humanity that does not grasp what mess they are going to make in this future. But if “someone who can lead the people very well” appears to her among the many humans, then she is willing to support them.

Consort Yu will cooperate with the Master with the justification of “because I firmly detest getting involved with the world of humans.” Although she quibbles with them for various reasons and flames them with abusive language, she feels a repose that will never be over, for she had wished for “a place where someone considers her to be necessary and where her existence is allowed”, so if it is for the sake of maintaining that environment, she will not spare herself in desperately exhausting her efforts to maintain it.

### Dialogue Examples

“Recently… everything’s like a fleeting dream. I don’t even have the mood anymore to reflect on them.”
“I have no intention in protecting humans, not one bit. I’ll only stop you from arriving at the point of extinction caused by your own folly… Because if it was that person, he would have done such a thing.”
“Ah, good grief, why do naked monkeys like you all carry the fate of this planet? How about you bear in mind that responsibility seriously?”
“Yakisoba sandwich. You understand, don’t you?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Xiang Yu’s favourite mistress who was told of in fragments in the Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han, and someone who was engulfed in mystery. In folklore, Consort Yu committed suicide after Xiang Yu’s death, and that anecdote has given another name to the red poppy flower: the field poppy [Yú Měirén Cǎo].

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A bloodsucking species that acquires nourishment through energy drains. They are not a kind of Demonic Beast or Phantasmal Beast, but terminals that originated from the Earth’s inner sea for the sake of managing its surface… They are Elemental Spirits. In the magic world, this species of Elemental Spirits are close to a category of being that is called a “True Ancestor”, but although the process of how they originated resembles that of a True Ancestor’s, they are another kind of bloodsucking species with their purpose as an existence differing from theirs.

Consort Yu is a Xiannu [female Immortal], a Zhenren [True Human], that were spoken of in ancient Chinese traditions, and since she acquired a reason and a self-consciousness much later after her appearance in the world, she herself does not know what her origins are or how she came to be. With her circumstances of complete isolation, with neither a family nor a group she can belong to, and while being weary and fearful of humans, single-mindedly running away and hiding from human society that continues to expand, Consort Yu refused to commit suicide and fulfilled her duty to Xiang Yu, who was the only person who understood her, and she continued to live for a time that lasts for eternity. In the middle of her destiny towards a long, long road of wandering, she saved up all the exhaustion of wandering she had built, and if she can get to a place where she can feel at ease, even for a brief moment, then she will embrace a desperate desire where it does not matter if that place is connected to her own ruin so long as she gets there.

On the other hand, Consort Yu laments for her own future after the death of Xiang Yu, someone who she mourns for even now, and she is caught in a self-contradiction where she cannot even make a bold start on a quick suicide. As far as she is concerned, the place called Chaldea – a place where inhuman Heroic Spirits gather and where equilibrium is preserved among the various purposes of the various people there – possesses a special meaning as “a place where people are not even frightened by what kind of person she is”, a place that she did not reach for the very long time of 2000 years, until now.
