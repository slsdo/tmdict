To tell you the truth, I started with Yu Meiren’s design before Hinako’s. The first thing I imagined was “Farewell My Concubine” that was starred by Leslie Cheung… In the beginning, the design was extremely Chinese-like, but eventually, I formed Yu Meiren’s current design which was completely different to the previous design. There was a suggestion of “Her design should be more modernistic!”; that is the 2nd Stage of Yu Meiren’s design. After that, I did things such as adding glasses and adding fabric to her, and those became the designs of her 1st Stage and 3rd Stage respectively. (toi8)
