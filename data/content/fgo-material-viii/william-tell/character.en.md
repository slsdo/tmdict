### Personality

A hunter that lives together with nature.
The simple and virile disposition to love his family.
He doesn’t really like doing flashy or pompous things.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He doesn’t really have a wish for the Holy Grail.
But if there was something he would wish for,
he would seek 『a world in which his family can live happily』.

He treats the Master as he normally would treat a Master.
But if it’s someone he has taken a liking to, he may see them as his son · daughter.
In that case, he would try to guide the Master to the righteous path as much as he could, and scold them when they make a mistake.

### Dialogue Examples

「Did you call? My name’s William Tell. You don’t seem to have the kind of face…
to ask me to shoot some beasts at the forest. Good grief…」
「I’d like you to know. That the evil governor’s heart and the apple above my head’s son weren’t fun to shoot at. …If I got in the same situation again, I don’t know if I could do the same thing」
「Wow, a mythological hunter? If there’s a chance I’d like both of us to go to the mountains.
It’d be nice to show that the Hunter of Uri’s skill is nothing to sneeze at…」
「Hehhe, I actually like new stuff. Whether it is for hunting or not, I surprisingly accept what I think it’s good easily. I’m fond of this crossbow and these clothes, and tobacco… Ah, having one smoke after finishing a hunt feels delicious…」

### Historical Image · Character Image

William Tell (Wilhelm Tell in local Swiss German)
is a legendary character who lived at Uri, central Switzerland, in the late 13th century ~ early 14th century.
His name was popularized as a character appearing on a drama, but for the people of Switzerland,
he is accepted as a hero that symbolizes the nation building movement.

The region of Switzerland at that time was in a spot in which three provinces signed an alliance for their autonomous independence from the Habsburg family,
and created the base form of the later Swiss Federation.
In one of these provinces, Uri, lived an Austrian governor called Hermann Geßler.
He erected a pole on the central square and hung his hat on it, and forced the residents that passed in front of it to
bow their heads and pay respect to that hat.

But Tell, who passed in front of the hat together with his son, was arrested since he didn’t bow his head.
Geßler told Tell, who was an expert with the crossbow, 「If you can pierce an apple placed on the top of your son’s head I will forgive you」.
The young son refused to be tied up or blindfolded, and headed on his own accord to the trunk of a linden tree.
「Why do I need to be scared? I trust on my father’s skill. Come on Dad, show him」.
And so Tell splendidly pierced the apple above his son’s head thanks to that trust,
and the released father and child gave each other a tight hug.

Immediately after.
At the moment of shooting the apple, Geßler noticed that Tell had hidden another arrow in his pocket apart from the one nocked on his crossbow.
Geßler asked for the meaning of that arrow.
Then he announced 「Had the first arrow pierced something other than the apple, I intended to kill you with this arrow」
A wrathful Geßler arrested him again, and tried to drag him away from the country.
But Tell succeeded in escaping halfway and survived.

And ——— In order to escape from the governor’s revenge, in order to protect his sons from the governor’s rage,
Tell did what he had to do.
Tell sniped Geßler, who was riding a horse at a narrow defile, and pierced his heart.

The town that lost its tyrant returned to peace, Tell was praised as a hero,
and starting from this case, the momentum of the Swiss independent movement became increasingly stronger ———.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Just like the play depicts him, he’s a man with the courage to face the oppressors that make the people suffer.
But he wasn’t driven by a political · national sense of danger, if anything his motives were personal.
As a hunter, as a father, as a man.
As a result of doing what he had to do, he became a warrior of justice.
That means he became a realistic hero.
A sometimes shallow, sometimes warm, and scary when angry man that has the boldness and composure to protect his family, as if he embodied the concept of 『fathers are heroes』 itself.

### General Armaments

Crossbow.
