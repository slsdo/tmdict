Apfel Schießen.
The reading means 『Shooting the apple』.
The legendary arrow shot with a crossbow that admirably pierced the apple placed on top of his son’s head.
This arrow released after receiving the trust on the son’s father will never fail, and will 『certainly』 pierce the target.
Summarizing, this Noble Phantasm has the property of interfering with the law of cause and effect, and evasion is fundamentally impossible.

### Zweite Schießen: Released Second Best Second Arrow

Zweite Schießen.
A second Noble Phantasm that is activated only supposing the case in which the first Noble Phantasm that 『will never fail』 misses.
It’s derived from the anecdote in which Tell, thinking on what would happen if he missed the apple on his son, had a hidden arrow in order to shoot at the evil governor Geßler.
This arrow is released at the same time 『it must be shot in the case of the first arrow missing』.
That means this arrow is a Noble Phantasm that is conceptually overlapped and exists multiple times.
If the first arrow hits properly it will never be activated.

As if he was saying 『If I miss the apple on top of my son’s head (the first shot) everyone will die, so I have to shoot at the governor that gave that order (second shot) if I fail』, depending on the situation it can be released deciding where to shoot it at.
It’s possible to choose the same target as the first shot as well, and it will certainly pierce the target by interfering with the law of cause and effect in the same manner.
However it’s hard to fire randomly since the mana consumption becomes intenser.
… Although the situation in which 『the first arrow that will absolutely hit』 fails is not frequently seen.
