William Tell-san’s image was 「Morizō」{{n1}}. But, searching again Morizō is a quite monochrome green, it didn’t have multi-cam camouflage. William Tell-san couldn’t be that green…! He had the image of an austere father from the beginning, but I thought 「Is it too funky?」 when I painted his hair pink in a rush so I dropped the colorfulness. (Takahashi Keitarō)
