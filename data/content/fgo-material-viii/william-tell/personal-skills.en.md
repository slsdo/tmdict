### Hunter of Uri: B

The techniques of hunting he learned while living with the nature in the province of Uri, currently in central Switzerland.
What lies at the basis of the widely known famous hunter.
Compositely includes several skills and techniques related to hunting such as obviously treatment of the crossbow, good visual acuity, the ability to grasp the target with the eyesight, creation of traps, their adequate installation… and so forth.
In the mountains of Uri it’s equivalent to EX.
If he takes time to get used to mountains he doesn’t know, the skill rank rises substantially.

### Unwavering Patience: C

Waiting for the prey still and without moving when it’s cold or when it’s hot, with a patience like a huge rock.
The reason why this skill is separated while parts of it are contained within the 1st skill is because this patience is the basis of a lifestyle of him providing for his family in a rustic way that goes along with nature and not having a gaudy life, and because according to legend he used this for other things besides hunting.
After the incident of the apple on his son’s head, he lurked patiently in the mountains, and waited for the evil governor to cross a defile.
Everything until now, and everything from now on. What should be done, and what must be done.
While thinking about that, he kept waiting, still, still ———.

### Aiming: EX

A skill that represents the ability to take aim with projectiles.
Ability to concentrate as the hunter who ran through the mountains of Uri. Can even shoot through the apple placed on top of his son’s head.
In addition to the high concentration to put even breathing and heartbeats under perfect control, by perfectly adapting them to the environment of the external world without being noticed,
he doesn’t 「hit」, but gets the result of 「naturally hitting」.
This is said to be connected to the spirituality of Japanese archery in Orient.
