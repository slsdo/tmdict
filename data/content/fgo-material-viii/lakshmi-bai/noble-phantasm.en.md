A Noble Phantasm that gives form to Lakshmibai’s strong determination and wish of “never handing over her motherland”.
 
Once the king of the princely state of Jhansi died, Bai, who was bereaved of her child, tried to adopt a child to keep the kingdom alive, but the British, aiming for the chance of destroying the monarchy, did not recognize that and one-sidedly decided on the annexation of Jhansi. In response to that, Bai, despite being a woman, gave them her words of refusal: “I will never give up my Jhansi (Mere Jhansi nahin denge)”─────or so the anecdote goes.
Eventually, this incident became the starting point for her────and also the princely state of Jhansi’s participation in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and them gaining fame as a great force of resistance.
 
Originally, it is a barrier-type Noble Phantasm that creates an absolute domain that defends against the invasion and assault of the opponent.
Accordingly with the definition that “she is an existence that risked her life to protect the kingdom of Jhansi”, invoking it connects cause and effect as in “whatever she protects is her kingdom”.
 
Due to being summoned as a Saber this time, the Noble Phantasm functions as an Anti-Army variant that transformed the concept of “rejecting outside invaders” into an attack.
The flash of the sword that carries all of her feelings is the determination to bear the life or death of the country itself.
Therefore, as a blade that will never bend or break, it mows down the enemy with a weight and brilliance equal to the future of a whole country.
