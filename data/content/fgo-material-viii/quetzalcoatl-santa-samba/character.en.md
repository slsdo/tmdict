### Personality

She’s not any different from the usual Quetzalcoatl.
However, whenever some trouble happens she seems to always try and solve it with the rhythm of samba or her Santa moves. I mean, while she went through the trouble of becoming Santa.
What if that doesn’t work?

Then it’s time for lucha.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She doesn’t have a wish for the grail.
Actually, she managed to become a Santa due to the power of the christmas grail, so she’s satisfied with just that.

In this holy festival she relies on her Master as her manager, or as her corner man.
Her Master already has so much to do that she doesn’t expect them to act as a reindeer (she uses her Quetzalcoatlus for this). However if they still feel like helping, she will gladly take them along to deliver presents.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’ll give you a finishing hold as a present!”
“I got a bit confused, but isn’t it fun to deliver presents while dancing samba? A samba Santa, there is nothing more wonderful than this. Leave it to me Master! I’ll do my best to bring back our proper christmas!”
“Christmas, lucha and samba were all things created by humans. That’s why I love them all so much!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Quetzalcoatl had suddenly been chosen as the next Santa by her predecessor, Altera the San(Ta).
She simply took the power of the Christmas grail and gladly became a santa, but then three problems occurred.

1-Quetzalcoatl had mixed up Santa and Samba.
2-Due to having taken in a concept foreign to her american divinity such as Santa Claus, two aspects of herself became divided, “the kind goddess Quetzalcoatl” and “the fighting goddess Quetzalcoatl”.
3-Due to the shock of having been divided, the evil Quetzalcoatl “Black Quetzal” stole the grail and flew to Mexico.

Quetzalcoatl was too caught up in her duties as Santa at the time so she reassured everyone that there was no need to worry. But of course, there was.
In no time, Quetzalcoatl received a report that Mexico had turned into a singularity.
When she arrived, she saw the strange sight of a Mexican city filled with snow.
There was also a mysterious event, the Santa Tag Tournament, where the winning team would be given the power to become a true santa.

### Role within the Game

She appeared in Christmas 2018 Holy Samba Night.
She enters the tag tournament in order to defeat Black Quetzal, teaming up with the female knight she met as her tag partner, and brings along her Master as her manager and corner man.

### General Armaments

Christmas Assault.

### Connections with Characters

#### Santa Servants

“I’m so happy I always get new companions every year!
Now all together, let’s make the children of the world happy!”

#### Bradamante

Her trusted tag partner. She wants to fight together with her if they ever get the chance.
She already has a mask prepared for her.

#### Mata Hari

A wonderful dancer she wants to have join her samba team.
She already has a samba outfit prepared for her.

#### Mysterious Alter Ego Λ

“Oh I know, you’re a dancer too, right?
Huh? You only dance on ice?
…A deathmatch on top of an ice ring? That’s what you mean right? Ok, I’ll take you on!”

#### Astraea

A new worthy opponent who appeared suddenly like a comet.
“Her wrestling or my lucha libre, I really want us to test out which is best!”
However, as she’s looking forward to it way too much, she’s still avoiding facing her off officially on top a ring.

Whenever they happen to meet when walking down the halls, they stare at each other keeping their distance and walk to their sides while drawing a circle, each of them waiting for the other to make a move.
If one were to sound a bell at that moment, there’s no doubt that the two would launch themselves at the other.
