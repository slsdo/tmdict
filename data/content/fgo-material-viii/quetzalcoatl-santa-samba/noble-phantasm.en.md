Yucatán Regalo de Navidad.
“What’s that!?” “It’s a star!” “It’s a space colony!”
“No, it’s a Christmas present!”
A move created by Santa Quetzalcoatl where she delivers a present with all of her power.
“Regalo de Navidad” is the literal translation to Spanish of “Christmas present”.
This NP is also known as The Yucatán-style Present Slam.

Due to Quetzalcoatl having let herself go in the middle of Samba’s liberating rhythm, the present that gets released turns out to be one of enormous size. Its impact is said to be similar to that of the giant meteor that crashed in the Yucatan peninsula, which is also said to be the origin of her as a deity. Of course, her present isn’t filled with whatever it was that exterminated the dinosaurs, but it is filled with whatever makes children happy.
Even if she where to unleash it upon a bad guy in the ring, it would still only make the children watching their match happy, and thus, this Noble Phantasm exists solely to bring smiles to children.
