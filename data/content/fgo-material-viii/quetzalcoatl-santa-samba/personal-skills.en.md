### Sambista: B

One who loves Samba.
Her life of samba had all begun from a slight misunderstanding, but since she thought that if she was gonna do it she had to do it correctly, she ended up studying about it deeply, and of course being the human-lover that she is, she ended up thinking samba was truly wonderful.
Now she’s come to love the culture of samba created by humans in the middle of their growth.

The problem is that she had nobody around who knew of the correct way to do samba, so at the end of her training she ended up acquiring a style of samba that might be a little different from the usual…but she doesn’t really mind.
After all, the most important thing is to have fun, right?

### Gift from the Goddess: A

A variation of Saint’s Gift and Starman’s Gift.
Even after becoming a Santa, the fact that she’s a goddess still remains.

### Christmas Assault: EX

Quetzalcoatl is a luchadora at heart.
However she’s now also a Santa.
In order to erase the paradox created by her nature she created this skill that allows her to maintain her movements as befitting of a Santa while she also fights in the ring. Therefore, these are not aerial assault anymore but rather “Christmas Assault”.
Her style of fighting is now not one that specializes in aerial fighting but rather one that specializes is fighting around the very concept of Christmas.

They say that when Santa Claus flies in the air you can hear a holy bell counting three times in the jungle of the ring’s mat.
