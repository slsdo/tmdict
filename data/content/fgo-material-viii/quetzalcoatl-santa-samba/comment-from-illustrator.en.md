“The word ‘samba santa’ exuded so much power that it took a while until my mind could really process it. I did what I could and designed her, but the fact I couldn’t do much more than add christmas tree motifs to a simple samba outfit is a result of my own lack of power as an artist. I really need to get better at character design…I also tried to give her a fit body due to her being a lucha master, but she ended up looking more like a competitive swimmer. I’m sorry. I’ll do better next time so please let me draw Quetzalcoatl again.” (Hiroe Rei)
