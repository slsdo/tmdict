### Magic Resistance: A+

Her already powerful magic resistance has become even stronger after having turned into a Ruler.
Unlike the one possessed by the Saint-type Rulers, hers is more based around “taking it and enduring it”. Even if its damage that could be avoided, she will still take it head on.

### Goddess’ Essence: A

A skill symbolizing how she’s been a fully realized goddess since birth.
A skill that sustains the absolute nature of her mind and body. It blocks out any mental interference and halts her body’s growth, so no matter how many calories she consumes, her body will not change.
It is a composite skill that includes the Divinity skill.
Due to having been embedded with such a foreign concept like that of Santa, its rank has degraded compared to when she’s a Rider.
