Brahmashirastra.
The ultimate weapon, received from his father Drona.
Although he was told not to use this weapon no matter what kind of disaster he encountered, Ashwatthama finally activated it, sparked by Duryodhana’s death.
This weapon that possesses the destructive power to paralyze the world,
despite having been antagonized by Arjuna shooting with his bow at full power, left ravages that were said to turn the whole surroundings into a barren land for twelve years.
Although it’s registered as a Noble Phantasm,
Ashwatthama will not use this Noble Phantasm.
It will not be used in 『FateGO』 either.

### Sudarshan Chakra – Yamraj: O’ Chakra, Stir Up the Raging Flames

Sudarshan Chakra – Yamraj.
Unusually, the weapon he didn’t, he couldn’t use in his previous life, has become a Noble Phantasm.
He who has obtained the giant chakram, freely used this weapon and kept carving it in his memory as a warrior at the time of being summoned as a Servant.

In other words, the entirety of his way to use the chakram is self-taught, an original style that wasn’t taught by anyone.
