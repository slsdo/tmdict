### Personality

Stern. He’s continuously angry, to the point that most of his words give the illusion of him yelling.
He’s a straightforward person that laments and resents the unreasonableness of this world more intensely than others, but he’s ideal as a warrior.

### Attitude towards Master

He will never treat them rudely, and will work seriously… but. He would probably enter a super-serious mode surpassing seriousness at the time the Master he’s bound to by a strong bond dies.
The type that is utterly unfitting for a regular Holy Grail War.

### Dialogue Examples

「The oath of warriors is long since gone, we have been depraved!
Even so I raged against depravity, and continued raging myself!
Dash! Sudarshan Chakra – Yamraj!」

「Alright Master! You took in my rage and accepted it, didn’t ya?
Then let’s rage together.
Listen, humans are living beings that rage!
Against unreasonable things, you gotta rage, rage, and rage!
It’s okay, I’ll rage with ya!」

「’Kay. Then, let’s do it. This moment is the only chance. Well, it’s like there was no “time” here, though. I’ll use all I have to pull ya outta here. You use all you have to claw yer way up from here」

### Historical Image · Character Image

Ashwatthama is a warrior of the strongest rank that appears in the Mahabharata, and despite not having the same dramatic quality as Karna or Arjuna, he owns an abundance of episodes.

It is said that, having learned of rage with the death of all the important men of his army, starting with Karna among them, the fall of the leader Duryodhana into a moribund state, and the murder of his father Drona, his comrade in arms Karna, and the king he served, Duryodhana, through cowardly tricks, he carried out a nocturnal assault prohibited by the written vows of the warrior status, slaughtered thousands of people, and was driven to an effective rout.

After that, he was punished to wander the forests during 3,000 years for surrendering. Also, the jewel on his forehead that he submitted as a proof of surrender, would be later inserted in the royal crown.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In any case, he’s solely angry. Angry for unreasonableness, angry for sadness, angry for arrogance.
On the other hand, he loves justice greatly, and has a disposition to cry often when he’s moved.
However, he swore not to hate. He has always wished to become a being that raises an objection against the unreasonable world.

Together with the Master he rages, laughs, and cries.
That’s Ashwatthama.

In contrast, regarding the Indian deity Parvati,
he temporarily seals his emotions and deals with her respectfully.

### General Armaments

#### Giant Chakram (Sudarshan Chakra)

A weapon he actually couldn’t obtain in his previous life. Originally the weapon used by Krishna. After becoming an Archer, he worked hard and obtained it or something like that.

It seems his proficiency improves with every Holy Grail War, but details are unknown.

### Connections with Characters

#### Karna

A sworn friend. In their previous life, Ashwatthama thought fondly of him, who despite not having new fellowships was honest and didn’t have two faces. He’s a bit worried that, after Karna’s death, he was defeated despite leading the army as a marshal (obviously Karna isn’t worried about it, though).

#### Arjuna

Actually in a relation in which they have crossed blades on countless occasions. However, since they had a friendship in their previous life, it’s slightly awkward. The topic of nocturnal assaults in particular can’t be touched.

#### Parvati

A respectable goddess.
Ashwatthama usually is so stern he could be likened to a tiger, but in front of her he’s in a temporary cat state.

#### Rama

He wanted to do a contest with his arrows as an Archer,
but it can’t be helped that he’s a Saber…. And so, he’s slightly chagrined.

#### Chiron / Tristan

Although they’re Servants far away from India,
he strangely has good compatibility with both for some reason.
He learns from Chiron’s greed to knowledge,
and from Tristan’s brashness when push comes to shove.
