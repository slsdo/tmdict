He whose half of the body is inhabited by Shiva, will never stop until the enemy is defeated once his rage is fired up.

### Jewel of Mani: B

A jewel embedded in his forehead since he was born.
With this, he could defend himself from demonic entities or beasts.
Later, he handed it over as a proof of surrender.

### Violation of Chivalry: A

The vows established between the warrior class (Kshatriya) were trampled underfoot in succession at the great war of the Mahabharata.
Vengeance called vengeance, and offense propagated offense. Ashwatthama was so angry, he performed a prohibited nocturnal assault, and brought down the enemy.

### Warrior of the Emperor: A+

A sublimation of the anecdote in which he was praised as the best warrior in the Mahabharata, ranked equal to Arjuna and Karna.
(Although his social status is a Brahmin)
Combined with Violation of Chivalry and Personification of Rage he becomes a mad warrior superior to a Berserker.
Itâ€™s not like he loses his rationality, but his tolerance to weak points is slightly weakened due to being in a state of extreme fury.

### Divinity: A+

He is said to have half the body of the highest Indian god, the avatar of destruction, Shiva.
