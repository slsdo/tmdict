Tsumukari Muramasa.
A Noble Phantasm that creates the ultimate sword. After deploying a unique Reality Marble, a wasteland of countless swords similar to the Heroic Spirit Emiya’s Unlimited Blade Works, all the swords shatter and scatter like snow crystals to reveal a single blade in Senji Muramasa’s hands. A single slash of this cuts time, space, and even fate.
“Every path, every desire, every injustice… All of it has been for this single swing.”
The blade’s name: Tsumukari Muramasa. The term Tsumukari refers to Tsumukari-no-Tachi, the sacred sword of Ama-no-Murakumo/Kusanagi that emerged from the tail of Japan’s greatest serpent and calamity, the monster with red eyes, eight heads and a length spanning eight valleys called Yamata-no-Orochi, which was killed by Susanoo-no-Mikoto.

According to one theory, “kusa (草)” is a word that indicates a degree of origin{{n1}} and “zo (雑)” is a word related to cutting, which together give Kusanagi the meaning of “a sword that can cut well and frighteningly”. (Another theory gives it the meaning of “sword that came out of a snake,” since Kusa means odor and Nagi means a snake.)
Generally speaking, it is said that the name of the sword “Kusanagi” is a name linked to the later Yamato Takeru{{n2}} legend. However, Motoori Norinaga says in the Kojikiden that the sword was actually called the Kusanagi sword from the moment Susanoo took it in his hand{{n3}}.

But creating clothing of that caliber can also be very draining to the creator. Once her masterpiece clothes your form, you are bound to realize: ah, she has flown away, beyond the sunset, leaving a memento of herself…

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Apparently one of the alternative meaning of this kanji is “draft” or “rough copy”.
2. {{note2}} Japanese Hero and Prince. Obtained the Kusanagi from his anut Yamatohime-no-mikoto, high priestess of Amaterasu. Amaterasu obtained it from her brother Susanoo who gave it to her to settle an old debt. As a legendary hero he did legendary things but died of illness when he blasphemed against a God living in Mount Ibuki.
3. {{note3}} This took me a while (and lot of Google searching) to understand but basically the sword has two names: “Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi” and “Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi” and one source says that “Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi” was the original name and it wasn’t called “Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi” until Yamato Takeru got a hold of the sword but another says that it was always called “Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi”.
