Originally drawn as a Craft Essence illustration called “Limited/Zero Over”, it was “the figure of Shirou Emiya, who was successful as a Magus”, but after many twists and turns he became a servant The first Saint Origin is the same as the design of the Craft Essence. The second Saint Graph is the heyday of Muramasa as a craftsman. The third is the image of Muramasa as a so-called “grandfather”. I had a lot of trouble with the direction of the second, but for the third, I felt like this was the only choice. Since the idea of a Perfect Shirou was an important aspect of the design that couldn’t be left out, the white hair and brown skin, the symbol of the Heroic Spirit EMIYA, had to be included. Shimokoshi-kun{{n1}} was in charge of weapons-related matters. (Takashi Takeuchi)
