### Tameshi-Mono: B+

An exercise meant to test the sharpness and sturdiness of a sword.
Senji Muramasa is able to draw out the power within a weapon he touches, and if he is willing, he can release the weapon’s full strength, though this destroys it in a single swing.

### Karmic Eye: A

An ability that is dormant within one’s body.
It’s a variation of Clairvoyance, and enhances both static and kinetic eyesight.
It is a type of insight specialized for combat. He lacked the proper foresight of Clairvoyance…or at least that was supposed to be the limitation…but with Muramasa spending his lifetime peering into destiny in the flames of his forge, his eagle-eyed gaze not only enabled him to capture his prey, but also fate itself.
Increase C. Star Drop Rate, increase Critical Strength and Apply Ignore Invincible (Is it possible for the Ignore Invincible to be a counter based system that would only get used when attacking enemies with Invincible and do nothing against normal enemies?) (It was not possible)

### Flame: EX

Using one’s whole body and soul to work the forge, to the point of burning themself.
At the end of a pilgrimage, his actions on the “Inner Sea of the Planet” were engraved in the Throne of Heroes, resulting in the creation of this skill.
It is Similar in nature to Altria Caster’s Holy Sword Creation but it only affects Muramasa Gains 50% NP Gauge, applies Special Attack against Evil, Special Attack against Threats to Humanity and Increases NP damage
As a side note, this skill was supposed to have a 2-turn stun after use (actually, it should have killed him straight up, but that would be too convenient), but since he was implemented earlier than Chapter 6 of Part 2, the stun was removed to prevent spoilers. Instead, the effect was changed to a simple skill effect.{{n1}}

### Wrought Iron Will: A+

Like Wrought Iron his soul is resistant to fatigue{{n2}}. With each strike his way of life is further tempered.
(Fundamentally not used in FGO)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The “kill” in “simple kill effect” was in katakana Edit: I am a dumbass It said “simple skill effect” not “simple kill effect”.
2. {{note2}} The kanji used was “弛む” which has the meaning of “to slacken, to sag or to become loose” which didn’t fit the whole “wrought iron” motif so after a bit of searching I found that one of wrought iron’s qualities is being resistant to fatigue, which kind of fit what the sentence was going for so that’s what I used.
