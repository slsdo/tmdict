### Magic Resistance: B

Nullifies spells with a chant below three verses.
Even if targeted by greater magecraft and Greater Rituals, it is difficult for him to be affected.

### Territory Creation: A

Senji Muramasa uses his own workshop, his forge, as his base.
Obviously this skill is different from what mages use, but this Caster class skill is thought to have been granted to him upon his manifestation as a Servant as an interpretation of his abilities.
He possesses an unparalleled Territory Creation ability, as he was an eminent craftsman.

### Connoisseur of Blades: A

This skill is similar to Aesthetic Appreciation and represents understanding of armaments.
A skill that allows him to instantly discern how to fight against normal weapons (not Noble Phantasms). The user gains an understanding of armaments other than swords if the skill is ranked above A.
For allies, the skill can give sound advice and provide insight into the enemy’s weakness.

### Sire’s Ill Omen: B

A skill derived from the legends about the swords bearing the Muramasa signature, the so-called “wicked swords of Muramasa.”
The swords created by Senji Muramasa and his school are said to bring misfortune to the leaders of the Tokugawa clan.
In FGO, this skill is used as a special attack against administrators and kings.
