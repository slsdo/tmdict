### Personality

An old man who dedicated his entire life to forging swords. Upon his manifestation, he took on the appearance of a vital young man, but he is mentally closer to his older self. He is brash, does not hesitate, and hardly gives a thought for the consequences of his actions. He is often blunt, and it would be a bit of a stretch to say he is friendly. Though he may initially come off as coldhearted, he is quite caring and even chivalrous when one takes the time to get to know him.

This may be Muramasa himself, but it is at least partly the influence of his vessel’s personality…or it could be that his persona is simply that of his vessel, had the boy grown to be an old man.

He is a workaholic who takes pride in a job well done, no matter who his client is or what the job entails. He may often be ruthless or even cold when it comes to his work, but at the same time he has the integrity to never do heretical work.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He seems to be pushing them away, but in fact, he is watching the master very closely.
If you observe him carefully, without being intimidated by his somewhat abusive words, you will realize that his loudness is more of an outgrowth of his fondness.
It is not that he thinks of the Master as his child or grandchild. At best, they are probably regarded as a neighborhood prankster who often comes to the workshop to play until they’re out of energy and doesn’t go home even after dark but for him, it is a recognition that shows his irreplaceable affection.

### Dialogue Examples

“It’s just an ordinary smithy. It’s where I work”
“What, your guests?”
“Myojinkiri Muramasa. That’s it’s name. I’m sure someone who can hold safely pick it up and swing it around has to exist”
“I don’t need to explain. I’ve just had a bit of a history with them. I don’t want to kill them, but they’re not on my side either. To put it bluntly, they’re rotten.”
“Well, that was an amazing fight! That finishing move was just superb! That British Mage is such a delight!
“Saber, Senji Muramasa. I’ve come in answer to your summons. I used to wonder why I was a Saber but now it more or less makes some sense… Though it has nothing to do with the smoke that I was called up in this manner, but I still went on a rampage with this face, so I’m going to do what I want until I’m satisfied”{{n1}}
What I like? Obviously good sand and fire. I like fish too. And rice balls. I ain’t a drinker though. I do eat dumplings.

### Historical Image · Character Image

A swordsmith from Kuwana of the Ise Province, whose title was Uemon-no-jou during the Bunki Era of Japan. He is considered to be the founder of the swordsmith school famed for forging the sharpest swords of the Warring States period of Japan.

While some documents dating to the Edo period claim the Muramasa school lasted for three generations, from the Jouji Era (1362-1368) to the Ouei Era (1394-1428), the oldest sword confirmed to have come from the Muramasa school was made during the first year of the Bunki Era (1501). For this reason, in this game Muramasa of the Bunki Era will be treated as the founding generation.

During Japan’s Warring States period, when a vast number of swords were made, many renowned swordsmith workshops existed throughout Japan. At times, these swordsmiths would assist the warriors by repairing swords that were damaged during battle. Among these craftsmen, a swordsmith from Kuwana in the Ise Province named Senji Muramasa was known to be a master, and his swords were especially sought after by the warriors of Mikawa.

There is one particular legend about the swords from the Muramasa clan. The legend said that these swords were demonic blades, and they were to bring calamity to the house of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

The sword that killed Ieyasu’s grandfather, Matsudaira Kiyoyasu… The sword that wounded Ieyasu’s father, Hirotada… The blade that beheaded his eldest son, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, during his seppuku ritual… And the sword that wounded Ieyasu himself… All of these were said to have borne the maker’s mark of Muramasa.

Legendary demonic swords that slay the Tokugawa…Muramasa was truly a terrifying blade. Muramasa swords are also often portrayed as blood-soaked demonic blades in several kabuki plays and other narratives, as well as legends the revolve around the adversaries of the Tokugawa clan.

Yui Shousetsu, who plotted to overthrow the Shogunate in 1651 A.D., is said to have owned a Muramasa blade, and Sanada Yukimura is also said to have owned one according to the series of biographies titled “Meisho Kotogiroku.”

During the Boshin War, the governor-general of the University of Tokyo, Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito, is said to have wielded a Muramasa.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

He appears in the “Seven Duels of Swordmasters” as a Heroic Spirit sent by the Counter Force.
In Part 2 he appears as an enemy Servant summoned by the Foreign God, and in Chaldea as a Heroic Spirit of Proper Human History circa 2004 to 2015{{n2}}.
Both are pseudo Servants “Muramasa cast down into the body of a modern person”.
They share the same personality and character, but by their very nature as Servants, they are not identical.
Although there is some “record sharing” between Saber and Caster{{n3}} Muramasa, The record of Senji Muramasa, an Alter Ego, is not registered in the throne but his deeds have been sublimated into a skill.

### Muramasa as an Apostle of the Foreign God

Alter Ego Muramasa only serves the Foreign God as his job and doesn’t see himself as good or evil. He is just a man who wants to do a satisfactory job. Having predicted Kirschtaria’s actions of placing gods from other mythological systems inside the Tree of Emptiness to hinder the descent of the Foreign God he was selected by ■■■■■ as an Apostle with the role of God Slayer.

As predicted, Muramasa bisected the giant god Atlas and became one of the causes of the Foreign God coming to Earth. At that point he expected to be destroyed having served his purpose but due to the naivety of the president of the earth, the destruction of the apostles was postponed, and he was assigned the task of investigating and destroying Lostbelt Britain

“I’ll go along with it if I have to, but I don’t like it at all,” he said.

He attempted to assassinate Morgan in Britain, but was defeated by Fairy Knight(Tam Lim) Lancelot. After that through a series of strange events, he joins the Chaldean party and before the destruction of Britain, he says, “I will finish my work and disappear. Since he was burned in the Sky Furnace his soul didn’t return back to the Throne of Heroes but the results of his work were inherited changing the skill of the Muramasa that was connected to the Master.

#### Miyamoto Musashi

“I was desperate to sever cause and effect, but you pushed forward to cut through the void. What a big fool. It’s only natural that you’ll end up like that, right?”

#### Houzouin Inshun / Minamoto-no-Raikou / Yagyu Tajima-no-kami Munenori

That’s a relief. These ones are as masterful as they sound. It’s amazing that people who have thrown themselves so hard into the martial arts can still act like a decent human beings.

#### Katou Danzo/Fuuma Kotarou

What, they are getting along well? Is that so? Well, this summoning stuff ain’t half bad

#### Jing Ke

It seems that a hero who possessed one of my short swords fell in love with your life. “The winds howl sadly and the waters of the Yi River are frozen. Brave men, once gone, Never come back again.”{{n4}} Saigo-san is a great man, do you know him?{{n5}}

#### EMIYA (Alter)

Stop that you fool! The sword or the gun, make it clear which one you want to live by

#### Ibuki-Douji

What!? You’re saying I can catch that lady with sake!? She’s the incarnation of the divine sword so you’re sure she likes divine wine!? Damn, I’m so worthless. If I had spent my life making sake, would I have made it by now? There must be a Sake God or two in Chaldea right?

#### Rasputin

You’re saying when I was an Alter Ego I fought alongside that guy!? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

#### Altria Caster

She’s a cheerful girl, isn’t she? Sometimes she becomes very polite as if she is a different person, but her roots are the same. The other day, she made me go along with a simulation, saying, “I’m thinking of making a new holy sword, and I’d like you to take a look at it. Please take care of me old man”

#### Oberon

“Can you make a katana with a pure white blade and hilt?” I sent him away because it was a foolish and unreasonable order but since I’ve gone through such great lengths to become a servant I might as well give it a shot
