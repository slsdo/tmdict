### Magic Resistance: A

Nullifies spells of A-Rank or below. In fact he can’t be harmed by modern magi. As a result of the Saber Class and the protection of Santa Claus the rank has increased compared to when he was a Lancer

### Riding: -

After adopting a boxing combat style, he lost his Riding skill, despite being a Saber class. He’s Santa, but he doesn’t ride a sleigh. Being the boxer that he is, all he can do is to silently keep on jogging (roadwork) to train.

### Divinity: A

The fact that he is the son of Surya, the god of sun, does not change even after he has turned into Santa.
“Santa is like the sun to children. So it’s more sensible to say that Surya is Santa,” says Karna rather matter-of-factly in the cafeteria. However, Arjuna, who was eating curry behind him, just looked puzzled when he heard that.

### Hard Puncher: EX

A skill that demonstrates the raw strength of his punches. A deadly strike that can KO an enemy with just a single blow.
