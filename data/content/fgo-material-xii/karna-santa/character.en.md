### Personality

It’s pretty much the same old Karna.

However by switching to a bare-handed martial arts style he now recalls his tough training days and even if only a little, he has started to enjoy martial arts training and the growth it brings.

“I don’t have Indra’s spear, so I’ll just clench my fists and we’ll exchange blows. It’ll be just like those times I used to exchange blows with Ashvatthaman and the others”.

Basically the above.

He wants to train harder, he wants to improve his fighting skills and he wants to fight strong enemies It may look like nothing much has changed, but in some ways he’s gained a younger mentality. He retains his normal level-headedness, but he also sometimes says and does things that make you think he’s a passionate protagonist straight out of a shonen manga.

“I love roadwork”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He has no particular wish for the Holy Grail.

All he wishes for is to complete his job as Santa Claus (while also training his boxing skills) He treats the Master as an advisor who is familiar with Christmas. He knows he lacks common sense so he is going to be relying on them.

### Dialogue Examples

“I didn’t expect to be chosen as Santa but i’ll do my best”
“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Wonderful! What an excellent quote.”
“I’d love to encounter someone stronger than me but I have Santa Business to attend to, so excuse me”
“My fist is my sword now, but you don’t have to do the same. You can use whatever weapon you like.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Karna has become Santa. Because of reasons.

Once a year during Christmastime, everyone wishes for presents. Karna learns Santa Claus is the one who grants these wishes, and the moment he realizes he has the power to do so himself, he does not hesitate to take on the role. And so, whenever the children ask, “Santa, please give me a present,” this new Santa Claus simply replies, “Very well. Here you go,” and grants their Christmas wish. He may seem a bit frosty, but he’s far from coldhearted. He just has a hard time smiling.

Stoic in a way, not over-enthusiastic, not having fun, but perfectly fulfilling the role of Santa.

But by the end of the day when he has fulfilled his duties as Santa and receives a big smile and a “Thank you” from the children he feels a different sort of happiness than when he does his usual charity work.

That’s to be expected. After all he isn’t the usual Karna right now, he is Santa Karna.

For some reason he has taken up the masculine sport of boxing. He is an all-rounder who can do either in-boxing or out-boxing depending on his opponent (or his whims).

In most cases his choice of fighting style is either because “it looks like fun” or “it looks like I can grow stronger” never because “it will be an eazy win” . Sometimes it’s necessary to have a hard fought fistfight.

### General Armaments

Fist

### Connections with Characters

#### Arjuna

Since Karna is closer in mentally to his training days, they are slightly closer than usual.
Although they are “rivals who killed each other in the Great War,” now they are more like “students who studied under the same master”.

#### Ashwatthama

Same as above. This one has more of a delinquent feel to it.
“You still have that spark from when we first met … Heh it’s starting to get fun. Alright I’m in. Let’s go”.

#### Vitra

The enemy of Christmas, the mighty evil dragon.
A being “no weapon can harm” Santa Karna might have born a boxer as a result of that.

#### Duryodhana

The only man who helped me when I was laughed at for my status. A benefactor and a friend.
From the general public’s point of view, he may be an asshole, but I trust and respect him.

#### Romulus=Quirinus

The Roman Branch of the Heracles school is a rival.
