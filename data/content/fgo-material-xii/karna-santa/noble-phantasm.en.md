Winning Arkaputra
Santa Karna’s finishing combo. After quickly bobbing and weaving to keep his opponent off target, Karna steps in with a series of left and right hooks, followed by two left jabs and a straight right, then finishes with an uppercut to send his opponent flying.
These blows are obviously filled with the power of Santa and the power of the son of Surya. What should be especially noted, is that when he strikes with his finishing uppercut, the excess energy he has manifests into feathers of light and a divine halo. The combination of these powers is beyond galactic comprehension, and his opponents claim to feel like they were struck by a meteor. They immediately drop onto the mat.

The word “Arkaputra” is Karna’s other name, meaning “the sun’s son.”

Graharaja Santa Claus
A one-hit killing cross counterpunch developed by Karna as his finishing blow. In addition to Karna having been inspired by boxing the moment he became Santa, Karna learned that boxing has a knockout punch called a cross counter, and for some reason Karna came to the conclusion that “Santa uses a cross counter as his finishing blow, which must be why he is named Santa Claus!” This utterly nonsensical notion is what led to him coming up with this technique.
It is not possible to actually see this attack. His fist perfectly aligns with the enemy’s strike and smashes through the enemy’s jaw like a beam of sunlight. It’s as if a sacred sword of the stars slashed through the air… This move is both a deadly fist and a sacred sword.

The word “Graharaja” means “lord of the planets,” and it is another name for the sun god Surya.
