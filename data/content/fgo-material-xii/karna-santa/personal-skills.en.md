### Footwork Santa: A

An astounding skill that combines footwork and being Santa, and it is the foundation of Santa Karna’s fighting style. It’s a skill that demonstrates footwork and stepping techniques in boxing that not only maintains appropriate distances for various situations, evading attacks, and finding even the slightest openings in enemies’ defenses, but it also allows him to trek as Santa Claus to ensure that he can deliver gifts to anybody, even in dangerous places such as lava fields or areas with heavy snowfall.

### Flash Fist: A

This Karna does not wield a spear. The only thing he wields is his fists, but that doesn’t mean his combat prowess has declined. Because he was trained by Drona, his master who was gifted in all forms of martial arts, he is accustomed to fighting barehanded. In fact, his memories of training with Arjuna and Aśvatthāman brought out a new sensation for him, and it has made him feel lighter than when he wields his spear.
His hand speed exceeds the speed of light, and those who face it can only see his fist as a trail of light…probably. His fists are as keen as a true blade.
“And that’s why I’m a Saber, right?” says Santa proudly at the cafeteria. However, Aśvatthāman, who was eating a piece of chicken behind him, just looked puzzled when he heard that.

### Hero of Benefaction (Holy Night): EX

One of the reasons Karna was chosen to be Santa Claus. If the hero who always gives generously when asked, is given a mysterious gift bag filled with Santa Power then we have nothing to fear anymore. Well, it’s not like there’s much to be scared of anyway. A skill of similar nature to “Saint’s Gift”.
