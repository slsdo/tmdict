A single strike that specializes in killing demons, particularly oni.
Watanabe-no-Tsuna was by no means a mage, but whenever he is in the presence of oni, he performs a kuji-kiri chant to heighten his power and focus, enabling him to kill oni in one strike.
Unlike Raikou or Kintoki, he fights oni while remaining entirely human.
It is especially effective against demon-related things, and granted even more power when wielded against oni-kind.

A famed sword of the Genji clan, entrusted to Tsuna by Raikou. Its previous name was Higekiri, and it was also said to be used during the battle against Suzuka Gozen. After it sliced off Ibaraki-Douji’s arm, it was renamed Onikiri (oni-slayer). The sword possesses special properties when used against demonic enemies and oni. Just by virtue of seeing it unsheathed, oni-kind experience an unconditional force of B-rank or higher.
In FGO, this is only used as a normal weapon.
