Watanabe no Tsuna. Although heâ€™s a justifiably well-known person in Japan, when I got the request, I really wanted to draw him with a two-block bowl cut{{n1}}, in part because of his character, and also because of my personal brainworm at the time. With that in mind, I started with his hairdo, and the rest of the design grew from there. For the clothing, I used traditional Heian-period articles as reference, so the mismatch between the hairstyle and the clothes worked as a sort of contrast accent, I think. (Hidari)
