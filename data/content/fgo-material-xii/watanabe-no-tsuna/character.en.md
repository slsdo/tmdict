### Personality

A person of character well suited to be at the top of Minamoto no Raikou’s Four Heavenly Kings.
He may be a man of few words, but he is still social, and was a renowned as a cool and collected oni killer. He executes his job with such flawlessness and dogged dedication that outsiders can hardly imagine him ever having a personal or social life. People around him placed absolute trust in him not because of his words, but rather his attitude and the way he carried himself.

### Attitude towards Master

Perhaps as some sort of remnant of being part of the Four Heavenly Kings, he basically just treats his Master like their a younger sibling. He might be untalkative, but he behaves in an affectionate manner nonetheless.

On the other hand, should the Master have a contract with an oni like Ibaraki, Tsuna’s respect for them will skyrocket. This is because it’s something Tsuna himself could never have done during the Heian period.

### Dialogue Examples

“Once I unsheathe it, I just have to swing it. I see no issue there.”
“If you ask me, it’s much harder to slice up humans than oni or demonic beings, but not many seem to agree with me… Even Kintoki looks at me like I’m some crazy person…”
“My duty is simply to cut things up.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A samurai active during the mid-Heian period.
As one of Minamoto no Raikou’s retainers, he, along with Sakata Kintoki, Usui Sadamitsu and Urabe no Suetake, were known as the Four Heavenly Kings of Yorimitsu.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Legends change. They twist and turn. Even the order of events might change.
That’s just how it is.

For Watanabe no Tsuna, head of the Four Heavenly Kings, oni-kind were things to cut slaughter, and he harbored neither compassion nor mercy for them. They assaulted people, abducted them, even ate them. And so, as a samurai devoted to protecting people, Tsuna wielded his blade with extraordinary skill.

───I guess you could call it an act of justice.

He was given patronage by Raikou and was proclaimed head of the Four Heavenly Kings. As time passed, more and more people came to idolize him, as one would an elder brother.

───The heart thirsts like the desert. The body sharpens like the blade.

Kyoto was most assuredly the capital of madness, a world of the latter days of law where monsters of land and sea alike ran rampant amidst anarchy.
Tsuna never hesitated in wielding his blade. He never hesitated in slaughtering oni.
He simply made it his one and only duty to kill the demonic.
Detached. Dispassionate.
When was it that hatred began to cloud his slash?
When was it his end began?

Was it when the woman for whom he yearned since time immemorial, and with whom he was supposed to live happily ever after, was found mercilessly murdered?

───Ibaraki.

Their confrontation was inevitable. An oni who had proclaimed themselves cheiftain, assembling the oni.
Their name was Ibaraki Douji. Abe no Seimei had prophecised that Ibaraki, who had her arm cut off at Ichijou Modori-bashi, would come after Tsuna.
And just as expected, Ibaraki Douji came for Tsuna. Imitating the form of that woman, she wished for her arm back.

───That face…

Taking advantage of that momentary surprise, Ibaraki Douji managed to take her arm back.
The delighted girl then locked eyes with Tsuna.
The yearning for days past, the hatred for oni-kind, and all the he had ever seen or heard rumored about that peculiar figure, came together in a single phrase: “Take it, Ibaraki.”

───Did that person…raise an oni?

“Next time, I will slay you.”
However, even as he pledged this, Tsuna’s blade unconsciously grew dull.
Although Raikou reprimanded him, restoring his previous skill with the blade, his heart was forever left behind.

───Whence does an oni’s wickedness spur?

Oni are evil, she was evil, and Ibarai Douji, who walks the boundary between human and oni, is evil. Shuten Douji is evil for turning her back into an oni. And perhaps, Tsuna too is evil for allowing it.
However───life could not have been any other way.
They are the way they are because they are meant to be so, and for that reason, he had no choice but to slay them.
At the final battle at Mount Ooe, Tsuna brandished the oni-slaying Yasutsuna as he cut down Ibaraki Douji’s subordinates—her companions—one after another; cutting and cutting and cutting.

In the distant future, those referred to as “Sword Demons”{{n1}} would appear throughout history, but it is said that Watanabe no Tsuna, when he appeared on the mountain that day, was no demon; he was an Asura.

And so, in the end───
Ibaraki Douji and Watanabe no Tsuna came eye to eye.
Was Tsuna able to cut down Ibaraki? Was he able to kill her?
Or was it, as later generations have told, that there was simply a strife and rioting in order to retrieve the arm?
(In the “Zentaiheiki” and “Tale of the Heike” it is written that it was after the battle at Mount Ooe that Ibaraki Douji started riots to regain her arm.)

Tsuna will not speak of it under any circumstance.

“Ah───I always feel sick in this very moment”

### In Naraka Mandala Heian-kyō

In that Holy Grail War wherein all the Servants summoned were of the Caster class, he summoned Medea Lily. Utilizing her as a support unit, it was he who carried out battles.
Out of the Four Heavenly Kings present, he managed to defeat Usui Sadamitsu and Urabe no Suetake.
(Note that the two were defeated, not necessarily killed)

Later on, he was in turn defeated by Kintoki and the Master of Chaldea. At that point, he thus gave up on the Holy Grail, and thereafter turned ally.

The wish he had for the Holy Grail was to bring back the woman he once yearned for.
He understood very well that it was a most selfish wish, but that would not stop him.

### General Armaments

Oni-Slaying Yasutsuna.
A treasured blade once gifted to him by Raikou…
One of the most famous swords to exist, known for severing the arm of Ibaraki Douji.

### Connections with Characters

#### Ibaraki Douji

An oni keeping alive the countenance of the woman he once yearned for…
For that reason, his heart all but bursts at the seams upon seeing that child leading a happy life.
At the same time, he understands that this is all hanging on by a thin thread, and that as long as she remains an oni, he will one day have to cut her down.

#### Minamoto no Raikou

His boss, for who he holds much respect…
Despite her being a Berserker, he trusts her sense of reason and intelligence without so much as a shadow of doubt.
That said, when it comes to Master or Kintoki, she gets very troublesome, so Tsuna has mastered the art of dodging questions.

#### Sakata Kintoki

“Knowledge of the modern day has informed me that your attire is what they would call befitting of a delinquent. What a shocker.”

#### Shuten Douji

It was because of her that Ibaraki finally became an oni…
Still, he understands that had she not become an oni, she would have eventually succumbed to the friction with the human world.
His true feelings on the matter are very complex.

#### Fuuma Kotarou / Tomoe Gozen, etc.

If they are oni, he will cut them down.
If they are not oni, he will not cut them down.
The logic behind his actions is simple.

#### Medea Lily

The Tsuna summoned to Chaldea has no recollection of the events in “Hell Realm Mandala, Heian-Kyo”.
Even so, he understands the situation well enough;
She has a happy relationship with Jason.

#### Jason

Later on, he received a complaint to “Please stop trying to stir stuff up, man, jeez!”
He couldn’t comprehend it, since he assumed the two were mutually in love.
“You’re in love, aren’t you? Oh, I see now.”
