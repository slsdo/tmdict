### Eternal Arms Mastery (Anti-Demonic): A-

So long as his opponent is demonic, his swordsmanship will not waver in the slightest.
He is an expert at fighting oni and demons, but due to...certain circumstances, this skill has been slightly downgraded.

### Varuna’s Disciple: B

There is a theory that Tsuna, as the ancestor of the Watanabe clan, practiced the art of pacifying water spirits and preventing water-related disasters.
He is able to both protect himself against threats from water, and pacify its spirits at the same time.

### Severed Arm at Ichijou Modori-bashi: EX

The legend of what happened at Ichijou Modori-bashi at the capital, sublimated into a skill. Tsuna demonstrated incredible prowess by facing an oni, whose supernatural strength should have made it more than a match for a human. According to legend, he sliced off the oni’s arm without so much as flinching. This skill makes his attack impossible to anticipate, and so equally impossible to evade.

Basing his attacks on the above as an origin point, it means his initial attack is highly likely to get the job done right away. Should they manage to counterattack, it’s not so special anymore.
