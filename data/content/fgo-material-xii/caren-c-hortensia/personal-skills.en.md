### Shroud of Valentinus: A

Eros (the love of the flesh)
Usually, Caren prefers her trusty “Shroud of Magdalene”, but now she uses the shroud of lovers instead.
It applies invincibility to herself and her allies.
However, the ally it is applied to will have to pay Caren with their NP gauge for the next 3 turns.

### Golden Arrow: A

Philia (the love of one’s friends)
Angelic arrows that en-Amor-s whomever they pierce. Forcibly.
Applies taunt to herself in addition to draining the enemies’ NP while applying attack down and defense down to them.

### Mana Discharge (Love): A

Storge (the love of one’s family)
Also known as God Caren.
Super buff that Caren calls forth for the sake of that which she loves and watches over more than anything else.
Seems vaguely amazing. Oh, and it drains NP from her opponent. Basically, all her skills drain NP from the opponent.
