Caren C. Hortensia is like if the Gods of Love from each mythology assembled inside of one human vessel. By letting this very crazy lore come together with these gods’ crazy divinities, our rather quirky Missionary of Love was born. Separate from such mankind-scale love, she is actually a nun with who holds a different love deep within her heart. I have some memories of sending in a variety of design proposal, gradually refining each of the “forms of love” she represents. I had been instructed to make the first ascension easily identifiable as Cupid, so I added and removed a bunch of accessories, scarfs, and other things until eventually settling on the current outfit. I also had been ordered to make the paper bag, and baby stuff that had appeared in previous works, so I made sure that was reflected in her sprites. (Morii Shizuki)
