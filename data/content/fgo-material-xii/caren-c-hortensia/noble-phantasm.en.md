The Greatest Hits: “Calling Agape”.
Universal, Unconditional and Unlimited Love.

Noble Phantasm of Ascension.
Caren wreathes herself in a shell of prayers, and then completes her theophany as the mouthpiece of a yet newer and more universal love.
Instead of the Love God Amor themselves, she becomes a “love from heaven” based on Amor, and delivers an attack of divine punishment by lighting up the earth with her unconditional and unlimited love.
It’s unmistakably an Anti-World Noble Phantasm, but its user stubbornly insists that it’s an Anti-Personnel one.
The love that Caren speaks of is that of God’s unconditional love for man.
Thus, Agape.

In Tiger Colosseum, Caren previously used a morningstar with a weight that depended on how much love its wielder had. Seeing as Caren loves all of humanity, the hammer’s weight was the same as the earth. This Noble Phantasm is the F/GO version of that.

The beam of love is what’s “unlimited”, and Caren’s magnanimity in giving it out for free is what’s “unconditional”.
