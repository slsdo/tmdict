The fundamental motif of her design is based on Rambha, the celestial nymph who was seduced by Vritra (not sure about that), so I made her beautiful, yet made her slightly mysterious by having her hide her mouth in the first ascension, which is a characteristic of Vritra. As long as she doesn’t open her mouth, she’s so beautiful! In that sense, my favorite part of her design is her expressions. Since she was originally an evil dragon, I gave her pretty blunt expressions. I also designed her with the intent that she would be even more attractive in motion. In fact, when she actually appeared in the story, she moved with such a carefree attitude and was more dazzling than I could have ever imagined. (La-na)
