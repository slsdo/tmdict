Asura Shrestha.
A Noble Phantasm that refers to Vritra’s other name, “the greatest among the Asuras.” She uses an army of demons which are either her kin or her own alter egos, and covers the heavens and earth, exactly as her reason for existence dictates, isolating the target. According to legend, “Vritra used her own body to dam water up in the mountains”. The “mountains” here can be interpreted as “clouds”, and so this Noble Phantasm takes the form of an ominous cloud that blankets and then crashes down onto the world.

In addition to being an evil dragon, Vritra is also described as an Asura (demon), and is also called Asurendra (king of the Asuras). In the “Mahabharata,” an army of malevolent demigods like Kalakeyas and Rakshasas led by Vritra were described as having tormented Indra and the gods, and so she not only has the authority to “obstruct things”, but also wields control over armies of pure violence.
