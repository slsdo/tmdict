### Fated Enemy of the Gods: A

Although Vritra has been spoken of in various forms in legends, her role has always remained the same. A skill that demonstrates her eternal position and raison d’être as an existence opposing the gods.
Another name for Vritra, “Surāri”, is said to mean “enemy of the gods”.

### The Vajra that Penetrated: A

Although the details vary from legend to legend, many of them recount that Vritra was slain by the very weapon she now wields herself (the Vajra). Some stories also exist where Vritra was slain by shooting the Vajra into her mouth as she held it wide open.
As a Servant, Vritra has come to possess the Vajra which was the very cause of her death. Of course, saying it’s the “very same” might not be entirely correct, since its shape and properties might have altered somewhat, but it’s still modeled after the same one used by Indra.
Even in its current form, having been transformed into a spear, it remains endowed with the strength and destructive power of a Divine Construct.
As for the reason behind using the weapon of an enemy…perhaps it’s for the sake of not forgetting the anguish bestowed upon her by her bitter enemy? Or perhaps, she flourishes it now as a spear of evil as a form of harassment to ridicule her enemy?

### Eternally Indestructible Demon: EX

Even if she is defeated by Indra, after some time she will revive once again and begin a battle against the gods.
A skill that demonstrates that eternal cycle, that nature of indestructibility that could even be likened to a natural phenomenon.
The confrontation between “Vritra who stems waters (by bringing about droughts or trapping it in the clouds and mountains)” and “Indra who unleashes that with thunderstorms” is not a one-time occasion; it is something that’s been repeating since the distant past and will probably repeat eternally in the future as well.
That is, perhaps, the very primordial faith that reveres nature and the gods.
Vritra reigns as an indestructible demon with the same intensity as the reverence towards nature that the people pour into the gods.
