### Personality

Broadminded. Someone who nonchalantly laughs off minor details. At first glance, she seems like a good-natured person. Tolerant, humane, and trustworthy. However, the truth is that her sensitivities are far detached from human sensitivities. With enough time, or perhaps just a longer conversation, you’ll notice that she is fundamentally different from human beings. She is not human.

She doesn’t understand in detail how the human species conducts itself. Despite this incomplete understanding, whenever she feels like it, she listens to the tiny, frail beings, or cultivates individuals with latent talent, like Ushiwakamaru. She doesn’t understand humans quite well, but she is “fond” of humans. In the same way she is “fond” of bugs and animals.

She loves parties. Her signature verbal tic is their loud, boisterous laughter.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Kiichi Hougen has no wish for the Holy Grail.

If anything, having another face as a Great Tengu, Kiichi Hougen is the one granting people’s wishes.

### Dialogue Examples

Kaahahahaha!
Kiichi Hougen, manifested in the Assassin Class! I’d rather be a Lancer, but nonetheless, splendid, splendid!
Splendid! Yes, splendid!
I am the teacher of all lands and eras.
You’re the pupil and I’m the teacher. No objections, right?

### Historical Image · Character Image

An onmyouji monk and strategist. A figure described in legend as the founder of the Kyouhachi-ryuu, the oldest school of swordsmanship in West Japan.

Kiichi Hougen is a supernatural entity frequently syncretized with Kurama Tengu, the Great Tengu - Soujoubou of Mt. Kurama. The Edo period puppet play Kiichi Hougen Sanryaku-kan notes that Kiichi Hougen is actually the Tengu of Mt. Kurama, Soujoubou.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She taught combat to the young Ushiwakamaru, and enabled her to learn the innermost secrets of war strategy: the Six Secret Teachings and the Three Strategies of Huang Shigong… entirely against her will. Ushiwakamaru just seduced her daughter one day to sneak a look at the secrets, causing the fearsome mentor to try to kill her in rage. She goes by the name Kiichi Hougen, but her real identity is…

Kiichi Hougen is not human. She is a Great Tengu.

Tengus are a species of Spirits affiliated with parts of nature, such as mountains, skies, wind, or fire. They’re very different from Divine Spirits, but if anything, they’re closer to Divine Spirits than to humans. Although they normally don’t interact with humans, that’s not a hard rule, as shown by the examples of Ushiwakamaru and the Kyouhachi-ryuu disciples. She has a clear precedent of coming in contact with humans and granting them something. She granted advanced knowledge and techniques for martial and arcane arts alike… but that’s not the only thing she can grant. If you do something that offends her, you’ll be literally sent to hell. For a Tengu as grand as the Soujoubou of Mt. Kurama can effortlessly open the gates of hell.

<>

Side note: She’ll get unreasonably angry if you ask “Who is stronger, you or Taroubou Tengu of Mt. Atago?”

I might be uncomfortable to mention Taroubou, considered the greatest Tengu of Japan, to someone you already heard calling themselves “Japan’s strongest Tengu” once.

### General Armaments

A naginata.
One story tells she taught Ushiwakamaru how to fight with a naginata.

### Others

Expanding on the comment about her body: the gender section written like that because their gender and physique are freely transformable. Their current form is their most frequently used one, but it’s not their most majestic one, from what it seems.

### Connections with Characters

#### Ushiwakamaru

I already told you I’m not personally angry.

Be better, Shanaou!

It’s terrifying how good listeners the writers are.

Come on, don’t feel so dispirited.
I may not be the exact Sanat Kumara you spoke of, but you know, what you say makes some modicum of sen-
Whoa, your eyes lit up a lot!
Calm down!

Hey, Western Mentor!
