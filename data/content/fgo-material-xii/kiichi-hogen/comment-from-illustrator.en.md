Since she is Ushiwakamaru’s teacher, I started the design with a crow tengu theme. At first, she was a crow tengu with a black color scheme, but halfway through it, I did a hard 180, and before I knew it, her primary color was white and she was wearing an outfit that made no sense for her era… Her horn is removable and, in my headcanon, something she’s only growing because she thinks it’s cool. She’s a free-spirited shapeshifter, and that’s a point that makes me want to offer a lot of different new ideas for her art. (Oomori Aoi)
