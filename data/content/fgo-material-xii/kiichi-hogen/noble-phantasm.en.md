An Usen is a fan made of feathers, usually from hawks or eagles.
It’s usually a tool used to command troops, but at the same time, they appear in legends and paintings as arcane Noble Phantasms used by Tengus and Xians - tools containing vast amounts of supernatural power.

The well-known Tengu fans. Assassin Kiichi Hougen uses one of those feather fans as her Noble Phantasm.

Putting its destructive power in one word, that word would be “tremendous”. It’s a Noble Phantasm that better embodies her properties as Kurama Tengu, the Great Tengu more commonly known as Soujoubou of Mt. Kurama, rather than Kiichi Hougen, the onmyouji and strategist. The winds released with its True Name reach the level of storms, cataclysm that shake the earth and split mountains.
