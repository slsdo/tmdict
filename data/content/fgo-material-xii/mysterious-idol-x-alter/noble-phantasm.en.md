Lumino Calibur
It is the forbidden guitar blade “Evil Lumino Calibur Strings,” said to be playable only by those who formed a contract with the demon of music (it was actually on clearance at Planet Chamizu). The honed Idol☆Glo Points that trigger super feels change the battlefield into a stage with glittering, flashing lights.
