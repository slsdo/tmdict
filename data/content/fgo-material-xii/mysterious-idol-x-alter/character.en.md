### Personality

Even though her aloof demeanor and tone of voice haven’t changed much from her villainous Berserker form, she has loosened up a bit. She even smiles now, and sometimes actually makes jokes. Her desire to please and entertain others has surfaced, but she also allows her weakness and frustrations to show. She was surprised to learn that she had many emotions, which were simply in the way when she was just wielding her sword, and has come to realize that these feelings could be applied to writing music and lyrics. She is starting to realize that, instead of relying on terror and violence as she did in her villain days, maybe she should be more honest about her own feelings if it means she could move people through song and music…

Even though she has become an idol, her biggest weak point is still her lifelong rival, the Mysterious Heroine X. Echan watches her every move. It’s not like she wants to get along, she just wants X’s admiration and to be a good rival.
A past interaction with Heroine X triggered something within her and for X Alter, who never really cared about other people’s feelings before, being praised for her songs, influencing each other as singer and listener, and creating an emotional response was a delightful experience. If someone were to destroy such a simple joy with violence, it would be like looking at the inhuman me of the past. I would cringe so hard I wouldn’t be able to deal with them.

### Attitude towards Master

Master is a reliable producer. He cares about me as an idol and always brings out my best performance.
Even if I am not perfect, I want to live up to his expectations, even if it is just a small step at a time.

### Dialogue Examples

“Yeah, I’m Mysterious Idol X (Alter). The Idol Echan belong to Chaldea Production. Please take care of me Mast……, no MasP-san”
“The live performance of the fierce battle is about to begin.”
“Jump and dance my heart”
“Encores over…… Ankoromochi”
“Ex-stream~”
“As long as Master is there, than that place is the concert hall”
“Just as you can’t stay alive without your heart there are some Japanese sweets I can’t do without. Don’t get it wrong, I’m not a glutton”
“The great moonlit river…so luminous! Be it the divine voice from the underworld…it will still be harmonious! Hear the song of my sword!”
“Did you watch? You listened but did it touch your heart? Beyond the sky, on the other side of the blue glow, you are surely shining too. My friend”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The one who wandered into the Singularity where idols reign supreme was, in essence, the theatrical version of Ex. She is a little more emotional and active than the normal version, and it costs more to draw her.
She is a singing Foreigner who wants it all, as she handles the writing for both music and lyrics, singing and performing, and even fighting in battles!
But if you want to go further back, the original Mysterious Heroine X (Alter) originates from a reality TV show that was somewhat popular in the Servant Universe. In season 1, the School Arc, she formed an alliance with Mysterious Heroine X, while in season 2, the Villain Arc, she was a part of the Villains Coalition while striving to revive the Dark Rounds. The story in this theatrical release is a special episode that happened between these two seasons, wherein certain circumstances have led her to try being the Universe’s top idol…
Well… Okay, yeah. One can only tolerate so many stories about galactic battles against moon-walking space robots…

### General Armaments

Evil Lumino Calibur Strings.
The floating pod Little Black Knight is an independent platform. Its wicked comebacks now play in stereo!

### Connections with Characters

#### Miss Crane

She is a miraculous person who created a unique outfit that can only be worn by me.
It wouldn’t be wrong to call her a villain would it? Anyway I have to make sure I repay her.

#### Medb and Tamamo Cat

That’s right. They are important friends and great rivals. Are they doing well under the sky of a different space-time? As for me I’m still singing today.

#### Mysterious Heroine XX

Sometimes I invite her to join me for snack time (she usually turns me down though, but that’s okay). It’s interesting to watch XX and her somewhat suspicious behaviour. During moments like that is when I’m glad I came to Chaldea.
