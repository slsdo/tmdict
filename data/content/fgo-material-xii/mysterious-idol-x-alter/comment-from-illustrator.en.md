Idol Echan, but she's also a singer-songwriter that was the image I had in mind when designing her. The basic outfit is white in contrast to the usual Alter image, while her other outfit, designed in the image of a diva, is black. I was excited to put my daughter in a normal idol outfit but that hat might have been a bit too much (laughs) (BUNBUN)
