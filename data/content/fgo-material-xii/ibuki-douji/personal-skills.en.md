A composite skill containing the effects of the Superhuman Strength skill.
Ibuki-douji possesses this skill at a high rank.

### Eight Veins of Surging Waves: B

A skill gained from inheriting the nature of Yamata-no-Orochi as the god of floods, which is one of its aspects as a god.
Her immutable body filled with intense aggression will destroy everything.

### Fingertips of Impurity: A

Purity will be lost, honor will be absent and, finally, death shall arrive.
Those touched by Ibuki-doujiâ€™s fingertips will become impure, no longer allowed to show themselves before the gods or humans.
It is classified as an offensive skill, but it also grants bonus effects when conversing with spirits of the dead, demonic beasts, or fallen gods outside combat.
