First, I started with the image of “a tanned dragon lady” and when I suggested that it would be fun if she was around 3 meters tall at the meeting with TYPE-MOON-san, they gave me the OK right away. I wanted her forms to differ with each ascension so I drew the first ascension to give off the impression of being her juvenile form and her second and third ascensions to be the adult form. In particular, I designed the second ascension with the image of “a 3 meters tall big sis strolling through the shopping district downtown to look for snacks to eat while drinking”. Also known as “the Calamity Lady of Downtown (Disaster Woman)”; having such a motif of her in my mind, I kept working on the design. An alcohol-loving and somewhat sloppy god of calamity is cute.
