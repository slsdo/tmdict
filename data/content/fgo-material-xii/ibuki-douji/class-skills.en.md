She's not supposed to be able to ride those of the Phantasmal Species, but, as an exceptional case, she is able to ride one if she can get along with them.

### Dragon-kind: EX

A skill indicating that one is a born dragon.
Ibuki-douji who is endowed with the Saint Graph that strongly expresses her facet as the child of Yamata-no-Orochi, possesses the skill at an out-of-the-norm rank.

### Divine Core of the Serpent God: A

A composite skill containing the Divinity skill.
Since, according to the legends, she is of mixed-blood with one of her parents being a human, it should be difficult for her to possess a Divine Core, howeverâ€¦having come into existence as the child (bunrei) of Yamata-no-Orochi, Ibuki-douji possesses this skill at a high rank as an exceptional case.
If she were to degrade into an oni, she would lose this skill and it would probably be replaced by a low-rank Divinity skill.
