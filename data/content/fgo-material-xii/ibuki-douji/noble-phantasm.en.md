Shinken - Kusanagi-no-Tachi.
According to the Susanoo myths from the Kojiki and Nihon-shoki, Susanoo-no-Mikoto, having been exiled from Takamagahara, descended upon the province of Izumo and saved Kusanadahime by exterminating the enormous monster she was offered to as a sacrifice.
That monster was a red-eyed apparition with eight heads and eight tails───a gigantic snake that boasted a length spanning eight valleys and eight peaks.
It was Japan’s greatest dragon of calamity.

Having defeated this large serpent (dragon), Susanoo-no-Mikoto obtained a divine sword from its tail.
The sword’s name was Kusanagi-no-Tachi. It was also known as Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi, Ama-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi, and Tsumugari-no-Tachi. They say it was later offered to the Atsuta Shrine and was designated as one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan.

This divine sword that was within her father, Yamato-no-Orochi’s body is what Ibuki-douji uses as a Noble Phantasm.
It is such a fearsome weapon that a single swing from it upon the release of its True Name can blow away eight valleys and eight peaks, and give birth to eight great rivers…however. According to Ibuki-douji, this is nothing but her borrowing the slightest of the divine sword’s gleams for just a moment. Its true worth does not amount to something of this level, is what she means.
