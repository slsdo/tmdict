Ten-i Muhou, Tsuru no Enishi Namida no Wakare.
A supreme piece of clothing woven with all her heart and soul. This Noble Phantasm (temporarily) manifests the ideal clothing all tailors and fashion designers seek to create. The sheer perfection of it is beyond human comprehension, and its beauty and comfort are on par with the Japanese celestial maiden’s legend of the “Hagoromo.” It is the very epitome of innocence.

The power this clothing possesses is quite simple: it offers hope to the wearer. That is all. Hope, hope, and more hope. So long as they have hope in their hearts, people can continue on, overcoming fear and adversity of any sort. At least, the clothing gives the wearer cause to believe so.

But creating clothing of that caliber can also be very draining to the creator. Once her masterpiece clothes your form, you are bound to realize: ah, she has flown away, beyond the sunset, leaving a memento of herself…
