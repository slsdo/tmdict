### Personality

Good, kind, polite. Above all, she is loyal. She always repays favours and does the best she can.
She has a gentle sociability and can quickly establish a comfortable atmosphere, even when meeting people for the first time. However when it comes to idols and clothing she tends to go overboard despite her self-restraint.

### Attitude towards Master

Affectionate, playful and loyal.
She is reserved, but not passive. Tends to go all out if it’s for Master’s sake. Good at all household chores, a hard worker who spares no effort.
However, she do not approve of participating in evil or cruelty, and if forced to do so, will leave out of grief.

### Dialogue Examples

“You showed me kindness, so I’ll devote everything I have to you”
“I have received your order. A dress that will make you shine, I’ll certainly have it made and delivered to you”
“Now, stick your chest out and lift your head. Oh, Excellant! It suits you well. …… Hey, you look great. Don’t worry. You’ll be fine.”
“New stage clothes!? By tomorrow? Understood, I’ll make them! Hmm, this is so exciting! It is my élan vital”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Her origins aren’t human.
As the person themselves say they are an ‘animal’ that has taken the form of a human by chance. In China, they are the so-called ‘crane who had come to repay a favour’, and in Japan they are depicted in folk tales such as ‘Kaima’ and ‘Onna’.
The way these stories usually go is that a kind person saves the crane from a trap and the crane repays the favour by taking the form of a human being. The target of the repayment may be an old couple or a young man, depending on the local tradition. When the target is a young man she repays him by becoming his wife adding an element of inter-species marriage to the tale. The crane weaves fabrics from its own feathers, bringing great wealth to the object of its gratitude, but is forced to leave when it is seen in its true form.
In the Muromachi period picture scroll, Tsuru no Zoshi, the crane becomes the wife of the young man, but the way of repaying the favor is different, and there is no element of weaving in the tale. In this story the wife gives the young man a monster called “Wasawai” in order to get revenge for the unreasonable demands of those in power.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A peculiar big sister type crane who puts her all into making clothes and promoting idols either with pure hearted honesty or passion without ambition.

She has encountered three wishes so far.

Paris. A Master and a friend who i shared happiness and sorrow with. The name of the wish i received was ‘clothing’ and I became absolutely absorbed with them. But she is gone.

Chaldea. The gentle Romani Archaman gave me room and rest. The name of the wish I received was ‘idol’ and I became addicted to them But he too is gone.

The Micro Singularity Moonlight Epitaph.
Confused by the Holy Grail, i twisted my two wishes into an eternal stage. However the Master of Chaldea and Echan stopped that mistake.

And thought me my last wish.
Thank you Good bye and I’ll see you soon.

……Hi I’m back!.
Miss Crane’s Costume Shop is now open 24/7.
It seems that there are a lot of visitors, not only because they sell spiritrion dresses, but also because they easily respond to all fashion-related concerns.
In terms of payment she is too lax (she doesn’t even ask for the bills), so a kind Servant who couldn’t stand that ended up becoming her backer.

At the end of her studies she obtained the skill “The Crane’s Hidden Measuring” the ability to take measurements in a split second of visual inspection. However when actually making clothes she always uses a tape measure to be cautious. If she wanted to she could easily determine someone’s measurements from a picture and cut out the fabric without using pattern paper. However she doesn’t like doing that as she thinks it “lacks sincerity”.

As her stat values show, Miss Crane’s direct combat skills are low.
Her skills as a Caster are also nothing to write home about.
Her Noble Phantasms’ ability is just to produce nice clothes.
If she were summoned in a normal Holy Grail War, it would be extremely difficult to hope for victory.
Buf if you want someone to support you If you want hope to move forward She will be there for you as your greatest companion Even if she disappears there will be a brocade outfit there to inspire you.

#### Romani Archaman

I must apologize to you. The truth we pursued together: ‘What is an idol?’
This philosophical question still has no definitive answer. After all, there are too many incredibly dazzling idols.
They’re all different! They’re all charming!
There is no single ‘correct’ answer!
Ah, of course, I know very well that you are a devoted fan of the super strong, fiery, and magical Mari-chan.
We’ll surely continue this conversation someday.
