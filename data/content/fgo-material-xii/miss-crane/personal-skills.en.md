### Lady’s Affection for Garments: EX

Proof of her love of all types of clothing. Even should it be a garment made without heart, her lightest touch will set it ablaze with the joy of life.

### Overnight Haori: B

Instantly deploys a Bounded Field atelier, allowing her to lose herself in her work. At the same time, her passionate drive to create great pieces also burns the life out of her.

### Thousand-Year Gratitude: A

Her gratitude for any kindness received will never be forgotten. Even after a thousand years, the sentiment neither disappears nor fades; it will remain as strong as the day she experienced that kindness. And now is the time to offer myself to return the favor.

### The Crane’s Hidden Measuring: A

The ability to instantly take the measurements of anyone she lays eyes on even over their clothes and immediately calculate all the correct values in relation to their body shape. This is important personal information and will NOT be disclosed. The dimensions and weight of fabric can also be identified at a glance.
Since it’s a skill used for tailoring in peacetime. It is not used in “FateGO”.
