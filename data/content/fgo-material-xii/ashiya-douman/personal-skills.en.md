### Ridicule Cat: EX

An evolution of the Subversive Activities Skill. Alterego Ashiya Douman, crowned with the sun of treason, can sabotage any society with his fingertips.

### Dark Life: A

Ashiya Douman never dies, instead ressurecting indefinitely to operate behind the scenes. This Skill is a combination of the Act of Life Continuation Skill that a normal Heroic Spirit Ashiya Douman would have, his secret arts of life restoration, and the power of Chernobog, the dark god of the Slavs.
The Act of Life Continuation is one of Hakudou Jounin’s secret arts, which Abe no Seimei uses in Abe no Seimei Monogatari, but the Servant version of Ashiya Douman secretly learned it and developed his own twist on the spell. By converting himself entirely into malignant information, then copying and multiplying his data body, he created a malison that makes him effectively unkillable.

### Douman’s Incantations: A++

The Skill expressing his multiple supernatural techniques, including: curses, hexes, onmyoudou, and houjutsu.
Douman brags about how, as a descendant of Ashiya no Sukune, he learned even the most powerful Xian Arts taught by India’s Houdou Jounin of the Vulture Peak, but further details are not yet revealed (he says that he can connect to the Privileged Domains of the Philosophy Foundation through falsified Philosophy Keys to utilise his ultimate Xian Arts… but his actions imply he actively avoids resorting to that).

### Obsidian Butterfly: C+

The ability associated with Itzpapalotl, the Aztec god of darkness.
It steals the target’s power, making them remarkably weak.
This Skill is also merged with Breaking Seclusion, the Counter Skill against curses and magecraft that a normal Heroic Spirit Ashiya Douman would have, allowing to negate arcane buffs and divine protections.
