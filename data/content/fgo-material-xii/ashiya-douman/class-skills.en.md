### Hedonist: EX

Douman’s philosophies and mindset are akin to that of a beast loudly laughing at the state of human society, gleefully trampling on the mundane niceties of every person’s lives, mocking love, manipulating emotion, and preying life and sanctity. This Skill is this mindset turned into a protean blade. Has Douman’s way of finding pleasure even in agony transcended all human limitations?
