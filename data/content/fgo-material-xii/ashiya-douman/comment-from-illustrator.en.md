I started expanding ideas from the “Japanese pierrot” keyword Takeuchi gave me and got the design done in one go. He struck me as a very complex figure, combining the mastery of latest field of knowledge of the Heian era (onmyoudou) with his primeval violence, resulting in a wild beast that learned enough about how humans live to be able to mock their pride. Mixing this impression with the “beast in human shape” line from the profile, the first thing that popped into my head was a sphinx, so the patchwork I was aiming for was civilized human beauty from the neck up and beastly human beauty from the neck down. He doesn’t wear half of the kimono so his fashion can accentuate his duality and the contrast between his face and body, and to leave the impression that his physical attacks are also strong. As he is one of the villains, I aimed to make his figure iconic when he confronted the protagonist and cathartic when he is defeated. (Furumi Showichi)
