### Kyourandodou · Akuryou Safu (Mad Maelstrom · Demonic Minister of the Left)

A reproduction of the astounding Greater Curse set up in an attempt to curse the authority of the time, Fujiwara no Michinaga, to death, which was akin to killing the city itself. If successful, the city would have instantly fallen into ruin, and the people would be assaulted by misfortune until the last of them starved to death. Naturally, the people in power also fall to ruin.

When the hex is used as a Noble Phantasm, the Demonic Minister of the Left (the grudgeful spirit of Minister of the Left Fujiwara no Akimitsu) fused with Douman’s Alter Ego version is temporarily summoned. This dramatically increases the spell’s chances of success.

The dark sun covering the sky at the end is an embodiment of Douman’s pride and maliciousness, and also a virtual composite manifestation of the components implemented in their Alter Ego form, the god of darkness Itzpapalotl, and the black god Chernobog.
