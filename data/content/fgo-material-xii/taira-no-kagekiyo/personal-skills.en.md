### Perish, O Genji: A++

Taira no Kagekiyo. Kills. The Genji.

### Kagekiyo Is Imperishable: EX

Taira no Kagekiyo never dies. Ceaselessly emerging, they will continue their advance in their thirty-seven attempts and beyond.
They’re portrayed in the Kabuki play “Kamihage” as an immortal being.
Of EX rank, this skill grants Kagekiyo Guts along with Instant-Kill resistance.

### Mist of Azamaru: B

They shroud themselves in fog to bewilder the enemy’s blade.
A sorcery that raises mist through Kagekiyo’s sword, the Azamaru (currently housed at the Atsuta Shrine).

### Outlaw: B

Taira no Kagekiyo cannot be captured.
Even if they become a prisoner, they shall certainly escape.
(fundamentally unused in Fate/GO).
