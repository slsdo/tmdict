### Personality

The one who kills Genji.
The Genji Slaying Device.
With a mentality that could be called that of a vengeful spirit on itself, they’re no different from a self-powered machine. They don’t show any signs of feeling things like joy or sadness; but had they really cast off such emotions, or are they merely closed to them? Who knows…

When in their Third Stage, they display symptoms of having returned a part of their ego as Minamoto no Yoshitsune. They also behave as if they were Yoshitsune herself when near their former-self or her related.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

They bear but a single wish for the Holy Grail, that is to say: Perish, O Genji.

### Dialogue Examples

“──Perish, O Genji.”
“Grudge. All but this sole word.”
“The Genji must be eradicated. There are too many of them in this world.”
“Understood. Akushichibyoe Kagekiyo shall lay waste to everything.”
“Slaughter shall be offered.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A mysterious character featured in the Tale of Heike. While of unclear background, this individual became widely known to the Genji and Heike forces as Akushichibyoe Kagekiyo of Kazusa. Although the Tale of Heike dub him as “The One from Kazusa” his specific origins have divergent answers among literature.

Eventually Akushichibyoe Kagekiyo would be hailed as Taira no Kagekiyo, the Avenger of the Heike…known worldwide as a vengeful spirit that constantly plots revenge against the Genji.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Somehow, the military exploits achieved by the Heike warriors and the hatred of those who fell for the Genji were all personified in the figure of Taira no Kagekiyo.
Kagekiyo made a total of twenty-seven attempts on Yorimoto’s life, but he survived each one of them.
Those who fosters vendetta for the Genji, whoever they may be, will eventually be Taira no Kagekiyo to bare their fangs against them.
Be they Kagekiyo or not, it matters little.
Be they Heike or not, it matters little.
It no longer matters who they are.
Those who grudge the Genji shall be subsumed into Taira no Kagekiyo.

The historical Kagekiyo may have actually escaped to the Chugoku region and lived out his last days peacefully there, but this is completely unrelated to the fact that the thing known as Taira no Kagekiyo will continue to harbor hatred towards the Genji for eternity.

Legends related to Kagekiyo are many, and historical landmarks (claimed to be) connected to him exist nationwide. In this summoning, though, Kagekiyo has become one with Minamoto no Yoshitsune. What does that mean? Basically: “the warrior who goes by Minamoto no Yoshitsune is but Taira no Kageikyo itself.”

Had Yoshitsune been incorporated into Kagekiyo because she harbored a grudge against Genji, or was it her deep grudge that acted as the core for Kagekiyo as an Avenger?
Yoshitsune was also Taira no Kiyomori’s son-in-law for a short period of time. So it could be said that such fact highlights that her path to attach into the Heike’s vengeful spirit had already been laid out during such early period of her lifetime.

### In Naraka Mandala Heian-kyō
