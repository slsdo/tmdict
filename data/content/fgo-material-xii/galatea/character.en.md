### Personality

Although there is the impression of otherworldliness one gets from her flawless outward appearance, Galatea is fundamentally gentle and lissome. A beautiful woman, or perhaps a beautiful girl, who is regarded as cool and graceful. There is rarely any need for her to raise her voice. But because she originated from the matter where she was born out of an inorganic substance, the impressions she gives out regarding her eccentricity and her ignorance about the ways of the world happen to come across as cool.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Galatea does not particularly have a wish she wants to make on the Holy Grail. However, she always thinks about “wanting to reunite with King Pygmalion with true love (generally by carving a statue of him while putting her love into it.)” Given that it is not like it is something that could be fulfilled by making use of the Holy Grail, she would probably refuse the Holy Grail even in the case where it was offered to her.

Regarding her Master, Galatea believes that if they could summon her, then that means they have an appreciation for (love towards) inorganic substances, which means they are a follower of King Pygmalion. She will serve as a helper for her Master with all her energy so that they can discover true love, saying “Regarding you, Master, you have the talent. I, Galatea, shall help you to the best of my meagre ability.”

### Dialogue Examples

“My name is Galatea… Yes, I understand. You could summon me, so that means you must be someone who has the same love as King Pygmalion. Until the moment we each obtain true love, I shall weird this chisel wholeheartedly————”
“In your country, there is a concept called ‘tsukumogami’, is there not? It was believed for a long time that souls – that personas – dwell within utensils that were continually being used… I think they are extremely good stories. Is there something like a story where something gets a human form and marries a gentleman?”
“Aphrodite Unit, activated————”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A character in the story about King Pygmalion, one of the Greek myths.

Pygmalion, who was both the King of Cyprus and a sculptor, was disillusioned about real women and had persisted with being unmarried, but on one occasion, he sculpted “The Ideal Woman” in white ivory. It came to be that he was madly in love with that carved statue that he personally created, and he presented it with clothes and gems. He talked to it, hugged it and kissed it like it was his lover. He wished from the bottom of his heart that the carved statue would become a living woman. The Goddess Aphrodite, who had been watching that, or perhaps his prayer was delivered to her, accepted Pygmalion’s wish and gave life to that carved statue. It is said that the carved statue that became a human being also became Pygmalion’s wife, and later on, she even had a child with him.

It is said that the island of Cyprus is the location where Aphrodite first arrived at after she was born, and it was originally a place of worship that was deeply related to Aphrodite.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

It is unmistakable that Galatea was born because of King Pygmalion’s love for dolls. There is no distinction between that love – which was so intense, it was to the extent that a deity happened to grant that wish spontaneously – and insanity. It was a natural situation where even Galatea, who was born because of King Pygmalion’s excessively strong love (insanity), and who spent her entire life together with him, would reach the point where she has that love (insanity).

Therefore, Galatea is summoned as a Berserker when she is summoned as a Servant.

Galatea is cherishing the circumstances of how she was born from King Pygmalion’s wholehearted love (insanity), and now that she became a Servant, she has a desire of “I want to demonstrate that true love too” even while she is assisting her Master in their battles. If there is true love within herself, then she should be able to conversely carve a statue of King Pygmalion and reunite with him.

Of course, Galatea believes it would be nice if that true love is not just within herself, but also within other people.

A doll-like beauty that cannot be attained with human intellect, a cool appearance, and a courteous manner of talking————
At a first glance, Galatea seems like a woman who is assumed to be detached, but there is a gap between that assumption and those words and deeds of hers alone that shows she has an eccentricity as a representative of the love for the inorganic.

It was Aphrodite who gave life to the carved statue named Galatea and turned it into a human being. But from where did that “life” that she gave at that time come from?

… Frankly, it was “Aphrodite herself” who is the foundation of that life. Of course, it was not the deity’s entire body, but only a part of it that was isolated and then detached so that it can be used as nothing more than the component materials for its core. Even so, a deity is a deity. If someone who possesses eyes that are on the level of a deity’s examines Galatea properly, they will completely grasp that the foundation of the existence named Galatea is none other than Aphrodite.

The powers Galatea uses in combat and the like originate from Aphrodite’s divinity too, and because she herself is not aware that she is a part of Aphrodite’s lineage, she recognizes instead that “Aphrodite is kindly bestowing me her divine protection even now.” Regarding Aphrodite, Galatea considers her to be a deity who she has a great debt of gratitude for, and a magnificent Goddess of Love who bestows Galatea her divine protection even now.

It is not exactly clear why Aphrodite, who lives according to an uninhibited love, did such a thing, but… it is said that Aphrodite possesses two sides: one side is the aggressive “Pandemos“ who presides over death and the like, and the other is “Urania” who presides over pure love; one can surmise that it is the latter side who probably had something to think about regarding King Pygmalion’s “love”.

### General Armaments

Sculpting tools such as a chisel.

### Connections with Characters

#### Blackbeard

Galatea believes that Blackbeard is the man who has the most sense in Chaldea. Because he loves the ideal two-dimensional characters and figurines of beautiful girls.

“WOOHOO! W-Will a bride really come out into the real world eventually!? I was not mistaken about the path I advance onnn!”

Ever since he became aware of Galatea’s existence, Blackbeard recently became even more disgusting, or something like that.

#### Medea

Galatea takes off her hat to Medea, a considerably skilled doll maker. Galatea hopes for Medea that, if she can reach the point where she can “love” while putting even more delusion into it, rather than “love” from a place that she took a step back to, then eventually…

#### Robots such as Fran / Danzou Katou / Nezha / Mecha Eli-chan / Mecha Eli-chan MkII…

Galatea is delighted that she feels a sense of fellowship with them.

“I wonder what sort of wonderful love everyone received that resulted in their births? If there is an opportunity, I certainly want to assemble everyone and talk together regarding each of our love. Right… A girls’ talk, yes?”

#### Artemis

“Hm? Hmm? Hmmm~? Hey, you, wait, wait for a moment. You… Are you Aphrodite by some chance? The fact is that you smell like her somehow!”

Galatea merely tilts her head to the side in confusion while looking at Artemis blankly, saying “But I simply have her divine protection.”

#### Artist Servants such as Hokusai / Gogh

Galatea likes them. She supports them from behind the scenes.

#### Caesar

When Galatea looks at Caesar, her mood becomes pleasant, as if she is looking at a son of hers for some reason. That is because Caesar had called himself a descendent of Venus (Aphrodite).

#### Nero

The Emperor who also has an appreciation for the fine arts. Galatea’s mood becomes pleasant when she looks at Nero, as if she is looking at an energetic daughter of hers somehow. (That is because Aphrodite favours Nero. Ex. Saber Venus.)

But from Nero’s point of view, it seems that Galatea likes the Muses – the Goddesses of the Fine Arts – more than Aphrodite.

#### Senji Muramasa

Galatea considers Muramasa’s carving ability to be top-class, but it somewhat appears that the thing he is aiming for in his works is not love…
