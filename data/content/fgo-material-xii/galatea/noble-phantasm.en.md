The materialization of the chisel that was wielded by King Pygmalion – the matchless sculptor – with divine skill. As an existence that was born out of that chisel, and in addition, as the person who was his wife, the Servant Galatea possesses this as a Noble Phantasm.

To begin with, what Pygmalion carved out of ivory was a maiden with a workmanship so exquisite, it is like the statue is living. The chisel wielded with divine skill produced a statue with a workmanship that was beyond human understanding, as though the statue even has life in the eyes of whoever sees it, as though even the person who was responsible for carving the statue completely fell in love with it, and as though a deity even thought it would be nice if they gave the statue life. Aphrodite’s Blessing is being loaded into this Noble Phantasm, and the things carved by this will have life and begin to move, as if the Legend of Pygmalion is being reenacted.

A small sculpted bird will spread and flap their wings in the sky, a sculpted snake will extend their tongue and slither around, and a sculpted rose will bloom among the briars. They are “things that are both sculptures and lifeforms” (in colour and texture) similarly like Galatea. But they cannot stay alive for eternity, and they will completely return to being ordinary exquisite sculptures when Galatea’s Magical Energy runs out. Moreover, even if a statue of a “human being” is carved, it will not be brought forth as a lifeform no matter how exquisitely made it is.

Regarding this, Galatea herself thinks, “I think it is because there is not enough love from me towards the object”, but on the contrary, it turns out that her respect for Pygmalion has increased, saying “Just as I thought, King Pygmalion is amazing.”

“If I compare my half-baked self to the King, then I still have a long way to go. I must study even more.”
One of the reasons behind Galatea’s conduct of “supporting others in the matter of acquiring true love (loving inorganic substances so that they turn into humans just like she herself had) from behind the scenes” is that she wants to improve herself even more by actually observing and studying that love up close.

————”I was born because I “received” that love, but it would be nice if I ended up in a position where I can “give” that love this time.”
————”Because then, someday, I might be able to carve a statue of King Pygmalion and reunite with him.”
