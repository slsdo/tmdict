### Madness Enhancement: EX

Pygmalion, the King of Cyprus who carved Galatea out of ivory as his ideal woman, had possessed “a love that was equal to insanity, of which it was so full of devotion, it completely made a carved statue into a human being”, and that was transmitted to Galatea, who became his wife. Coming to a mutual understanding with her is completely feasible, but she believes that “It is nice to love inorganic substances”, or rather, she is deadly serious in believing in things such as “Having love towards inorganic substances is precious”, “That surely gives rise to true love”, and “Everybody should love inorganic substances even more.” But it is not the case where she loudly talks about those things widely and on a routine basis. Before anything else, she herself accordingly decides on showing that true love of hers by first carving a statue of King Pygmalion in order to reunite with him.

If there is someone admiring a figurine, Galatea will fixedly look at them from afar while nodding her head in assent to a degree, openly showing that she is satisfied with what she is seeing, and even saying “Uh huh, yep.”

### Magical Resistance: B

A Skill that nullifies Magecraft spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. It is difficult to damage Galatea who has this Rank of Magical Resistance with Magecraft, even if she was targeted by Great Magecrafts, Ritual Spells and the like.

This is an effect of the divine protection bestowed by the Goddess Aphrodite, who is the foundation of the existence named Galatea.
