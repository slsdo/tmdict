Because the character setting wasâ€¦ white clothes, hair AND skin, I thought that it was hard to add accent colours in order for Galatea to not be displayed indistinctly for the illustrations of her. Since it is the case that she is a statue that was carved and created out of ivory, I designed her with the intention that in her initial state, her lower body is at the stage where it is a clump of ivory in a column shape that has not yet been carved out. In a rejected draft, everything other than her head had been covered in a suit, to the point that she was something like a sumo wrestler. (Shimada Fumikane)
