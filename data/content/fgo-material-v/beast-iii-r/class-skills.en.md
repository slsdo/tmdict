### Authority of the Beast: A

A skill that can surely be called Anti-Humanity.
Possesses a great understanding of lifeforms who discovered the meaning of reproductive acts, or more broadly speaking, the “continuation of the species”.
Enables the understanding of their purpose and the meaning in it, regardless of the difference in the form of knowledge.
…You could call it a special attack against religion and ideology.

### Independent Manifestation: B

If there is a voice pleading for salvation somewhere in the world, she can appear there.
Naturally, the method with which she saves the owner of the voice depends on the Beast.

### Logos Eater: A

The special trait of the Pleasure Deva. Provides a damage buff against any sentient being possessing intelligence (pleasure), regardless of scale or structure.
It is a powerful skill by itself, but when combined with the Authority of the Beast, it displays a truly horrible effect.

### Nega Saver: A

The fate of the beast who tried to bring salvation only to her own world, while possessing the qualifications to be a messiah (Saver).
Every skill possessed by the Saver and Ruler class is nullified, targets with magic stat not exceeding A rank are charmed with a 300% probability and the effect of buffs cast by Kiara are increased by 200%.
Although the scale of the existence of the Pleasure Deva that was born once on the moon is superior to Beast III, they say that she had no choice but to withdraw when faced with a messiah since she did not possess this skill.
