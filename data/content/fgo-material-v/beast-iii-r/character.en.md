### Dialogue Examples

「To think I would become SE.RA.PH itself──────
…Honestly, what an ordeal this turned out to be.
Inside the time that stretches ever longer, I have been attacked, destroyed and forsaken by Heroic Spirits on multiple occasions──────Truly, what a dream-like period it was.
You cannot purchase such religious exultation, no matter what you offer as compensation, no?」
「Everything was like foreplay for this.
At this rate, SE.RA.PH will reach the inner core of the Earth and I’ll become one with the planet──────
No. This planet will be inside me.
And with that said, it is time for the salvation of mankind.
Relieved from all sorts of suffering and pain,
seven billion beings will be used for the sake of just one’s salvation.」
「Color for the eyes. Words for the ears. Nectar for the mouth. Aroma for the nose.
And an exciting heat for the skin. Fufu, ufufufu, ufufufufu─────!
Your destination is the institution where life is destroyed, the maw of the Heavenly Paradise.
They say even a worm will turn… However, no one can escape from me now──────」
「The time of salvation has come.
Let’s call forth the pain and agony of every living creature.
I, alone, am human in this world, I, alone, am a star in this world.
Now’s the time to become the foundation of Paradise.
──────Sukhavati・Heaven’s Hole」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The “Hole of Heaven” is a variant of the True Magic known as Third Magic.
Although it draws substances into itself with ultra gravity like a black hole, its true nature is considered to be a disposal chute.
“Something inconvenient to possess when humans do good deeds”.
The beast crowned with the title of the “Hole of Heaven” is the malignant data of selfish humans──────
She accepts “All the World’s Desires” and continues to spread it.
Although it is undeniably repulsive and stagnant, this hole is a mechanism that is indispensable for society, expanding in scale at the same rate as intelligent activity is carried out.
For human beings, it’s something that shouldn’t exist, as it amasses their repulsive desires.

Love is a fine thing, and desire is also something good.
Be that as it may, it is the act of a beast when “love is turned into pleasure”.
Originally, love and desire are things to be thought of separately and they should be carried out at the same time for satisfactory results.
When the soul of the messiah who tried to love and bring joy to people attained the Third Magic, Sesshouin Kiara metamorphosed into something inhuman.
Wishing for the greatest salvation, she brings relief to every animal on Earth via pleasure while also becoming an outlet for said pleasure.
Seven billion lives for the sake of her own salvation alone, in an attempt to reach climax.
Unaffected by a purpose or a sufficient end, she’s just trying to bring salvation to a “human” with pleasure alone.

The Evils of Man revealed up to the appearance of Beast III were:
『Regression』: The desire to start over, the heart wishing to return to the beginning. Reset Desire.
『Pity』: A man’s feelings of pity for another, the compassionate heart. Self-serving Philanthropy.
『Comparison』: The heart that compares itself to another. Measurement without result. Vanity.
And then, the aspect that separated from the 『Pleasure』 of Beast III was 『Lust』.
Love is a good thing. Desire is a good thing too. However, one must not “turn love into pleasure”.
By their nature, love and desire are things that one must consider as separates.
When these become one, apoptosis will occur.
