Awright, Ms. Kiara~ let’s make your final ascension amazing! And so -「a cross-section view of a woman pregnant with the Earth」 or 「a naked portable shrine in space」 or 「an ordinary wide leg-spread」- three amazingly rough concepts, where nothing is shown and nothing is worn, were assembled, but they were really, really, really, completely out of the question. I learned a lot from this. Ain’t that right!!!! I drew her standing pose in the image of Buddhist pictures. Can I make the background a little more Mandala-like? Or would that be too much trouble??
