### Karma Phage: EX

KP. Kiara’s five senses…her erogenous zones…removed and bestowed upon others as skills when she turned her body into SE.RA.PH.
It appears to be an imitation of the way BB removed her love towards humanity - after finding it an unneeded extra - to create the Alter Egos.
Abbreviated as KP, they were named as Body, Sight, Mouth, Spice, and Organ, respectively.
Since the Sentinels bestowed with these can use Kiara’s Authority, they become immensely powerful Servants.

- Body: Suzuka. Only receives 10% of the damage dealt. However, poison alone is an exception.
- Sight: Eliza. Permanent sure-hit. Critical hit chance is greatly increased.
- Mouth: Lip. Half of the damage received is healed back as HP…is what its effect should’ve been, but due to Lip’s reluctance, it was limited to the effects of HP regen and Guts.
- Spice: Cat. One hit evasion, each turn. +Protection against critical hits.
- Organ: Melt. Increased resistance against stuns and every other action impending debuffs. As her HP decreases, she deals more damage and her defensive power increases.
 
### Myriad Colored Stagnation: EX

The thing that metamorphosed Sesshouin Kiara into a demonic boddhisatva.
A heretic technique once created by Kiara in a certain cyber world.
It was a medical software that separated the target’s body, mind and soul, stripping the soul naked (without the protection of the body or the mind) so it could listen to their woes and remove their anguish.
Of course, that was just a front.
These defenseless souls, detached from the body and mind, were absorbed into Kiara’s own soul, making sure to savour them carefully, while claiming this was salvation.
The power of the ultimate form “charm”, or “enthrallment”.
This power has only become stronger with her transformation into a Beast.
The beauty of Kiara who’s become a Tenma (the Demonic Boddhisatva) with Mara (the crown of the beast) on her head, shakes the sanity, reason, and morals of those who see her.
Those seen by Kiara, or those who saw Kiara, have to roll a check to see if they can sustain their sense of self.
Instead of a “Sanity point save”, it’s a “Kiara point save”.
The senses of sight, taste, hearing, smell and touch. These all have their saving rolls and if you find Kiara beautiful even just a little, you immediately fail.
Those who fail end up losing sight of their self and, after being assaulted by a little dizziness, they become Kiara’s devotees, standing on the palm of this boddhisatva without even realizing.

When you open your eyes, a flesh-colored plain stretches into infinity before you.
You’re standing on the boddhisatva’s palm.
In the direction of the eternally distant horizon, there’s Kiara smiling.
“Mankind is a collection of immature beasts.
Subsisting on their desires, drowning in their desires and dissolving into bubbles in their desires; such is their reality──────"
If it’s a goddess who would accept such animalistic nature as if she were a boddhisatva, is there anyone who could somehow refuse such enormous and immeasurable love?
With a single finger, she can grant you the overwhelming joy of enlightenment or reaching Nirvana.
The destination is the institution where life is destroyed, the maw of the Heavenly Paradise.
…Like this, no matter how much power one has, it becomes meaningless before a Tenma.
It is difficult for those who possess reason, those who know pleasure and those who know pain to escape from this salvation.
Of course, there is nothing about this salvation that would provide one relief.
Being granted the boddhisatva’s benevolence is the impression it gives, but that’s strictly from the victims’ point of view.
To Kiara, the believers on the palm of her hand are nothing but insignificant rabble on the same level as insects.

The fight with the Boss ver. Kiara starts -> whole party gets charmed by Myriad Colored Stagnation -> the battle stage changes to the stage of being on the palm of Kiara’s hand -> Game Over where you couldn’t do anything.
…such an ending developed in the FGO/CCC collab.
After that, we escape from Myriad Colored Stagnation with the help of BB, successfully seal the Demonic Boddhisatva transformation by making optimal use of the KP (Kiara Punisher) we collected and commencing the confrontation with Beast III.
