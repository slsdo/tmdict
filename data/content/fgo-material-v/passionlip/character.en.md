If it’s the female main character, when she wants to get along with her as a fellow girl and musters courage: 〇〇ちゃん (attach -chan to name).

### Personality

An intense personality regularly misinterpreted as introverted.
If something goes wrong, she has the habit of blaming others (surroundings) and withdrawing in her shell.
In 『CCC』that disposition…… Regularly, she can’t approach the opponent…… But although she showed herself as a stalker, after recognizing her own mistakes/faults, she refrained her disposition as a stalker, and started to aim to “work properly, get along properly”.
But her laziness (if there’s a reason she’ll skip work) hasn’t changed, she herself is aware of that bad part, and tries to fix that.
As a result, the current Passionlip positively tries to fix “my bad parts” every day, and has become a hard-worker girl.

In contrast with Meltlilith who was 『a girl that loves love』, Passionlip was 『a girl that seeks love』.
But since she won’t be loved for her outer appearance, since nothing will be obtained from that love even while seeking it, that love turned into hatred.
The Alter Ego of love and hatred, that’s what Passionlip was born as, but there isn’t even the shade of it in the current Lip.
Since she originally had an honest personality, her personality has become a bit like the one of the girl that 『became the base for BB』.

### Attitude towards Master

She is self-conscious about what a Servant with an atrocious and troubling ability she is.
For that reason, she is thankful to the Master who doesn’t abandon her and accompanies her.
That thankfulness will gradually change into deep affection and longing, and in the end she’ll dream of love.
…… However, Lip, who is self-conscious of her biography and specialty, can’t 『seek love innocently』.
If she’s infatuated, if she can be loved, she’ll hurt that gentle person.
That’s why while she keeps dreaming like this, she strives to become the Master’s power from the shadows.

### Dialogue Examples

「……I’m, the Alter Ego of love and hate, Passionlip……
Er…… If I hurt you, I’m sorry……」
「It’s a luxurious plate, but my hands are a bit…… Eh? You’ll feed me? T-then, please.
…… Fufu. It’s been more painful to be able to see my own figure properly, but there are also more happy things……」
「Since there are lots of fun things in this world, it’s hard not to lose to temptation. But that’s what living means. Good night, Master-san. Thank you very much for having summoned me.」
「…… Ah. I was mailing Melt right now……
How cruel…… Today was my date……. To people who do such things, I’ll make them a cube and throw them to the bottom of the deep valley, you know……?」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A familiar created by BB by separating her own personality (feelings).
Because she’s not a 『copy of the personality』 but 『something made based on the personality』, she didn’t become an avatar but an alter ego (another personality).
The Alter Ego of love and hate.
An impressive girl with a chest too big and ferocious claws. She doesn’t like fighting, but since her skill Masochistic Constitution makes her be attacked by her surroundings, she reluctantly counter-attacks.
The best power character from among the Alter Egos.
A monopolizing, blind incarnation of sought love that embraces her opponent, twists them off, and keeps them in her chest……
That’s what she was, but after being corrected in a certain encounter that unilateral sought love isn’t good, she’s careful not to harm the surroundings with the numerous lethal weapons of her body, and has become a shy yet gentle AI.

The bodies of three goddesses have been incorporated in Passionlip.
The first goddess is the goddess of beauty in India, Parvati.
The goddess that loved the god of destruction Shiva blindly and dedicatedly.
The second goddess is the goddess of war, Durga.
The aspect of Parvati, Durga, possesses ten divine weapons.
Passionlip’s huge claws embody those ten swords.
The third goddess is the Nordic goddess of war, Brynhildr.
A queen that, unable to be united with the hero she fell in love with, brought ruin out of sorrow. Regarded as Brünnhilde in Wagner’s opera, and synonymously in the description of some old Edda, she appears as a warrior maiden that sends the souls of the dead to heaven. Not to mention, the circumstances here turned love into despair too, a tragedy in which a loved one was killed with those hands.

### Perceptive Disorder

Many people can’t look at themselves objectively.
It can happen not only mentally, but physically.
Humans can’t look at themselves.
No, to be correct, the impartiality to look directly at “my appearance without falsehoods” is scarce.
Since humans have wisdom, only convenient information from the reality in front of their eyes becomes truth.
It’s not like selection of information, but a hoax of information, that sometimes happens unconsciously to the point of modification.
Passionlip’s perceptive disorder was the most extreme.
She can’t recognize the shape of her own two hands. Her “brain” made her eyes to avert her hideous form, an exaggerated inter-cerebral conversion of her arms as those of a normal girl.
She only saw her claws as 『something normal』.
For this reason, Lip couldn’t understand the reason of “why are they scared of me?”.
Not understanding that her body is ugly as a reason, when she was pointed out that she only tilted her head:
『Why do you say such a lie?』
『Do you want to bully me to the point of lying?』
Yes, she could only hate her surroundings.
However, her current self is confronting her body properly and accepting her monstrosity.
Regarding her huge nails and perceptive disorder, Passionlip is a complete victim.
Because even though her perceptive disorder was born from escape, there are no deceptions or lies in her heart.

### Connections with Characters

#### BB

Selfish, conceited, sly, scary, mean, she was a person I couldn’t see but…… I’ve lost just a bit of that dislike recently. But since facing being a mother (original) is troubling, if there were reasons and chances…… N-no, it’s nothing!

#### Meltlilith

The closest one to BB from among the Alter Egos, an Alter Ego that isn’t recommended to others.
Although she’s a mass of desire to control (pride) that gets excited when hurting her surroundings, I seriously think she’s more elegant than BB.
Also, the part of swaggering about 『I’m the older sister』 despite her manufacturing date being the same as mine is very childish, right?

#### Sesshōin Kiara

I don’t understand it really well, but I feel she’s similar to Melt.
Melt is much prettier, though.

#### Gawain

He’s a very reliable knight! A prince with a white horse…… He’s a bit different than that, a prince that grows like that, has rather become an adult that knows his position as a feudal lord…… Anyways, although I don’t like him I think he’s a wonderful person!

#### Tamamo Cat

My first friend.
It seems she’s an Alter Ego different from the Sakura Five.
Being together is fun, calms me down, and makes me happy.
She’s also very good at cooking! Cat, incredible!

#### Robin Hood

Physiologically not good.
