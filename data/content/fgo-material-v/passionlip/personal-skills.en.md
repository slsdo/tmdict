### Breast Valley: A

Function for temporarily storing and archiving unnecessary data files. Same as a trash can.
In Passionlip’s case, that icon is set for some reason at the center of her chest.
To put it briefly, it’s a pocket of imaginary numbers where you can accumulate all the trash you want.
If it’s dust data crushed by Passionlip, they can be infinitely stored no matter the capacity. It seems that even those exceeding Lip’s own memory can be dumped into this valley.
Although it looks like a convenient function at first glance, since the dust data won’t return to their original form, it’s a completely meaningless function.
Passionlip is thought to have gained this particular structure because she’s a self-destructive/self-harming type of girl that keeps her feelings inside.
In 『CCC』, once something fell in this valley of death it wouldn’t crawl up again, but in 『FGO』she became able to scoop up the contracted Master.

### Masochistic Constitution: A

Passionlip’s id_es skill.
In a collective battle, gathers the hostility (hate) of the enemy towards oneself, and increases the probability of being targeted by attacks.
Although it may be seen as a disadvantage, this skill makes those with a strong defensive power that have it function as excellent escort guards.
Besides including a slight bonus to defense, an additional special effect comes at A rank, the attackers lose their calm as they attack, and in the end they will only be able to think about the one with this skill. A skill that leads to death in one-versus-one, but a very useful skill in battles with a party.

### Trash & Crash: EX

Called an id_es skill, one of the particular skills possessed by the Alter Ego · Sakura Series derived from BB.
A cheat skill evolved from 『Monstrous Strength』.
No matter how huge the capacity may be, as long as it is “something that can be wrapped with the hands”, it’ll be crushed and compressed by those claws.
Although what has been compressed becomes a 1 cm square cube, its mass can only be reduced to one tenth of what it was before the compression. Compressed things are later treated as dust data.
What can be compressed are only things smaller than Lip’s hands―
No, “what fits in the hand” from her point of view is treated as a target.
It’s planar physical interference that ignores perspective, but as expected it takes time to compress large things. A cheat-like pictorial compression technique (codec) unique to a digital space.
Lip is specialized in destruction, and if the target is stationary…… terrain or a building, she displays destructive power superior to BB.
Although, if the opponent is a Servant or a Master, escaping from the quick-to-sense-danger Lip’s vision → the dull Lip not chasing them is the outcome.
