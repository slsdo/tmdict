### High Servant: A

An artificial Servant made by synthesizing the essence of multiple myths.
Contains elements from Parvati, Durga, and Brynhildr.

### Magic Resistance: C

Cancels spells with a chant below two verses.
Can’t defend against large scale magecraft like High-Thaumaturgy or Greater Rituals.

### Independent Action: C

Ability to act independently for a period even if mana supply from the Master is severed.
Alter Egos which exist as 『another aspect of a certain existence』can work independently without a Master, but since Lip is bad at economizing her fuel the rank has lowered.

### Presence Concealment: A+

A skill to act while hiding one’s form.
A skill that the Assassin class has as a basic ability.
Lip displays an excellent Presence Concealment from her cowardice and prudence, but her huge claws get in the way and make her be found out immediately.
Were it not because of her claws she’d be an outstanding stalker.
