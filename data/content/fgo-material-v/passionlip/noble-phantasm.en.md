Brynhildr Romantia.
An Anti-Mind Noble Phantasm given to Alter Ego by BB.
Since the Noble Phantasms of the Alter Egos are illegal reconstructions of regular Noble Phantasms, the Servant used as a material is the Walküre Brynhildr from the 『Volsunga Saga』.
A spear of hate and love wielded for revenge against her husband Sigurðr, who betrayed her and wounded her honor.
Passionlip’s Noble Phantasm’s property too…… The more intense the love towards the opponent, the more intensely powerful…… That’s what it had, but that’s a story of the past.
The heart that ounce shouted called 『Until Death does us apart』, now has changed to hope for 『Even if Death does us apart』.
Farewell will surely come. Whether that is a catastrophe or a treason, love itself can’t be denied.
『No matter the farewell, since the love until then was true, I’ll believe it’s eternal』
As Lip wished, it became power not to hate the loved one, but to protect the loved one. Truly pure innocence and mature saint girl power.
After dealing great damage to the enemy party, it restores the energy of the ally party.
