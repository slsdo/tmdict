Sneferu Iteru Nile.
To the disrespectful who toy with the throne of the Pharaoh who is a god, a punishment.
To the treacherous who killed the loved siblings, death.
The Pharaoh that was appointed as their puppet, Nitocris, could never forgive the influential figures that looked down on the gods.
She gathered them and opened a banquet at a secretly built subterranean chamber, and she drowned every single of them when a great amount of water from the Nile entered the chamber and filled it ――― that’s how it’s said that Nitocris accomplished her revenge.

This vengeance that was written in the work 『The Histories』of the Greek Herodotus, became the Noble Phantasm of Nitocris in the Assassin class.
That is, a revenge that leads to death by enclosing the enemy’s surroundings with stone walls and pouring the water of the Nile. High-Thaumaturgy falsely resembling a Reality Marble.
