Since I started with the design of the first Ascension, I thought that the first impact would be important. But there’s too much impact in the first Ascension, so the second and third ones won’t be seen so much… I had that sense of uneasiness and was really nervous until she was implemented, but I felt so relieved to support so many people with the second and third ones. By the way, the first time I submitted the illustration for the final Ascension she wasn’t wearing it, so I was scolded by the president when they supervised it and made her wear it. (Shimaudon)
