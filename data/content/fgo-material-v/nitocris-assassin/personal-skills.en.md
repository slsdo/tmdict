### White Imperial Garments: A

The white imperial garments (for some reason, read as mizo instead of gyoi) Nitocris wears.
It is said that these garments are proof of Medjed’s protection and affection.
Since it’s a personal statement, it’s unknown if it’s true.

### Beach Panic: EX

What’s that……?
What the……?
Whether it’s by the protection of Medjed or by whatever, Nitocris, who is wearing the white imperial garments, gathers strange looks from the public.

### Royal Road of Hot Sands: A

A skill derived from Imperial Privilege.
With this skill, Nitocris has obtained close combat skills she shouldn’t have any future at.
It’s possible that she came up with something after seeing Cleopatra’s Pharaoh Martial Arts.
