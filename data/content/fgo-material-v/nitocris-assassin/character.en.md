### Personality

Nitocris was ashamed of herself.
Deeply embarrassed for having served rudely to the Pharaoh Ozymandias, she covered herself with a gown with an『I can’t face him anymore!』. (Saint Graph First Stage)

However, she hides pride as a Pharaoh in her chest.
In the end, she’s just ashamed of facing other Pharaoh figures.

With her clothing change, her Saint Graph changed too, and even her Noble Phantasm has changed by entering the Assassin class…… But inside she’s the same Nitocris as usual.
As usual, she is quick to jump into the wrong conclusion, careless and of quick temper.

### Attitude towards Master

The attitude towards the Master doesn’t change.
In the end, a Master is an 『ally hand』 for her.
『That’s fine, but I’ve recently been feeling I’ve been treated like a pile of junk although Pharaohs are great』

### Dialogue Examples

『DISRESPECTFUL, DISRESPECTFUL, THAT’S DISRESPECTFUL……』
『DIVINE PUNISHMENT IS CERTAIN』
『Although I change my appearance, I’m me. I’m your ally.』
『As a matter of fact, I don’t hate swimming at the waterside. Yes, by the side of the Nile with my brothers, I often……』
『Eh? Pool? What are you talking about? When did I say I want to go to the pool?』

This summer, Nitocris, who heard the opening of the event thought 『It’s the perfect chance to show the Pharaoh’s majesty!』.
However, if you read carefully the participation conditions, a support role is needed. That’s a problem.
It may be irreverent, but by telling them the circumstances, she’d let the other Pharaohs be the drivers, and she’d just act as a support.
With that said, she searched about for the Pharaohs, but ―――
After being flatly rejected by the Pharaoh Ozymandias with an 『I’m not interested. Get lost』, Nitocris felt deeply ashamed.

With that, she couldn’t meet his face.
She was so embarrassed, she covered herself with a gown and hid her face.
That form is completely like Medjed’s……

Then, something happened.
Perhaps because she resembles Medjed, or perhaps for other causes, Nitocris’ Saint Graph changed temporarily. Her class also changed to Assassin. (Saint Graph First Stage)

Furthermore, she’s wearing a swimsuit under the gown. (Saint Graph Third Stage)

If she finishes the Ishtar Cup safely, she vaguely thought that she could make use of these mystic imperial garments to manufacture summer dresses or something like that. (Saint Graph Third Stage)
Thinking about it, she took the shape she thought of. This bizarre phenomenon would be handed down among the Chaldea staff as 『Medjed-sama’s Blessings』, or not……
