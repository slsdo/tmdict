### Narrator: EX

A Skill that shows how skillful one is in verbally reciting tales and legends. Entirely different from the art of writing down tales in books, it is a story conveyance ability specialized in improvisation, allowing one to also take into account the mood and mentality of the audience to choose an appropriate way of reciting a story. It is likely that Rakugo storytelling Heroic Spirits possess this too.

### Bedchamber of Survival: A+

A subclass of the “Pheromone” Skill, specialized for defense.

By combining “her own charm”, “the charm of the place” and “the charm of her actions” in the most suitable way according to the situation presented, she can form and make use of “an area where she has the lowest probability of death in the World.” Although it is a conceptual area, it is also another “sleeping quarter”, a safety base that is just like her Workshop as well.

### Counter-Hero: A

A Skill that brings down the parameters of any hero on the occasion of dealing with them.

This Skill for her is being limited to “anti-king”. For that reason, it acquires Rank A. In her case, it becomes something that especially demonstrates “the capability to survive against existences that have taken the title of king”, grasping the king’s mood, disposition, abilities, principles, state of health, etc., to make use of every art of coaxing she has so that by doing this, no matter how capricious a king can be, she can conduct herself in a way that will at least not get herself killed.

————In the moment when she has decided to confront a king as a storyteller with “a heroic tale that is about to be erased”, or in the moment when she has carried out a justifiable confrontation with a story of “a hero who secretly saved the world”, this is sublimated into a special Skill unique only to her, Counter-Hero (Story).
