Because “One Thousand and One Nights” was the concept, I drew her while constantly looking at the materials of that source. I was being conscious of a way to make her design not overlap with FGO’s existing characters, but also so that it does not drift too far away from FGO’s concept of its character designs. I got to choose the way her skin is coloured with my own tastes, making it a considerably dark brown colour. Though I think there are pros and cons to her design, including the shaping of her face too, usually I am getting to draw freely because of TYPE-MOON-san. I am grateful to them.

The final form of her weapon is my favourite, something like a 6-mounted launcher. Such an item is not limited to this work since it is common for me to habitually draw one-of-a-kind items, so it has structurally become quite complicated and bizarre. Even though I drew a 3-sided view of it, I was wracking my brains on if it was the way the design should be. Well, it must have been difficult for the people who created the data for the game’s use… I would like to tell them my thanks for letting me borrow their place. Although Miss Schehera is rather excessively strong-willed, if she gets to serve you as an attendant for a long time, she will be happy when she is able to accept you showing your deep affections to her even like a squid.
