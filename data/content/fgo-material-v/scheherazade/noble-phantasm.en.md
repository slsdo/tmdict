Alf Layla wa-Layla (One Thousand and One Nights). This is a Reality Marble of “her narrated tales”. By narrating them with such an overwhelming presence/sense of reality to the extent that even the World believes in it, those “tales” are made to be materialized. It summons and gives form to the characters, tools and spirits that appeared within One Thousand and One Nights. “Harun al-Rashid”, “Sinbad”, a “Magic Carpet”, “Aladdin”, a “Jinn (Spirit of the Lamp)”, “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves”, “Yamlika, the Queen of Serpents”, and so forth. Even episodes that did not exist in the original (historically proper) One Thousand and One Nights and were written/absorbed into it in posterity are able to be employed given that they will be helpful to her survival as a Heroic Spirit. What is important is not their validity. It is whether or not the king can be entertained by these tales. Naturally, if a large number/large variety of things are produced all at once, the more that are produced, the steeper the magical energy consumption becomes. As a matter of course, the conclusion of the tale (Noble Phantasm) is brought to a finish like thus:

“————and such, was the story.”

From its origin, this Noble Phantasm has an attack specialty against those with the King attribute. As long as they are an existence similar to a king, even if they are strictly not such a being, there are cases where they would be regarded as a “king” to her.

“Since it is told that she is the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven… it seems that she is a king then. I cannot read my words because she is terrifying…”
