Outrage Amazon.
The desire of vengeance against Achilles that sleeps within her; her soul as a warrior that seeks strength; the blood of the war god Ares; all of those are momentarily excited. She deliberately transform herself into a beast who had thrown away all reason, a true mad warrior.
Charging ahead while shouting “ACHILLEEEESSS!!”, (even if the enemy is not Achilles, at that moment they are for her) she attacks with every single weapon and body parts she has, and finally deals a finishing blow by biting them, just like a beast.
The ultimate anti-Achilles killing technique.

To digress a bit, a German playwright of the 18th century who went by the name of Heinrich von Kleist had created the play “Penthesilea” which derived itself from the legend of Penthesilea and Achilles. In it, Achilles had fallen in love and personally dropped his weapon (purposefully letting himself be apprehended), challenged Penthesilea on a one-on-one combat, but then was murdered by Penthesilea who had went mad for revenge. What the Amazons subordinates saw was the sight of Penthesilea, biting Achilles’ limbs off his corpse together with a hunting dog.

### Trojan Reinforce: Warriors to Rush Upon My War Cry{{n1}}

Trojan Reinforce.
It summons her 12 subordinates, the Amazons troops that she had once led in order to save Troy: Clonie, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, Antandre, Bremusa, Hippothoe, Harmothoe, Alcibie, Antibrote, Derimacheia, and Thermodosa{{n2}}. Each of them, while possessing noble lineage, had swore a loyalty oath to the queen from their heart; mighty elite Amazons, each equals a thousand soldiers.{{n3}} They have an outstandingly high affinity with Penthesilea’s Howl of the War God, able to acquire its effect several times more potent than other Amazons. To add, they are also able to perform a function as a relay.
This Noble Phantasm is linked to the “Penthesilea who participated in the Trojan War”. Berserker Penthesilea avoids “her own figure upon that moment”, and fundamentally unable to make use of this Noble Phantasm. If she manifest in a different Class, it is possible that she would be in possession of this Noble Phantasm.
In the case that she uses this Noble Phantasm while manifesting as a Berserker, in that instant, by means of paradox logic she would change her figure into “the completed Penthesilea, whose beauty akin to even that of a goddess”, yet-------simultaneously, she would be committing a lethal self-contradiction, and the inevitable fate of destruction would be engraved on her spirit core. (In FGO, it is fundamentally not being utilized.)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} It’s literally elite warriors, but its a bit too mouthful for my taste.
2. {{note2}} Bit of trivia: these name list came from Smyrnaeus, and other sources actually listed different names for the twelve that accompany Penth. Also, some of their name apparently has their own meaning, among them: Antandre “Preceding Men”, Bremusa “Raging Female”, Hippothoe “Imperious Mare”, Harmothoe “Sharp Nail”.
3. {{note3}} This is an idiom in Japanese, which can just translate to super duper mighty warriors. I keep it literal because I like how the prose sounds. Just something to keep in mind for badass versus.
