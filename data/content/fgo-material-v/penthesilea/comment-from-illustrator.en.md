When I met Takeuchi-san, he said to me to please draw a female Servant around 14 years old of age. And I was like with immense gratitude do I accept this request as you demand it. The muscular specification was really unexpected, but perhaps this too, is a part of karma. My Amazons (misprinted) CEO is the greatest. (Shinjirou)
