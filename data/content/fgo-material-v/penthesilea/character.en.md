### Personality

When she is not being engulfed but the anger and desire for revenge towards Achilles, she is a stoic and calm female warrior.
She is severely brutal against her enemies.
Even if one is an ally, she would rage upon them if they were to treat her as a women. Especially taboo are the words “beautiful” and “lovely” due to the trauma she has.
A battle frenzy whose identity is her strength as a warrior.
Due to being a queen, she is fundamentally arrogant.

### Attitude towards Master

Her wish upon the Holy Grail is, obviously, for a rematch against Achilles.
She wishes to dispel her old disgrace, and this time once again carry out an one-on-one battle as a true warrior.

She treats the Master as someone who shows her the way towards the battlefield and someone who prepares trials for her. Something like, “Now, promptly lead me towards the next battlefield.”

### Dialogue Examples

“Queen of the Amazoness, Penthesilea. I have come in response to your summon… But first. If Achilles is here, take him out. I will kill you if you keep it a secret.”
“Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles… Hm. Heroes. Heroes, huh. It is their fault that us Amazons’ country was thrown into turmoil. However, I do admit that they are all strong warriors.”
“Treat me not as a woman. I have had enough of such an experience.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Penthesilea is the queen of Amazon in the Greek mythology.
A daughter of Ares, it is said that she also has several sisters, starting with Hippolyte whose belt was stolen by Heracles.

After Hector’s death, the Amazons’ troops that Penthesilea led went to assist the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans. Afterwards, she went on to fight on a one-on-one combat against the hero on the opposing side, Achilles, yet---------

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She is filled with hatred towards Achilles.
Hatred so powerful, that she herself wishes to obtain the Mad Enhancement.

She had went on to fight on a one-on-one combat against Achilles as a warrior. When the match is concluded, the words that she heard Achilles had uttered upon removing her helmet-------
She was astonished.
How absurd, she thought in rage.

She had fought as a warrior. She had not present herself as a woman.
When a hero finishes their fight to the death with a true warrior, they should have looked at the enemy and be relieved. “I won.” “I’m glad I didn’t die.” “Just don’t get up.”
And yet---
This miscreant, this Achilles---
He dared to utter “beautiful”?
Towards her, the queen of Amazon, a warrior… that is the greatest of insult he can offer.
Because it meant that Achilles had really, truly not even seen her as a warrior.

She raged, raged, and raged; she went even beyond rage.
She could do nothing but sneer at him.
She could do no more than to curse him, amounting to no more than a harassment.

“Then curse you I shall. So that someday, that spear of yours would pierce the one you loved-----”

Whether or not that curse came true.
In what way does that curse hold meaning in his tale.
She cared not.

Inhale that curse.
Remember it each time you place your eye upon that spear, Achilles.
Remember the Amazon queen that you killed with your hand.
Remember of the disgrace you offer me.{{n1}}

My existence, the queen, and my last moment--------I shall not allow you to lump it in together with those other you have defeated. I shall never allow you to throw it away to the corner of your memory of battlefield.

That alone.
I shall never, ever allow.

<>

She swore so.
That defeat was, without a doubt, a disgrace carved upon the very core of her existence.
And so she will once again fight him with all of her might, and absolutely, absolutely end him.

And if her being a “beautiful woman” become a hindrance for it, then she must not let it be displayed.

And so Penthesilea, upon being summoned in Chaldea, manifest with the figure of a young woman whose “beauty” is yet to be completed.
And nevertheless, still she possesses her might as a warrior.
As a warrior, she wishes only for victory and strength, so much that she had fallen to madness. She fights--------as a true queen of Amazon.

She believes, that beyond this path, the rematch against the detestable Achilles await her.
