### Happy Comrades: A

Originates from the anecdote where a bunch of abnormal stalwarts gather under Bunyan.
It seems that it is not due to a coincidence that Bunyan’s comrades and the crops he raises up are enormous, but due to Bunyan’s Skill influence.

### Bean Soup Lake: A

Originates from the anecdote where Bunyan’s camp make bean soup out of the whole lake, enough food for a season.
Bunyan has the ability and the magnanimity to provide for tens of thousands of corps.
As long as you’re with Bunyan, you’d never miss a meal.

### Popcorn Blizzard: B

Originates from the anecdote where the animals, who misunderstood of the shell of popcorn that Bunyan ate and downpoured from the sky as blizzard, froze to death.
The death from the cold even though it’s not like snow was actually falling, was perhaps due to an unconscious mind attack, or perhaps through the warping of reality by means of Bunyan’s skill.
