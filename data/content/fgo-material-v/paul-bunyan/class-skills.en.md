### Mad Enhancement: D

Rank up parameters by 1, but takes away reasons for the most part.
In Bunyan’s case, instead of her reasons, it maddens her foundation existence instead; she is unable to recall whether she is spoken of as a man or woman in the legend.

### Saint Graph Expansion: D

A Skill falsely similar to “Shapeshift”.
A Skill that enlarges and strengthens her own Saint Graph while keeping her form the same. It includes not only scale up but also scale down.
Bunyan’s size changes depending on the environment.
Within a room with ceilings, she would settle on a size where her head would touch the ceiling as she stoop, but even during movement in which the environment is not constant, her size would change to a compliant size to the place unnoticed. Even if one were to intently looks, it would be like looking at trompe l’oeil, the situation changing before one notices.
Perhaps it is due to that’s how things are in the literature source, but it seems like observation of her size changes circumstances is impossible.
This is a digression, but she knows that through the folkloristic world she is treated as a fake lore, and she really minds a lot about it.
This Skill rank being low is also considered to be one of the reason she has no self-confidence if she isn’t worthy of being Heroic Spirit.
Carelessly touching the subject would make her show a troubled smile with a sad face.
Please don’t.
Also, she completely does not understand the reason of why she is summoned as a woman.
