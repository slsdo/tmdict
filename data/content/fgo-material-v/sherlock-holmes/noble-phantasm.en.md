The Noble Phantasm that Sherlock Holmes ended up possessing when he is materialized as a Heroic Spirit and Servant. It is his own Origin – “Elucidation” – sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.

Even if the enigma he faces is truly an existence that is impossible to explain, the clues and the path for its explanation will “appear” to Holmes’ advantage so that he can finally arrive at the truth of it without fail. For instance, even if there was a treasure chest where its key was lost, said key will turn out to be “not lost.” It reaches the point that the key can certainly be discovered in someplace in the world. (But as one would expect, it will not do things such as making the key suddenly appear in the middle of his hand. Wherever it may be located, Holmes and his collaborators must make efforts to find it.)

It is primarily a Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type, but Holmes can perform its True Name Release in “Fate/Grand Order”. At the moment of its True Name Release, an unidentified “sphere” makes its appearance, releasing a dazzling light on the surrounding areas. It weakens the enemy camp and strengthens the allied camp. Even if the opponent is supposed to be unbeatable, Holmes will always discover a path to victory and the truth for the sake of defeating them.

Holmes does not speak of what this “sphere” is. Is it an object that concretely expresses his Origin, or is it an object solidified as the memory of his once close friend? Or perhaps, is it no more than a distraction done for the purpose of concealing “What is Sherlock Holmes actually doing?”————

Moreover, this Noble Phantasm’s name is one of the famous phrases associated with Holmes, but its first instance as Holmes’ catchphrase was actually not in Doyle’s stories, but in the stage play starred/scripted/produced by William Gillette. It is said that Doyle praised the Holmes played by Gillette with the statement “He is better than the one in my stories.” Incidentally, Holmes has remarked the word “Elementary” towards Watson in Doyle’s short story “The Adventure of the Crooked Man”, and Gillette got the idea of the phrase from that.

A disguise Noble Phantasm. It even imitates the abilities of the disguised person themselves, but it is not a perfect imitation. If one were to take Holmes disguising himself as another Servant as an example, the values of the disguised Servant’s Parameters are unable to be higher than his own’s, and regarding their Skills and Noble Phantasms, they are unable to be copied.

(At the time of the Shinjuku Phantom Spirit Incident, Holmes mimicked the King of the Cavern’s combat style by simultaneously utilizing multiple Mystic Codes that he purchased from Kaburagi. After all, it is purely the King of the Cavern’s outward appearance that was copied, and regarding his copied power and nature, they do not exceed the limits of the Magecraft Mystic Codes that were being distributed in Shinjuku and used by Holmes. Even so, despite thoroughly using the Mystic Codes frenetically, Holmes was narrowly able to maintain the Ranked-Down Ether Body, hiding his identity.)
