The silhouette that follows and is associated with Detective Holmes remains undisturbed, and he was planned with the concept where the particulars about him are peculiar when they are examined skillfully. The 6 lenses he is equipped with are similar to the bees that are associated with the episode where he did beekeeping after his retirement as a detective. The colour I put in for his image was blue, which is falsely yet mysteriously similar to the image colour of his destined rival, Professor M (who was illustrated by RAITA-sensei), and I recall that at the moment of the Professorâ€™s implementation, I was unable to stand up due to being struck with admiration the most out of anyone in the world.
