### Personality

Contemplative, yet active. Bold, yet precise. And a calm, cool and collected man. Whatever the mystery, crime or scheme, they cannot escape from Holmes’ sight. Whether it is a dreadful murderer, a curse from the ancient times, a monster of the dark night, or even a secret society on a supranational scale, he shall disclose them all————and defeat them if necessary. With the sharp blade called Truth.

That way of being has already surpassed the Realm of Man and is even the personification of a “Wise Man” and a “Revealer”.

### Attitude towards Master

Holmes does not want the Holy Grail.

### Dialogue Examples

“Is an introduction necessary? I’m a detective. If it’s the case that you were desiring for a hero, then I can’t help but say that it’s unfortunate, but if it’s the case that you were desiring for a detective or a reasoner, then you drew an excellent card.”
“You’re watching, yes? However, you mustn’t merely observe with your eyes alone.”
“I see. Very interesting.”
“It looks like there’s a new case. Well then, let’s enjoy ourselves, shall we?”
“————Baritsu!”

### Character Image

The world’s greatest and sole consulting detective. The crystallization of the concept of a detective and the representative of the “Revealers”. The protagonist of the stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in the 19th~20th Century, Sherlock Holmes is a detective who explains every mystery, and he is considered to be————one of the progenitors of the “detectives” that appear in the many mystery novels of later years.

‘The figure of the Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes takes after Dr. Joseph Bell – who was conveyed to others as his model – Doyle himself, or the world’s oldest detective, Vidocq’————Holmes materializes not as any of the above, but as the protagonist of a series of stories and works (for that character’s words and deeds can only be regarded as those of a protagonist’s).

In the end, is the series of stories, starting with “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes”, really a complete fiction that Sir Doyle produced, is it maybe something written down by Dr. John H. Watson as a biographical story of the Holmes that existed in real life, or is it perhaps a cross between the two? Holmes himself should at least have an understanding of the truth, but there is never a time where he speaks of it from his own mouth, and he easily dodges the topic whenever it does come up in a conversation.

According to the records of the Clock Tower, it is an incontestable fact that a great detective called Holmes has existed in the past in London. There are furthermore records where he used the pseudonym Sigerson and proceeded towards the Tibetan Back Regions. In an unexplored region where Mystery still remains, he was also with a certain occultist and attended to her last moments.

“Supposing the case that he originated from the stories for argument’s sake, there’s a possibility that the stories comprise not only Doyle’s stories but even pastiches too…”, or so it was told by a Chaldea personnel, but one can probably say that this hypothesis clashes with the recorded facts.

Or maybe it can be thought of in this way: ‘Though is it also possible for a way of thinking where, as a result of receiving the influence of creative works, the Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes became the perfected form of the “great detective” that actually existed in the past————?’

### General Armaments

Hand-to-hand combat attacks by means of baritsu. Also, Holmes can produce beams of light with objects and the like that are remodelled into… his personal accessories, which are like special Magecraft Mystic Codes. Holmes declares that these are “a large number of Mystic Codes that were discovered in the Back Regions of Tibet during the Great Hiatus”, but the veracity of this statement is ambiguous.

### Connections with Characters

#### Leonardo da Vinci

His colleague at Chaldea. A fellow genius. From the way it seems, da Vinci is one of the few people who can carry out a conversation with Holmes and make him let his guard down.

#### Helena Blavatsky

An acquaintance from while he was alive. Holmes clearly remembers, even now, the facial expressions Helena showed and the words she told him during her last moments.

#### Jekyll

An acquaintance from while he was alive. From the way it seems, Holmes feels some responsibility for allowing Moriarty’s “Evil” to become the trigger for Hyde’s birth.

#### Jack the Ripper

The culprit of a series of grotesque murder cases that happened during his lifetime in which Holmes could not get involved for it was within “the domain of the Clock Tower”. Every time he sees her, Holmes happens to show a deeply emotive look on his face.

#### Charles Babbage

His client in regard to the Human Order Incineration Incident (although Chaldea’s Babbage is a “different person” in some sense). They often exchange greetings with one another even in Chaldea.

#### Shakespeare, Mozart

A closet fan of them as a matter of fact.

#### Lord El-Melloi II (Kongming)

They see eye to eye. They are often deep in talk in Chaldea’s lobby.

#### James Moriarty

————His greatest enemy, and his most worthy rival.
