Santa Maria - Drop Anchor.
The actualization of the most famed first voyage.
The flag ship Santa Maria that he had once sailed on appears, docks (even in the middle of the land), and then-----in accordance to his instruction, accomplishes everything it must accomplishes.
It is the order of the ship’s captain to begin the plundering: “Santa Maria, drop your anchor”.
It may just be a coincidence so that he would be considered a devout Christian, but…
One can also interpret “Santa Maria - Drop Anchor” as a slang for “O Holy Mother of Maria, go choke a darkie”.{{n1}}
