This time, I received the responsibility of a unique Servant, even within FGO. I incorporated every preference and image that I could have with grandiose dream, hope, and grand ambition of aiming for the new continent that none had ever accomplished as the foundation. I’ve had a had bunch of thinking, but I do wonder whether or not I fortunately managed to complete a beyond expectation, austere, intense never-give-up-and-your-dream-will-definitely-come-true figure of Columbus. (I would have never thought that the massive quantity of different expressions would all be accepted.) Also, I’d like to use this chance to convey my deepest gratitude towards everyone whose assistance I had received. Thank you so much. (Moto Murabito)
