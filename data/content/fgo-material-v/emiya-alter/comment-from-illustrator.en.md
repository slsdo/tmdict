Emiya who is very much out of the usual… I’ve drawn him in high spirit with who knows how many words that came out during the exchange with Type-MOON, strengthening the image of “Emiya who upon further thinking looks like a prisoner!” Afterwards, his voice, his meager setting development, as well as his story began to take form, becoming a character; his role nimbly jumps over my image of him, heading into an unthinkable, heartrending direction that left a deep impression.
