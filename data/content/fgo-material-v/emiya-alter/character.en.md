### Personality

The ally of justice who had fallen to ruins.
At the beginning, he had been a sweeper who acts under a coldheaded theory and law. However, by means of several incidents, he transforms into a satirist to the point of self-injury.
He chooses mission that must be done composedly and heartlessly, and deals with it rationally.
Even now, his recollection and ego are whittling away bit by bit; due to that, his mundane memories are poor.
It seems that he puts to his diary only things that he judges to must be recorded.

### Attitude towards Master

He holds absolutely no expectation towards the Master.
The man who speaks cynically of himself as a machine would gladly do anything, no matter how fiendish, if it’s for the sake of achieving his objective.
And of course, should avoiding fiendish method and even with a roundabout way the objective gets done, he would not stop that either.

### Dialogue Examples

“Here for revenge? Not bad. That’s a befitting last days.”
“…Did you say something, Master?
Apologies, lately I’ve had some dizzy attacks…. Even a conversation that happens just five minutes ago felt like a distant dream.”
“It’s time? Very well. Let’s go, Master.
I know. We’re doing the usual; saving the weak and crushing the strong, no? Being an ally of justice isn’t bad.
--------I don’t know why. But for some reason I feel like weeping.”
“So. The swan had thus flew away.
Avarice brings only harm. Such a frame and body would be able to neither flutter nor float away. It shall sink like the metal it is.”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

He is not the nameless that the society brought forth, but a ruined, mindless enforcer{{n1}} who threw away his own name.
His memory is damaged, and he had already lost his past.
The man continues to deride himself, who had forsaken morality, despised love, and became nothing but a living corpse.

He has no ideals, no beliefs; and thus he is efficient.
Boasting of being just like a machine, a nameless antihero.
Due to parts of his roots being corrupted, he will unfold a slaughter without mercy if it’s for the sake of accomplishing his objective.

### General Armaments

He utilizes two guns; a two sword style by means of the pair of guns “Kanshou and Bakuya”.

### Connections with Characters

#### Emiya

My past self, who put a bitter smile as if saying he can’t put a complain even if killed.{{n1}}

#### Sesshouin Kiara

I don’t have much of an opinion in matters and affairs regarding this woman.
I will simply kill her, no matter how many times, if her way of being propagates through society and brings harm to it.

#### Jaguar Man

……You, and that boy…… I……

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} With how Japanese works this is veryambigue, I can’t say who is being killed in this sentence, Emiya or Emiya, although the answer is obviously Emiya.
