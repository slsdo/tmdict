Unlimited Lost Works.
The “Infinite Swords Creation” is one of the furthest land that the magic specialized in forging swords had staked a life time to arrive at.
This reality marble accumulates within it all the weapons bearing the concept of “swords” that he had seen.
…However, this man’s “Infinite Swords Creation” arises from within the body of the opponent. The minuscule Reality Marble becomes a dreadful force within their body and rips the enemy apart.
