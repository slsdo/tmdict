### Bulletproof Treatment: A

A Skill that may very well be called “Protection from Arrows” by means of the most modern{{n1}} Heroic Spirit.
It’s designated as bulletproof, but strictly speaking most projectiles can be repelled.

### Projection Magic: C (conditionally A+)

A magic that reproduces tools by his image for but several minutes.
The pair of swords that Archer favored, Kanshou and Bakuya, was something created by means of projection magic as well.
Its rank rapidly increases only when the projection subject is categorized as “sword”.
Through the special trait of “able to prepare counterfeits many times over”, Emiya momentarily increases the power of the projected Noble Phantasms by making them crash and detonates.

Were this man not endowed with A-rank, he would not have been able to sufficiently exhibits the power of his inversion status.
