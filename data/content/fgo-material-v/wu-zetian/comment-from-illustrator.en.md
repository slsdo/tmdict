The request was an ecchi and total S loli empress. I’m doing my best for the sex appeal in a body without any sex appeal. I felt like saying that her forehead and slanted eyes must definitely go like this. If you look at it, the hair rolls are like the image of a portrait crown. The clothing on her breast is not a ribbon string, but a tube top bra… but it really looks like a string, huh… The thing that obliquely looks like a pig in the background is mascot-ified Tan{{n1}} (Chinese monster), Ton-chan. Looks good as a cushion. (Harada Takehito)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} [犭贪 (tān)](http://jwjc.gxun.edu.cn/info/1113/1284.htm), a Chinese monster with the head of a dragon, the body of a qilin. The word itself does’t appear in most dictionaries.
