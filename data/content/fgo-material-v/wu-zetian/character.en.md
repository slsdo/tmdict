### Personality

An arrogant empress, full of pride.
Devoted to her own desire, her personality is an intense one which loves from the bottom of her heart the things she loves while destroying things she finds unpleasant.
Be that as it may, she is highly intelligent and refined, able to judge what is just as just.
In addition, while she may insist on her own way as the empress.
She is by no means a foolish one.
Even though she encourages of torture and incrimination, she in facts possesses a defined ability in managing the state.

### Attitude towards Master

Her wish towards the Holy Grail is, of course, “another chance for her country”.

She treats the Master as “a useful personage for the time she would build her country”.
Like a staff officer. Like We shall put you to work in Our side.
She would approve of making them the prime minister, or making them an excellent torture official, also…. beyond that, how to say this, even making them someone who is more or less her other partner.
All of it depends on how you perform form now on, so she said somewhat delightfully.

### Dialogue Examples

“Our name is Wu Zetian. To try on employing Us… quite the contrary, your arrogance has aroused Our interest!”
“Master, We are bored, truly bored. Have you no secrets information, or something of such nature, of Servants who won’t do as they are told? We would allow for their execution.”
“Fufu, have you finally been unable to hold yourself back upon Our charm?”
“Master. W-We would not be opposed to especially grant you the permission to praise upon Us, you know?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A figure from the 7th-8th century. The sole empress in the history of China.

Originally she had been a consort of the second Emperor of T’ang, Taizong. One of her concubines.
Although she had risen within the harem and was bestowed with the status of “talented one”, within Taizong’s reign she was not able to make apparent of her presence in the imperial court. To add, during the time an ominous prophecy of “After T’ang’s third generation, the queen of Wu shall prosper” had began to spread around Taizong if it were the truth.
All women in possession of that name then became shunned more than ever. In other words, she became unable to curry favor with those most important for the sake of seizing influence.

Then what should she do?
The one she then set her eyes on is Taizong’s son and crown prince, Li Zhi (the future third Emperor of T’ang, Gaozong).

Of course, a love between a consort of the emperor and the son of the emperor is not something that can be ethically allowed.
However, through making use of all manners of wiles and deceit, stabbing through the crack in the system and morality, as well as utilizing the antagonism between Gaozong’s wife, Empress Wang, and Gaozong’s favored mistress, Consort Xiao, she had managed to return to the imperial court.
Consort Wu, who had overcome many distress and managed to obtain the position which could formally receive the emperor’s favor, would then had many children with Gaozong, but-------
Before long, the flame of one life disappeared from within the mere newborn.

……What necessary for her after entering the imperial court was the elimination of obstacles.
The woman who reached out her hand to the greatest authority known as the emperor, embraced it on her chest, and eventually was in the position to snatch it, decided that she should have be the only one.
It is said that consequently, she pressed and questioned Empress Wang as a criminal who murdered her child, overthrow Consort Xiao together with Empress Wang, and then took the seat of Gaozong’s empress for herself.
At that point, on top of cutting out the limbs of Consort Xiao, she had executed her by by throwing her into a sake jar, among others.
From this flow of event, there are those who considered that perhaps she had murdered her own child and laid the blame on the empress, but-----
The truth is not certain.

To add, due to the curse of "you shall be reborn as a mouse, and I, reborn as a cat, sha bite you to death" said by the dying Consort Xiao at the time, she would thereafter completely prohibit of keeping cats in the imperial court. There is also a theory stating that she had moved the capital Chang’an to Luoyang due to fear of ghosts.

In any case, she had grasped the real power of statecraft from behind the bamboo blind; she would then murder (assassinate) any relatives who had become hindrances and her political enemies one by one.
After Gaozong’s death, she changed the name of the country to “Zhou”, finally took the throne for herself, and granted herself the title of “Shengshen Huangdi”.
Conforming to her state government, she had laid out politics of fear which encourages incrimination.
The people feared from their heart of the brutal torture by the hands of officials known as the “Ku Li”-------

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She is not someone who was born to become an empress.
She is someone who climbed to the top and reached that status through great efforts.
She herself does not feel astonished by that in the slightest.

--------She had aimed for the highest possible, and became the empress.

She had decided that she will absolutely become one, and so it was a matter of course.
She had continued to put great efforts for that, and so it was a matter of course.
Her journey, bloodied from entering the harem, becoming an adult, and obtaining power ….Put to words, it was akin to a match which result was already decided beforehand.

What is truly necessary for becoming an empress is, simply, to be determined from the beginning.

In her oppressed childhood, she had raised her eyes towards the sky and sworn so-------
Of the pure determination to obtain this country.
Of the loud determination to properly lead this country.
One can conceive that, “that moment” itself, is the highest height of her life.
Not as a title, but as a way of life-----
Because if one were to ask her of since when had she been the empress, then her answer would be since “that moment”.
Because if one were to ask her of how was she able to become the empress, then her answer would be because of “that moment”.
Because if one were to ask her of when in her life had she shined the most, then her answer would be in “that moment”.
And so, the form she materialize with was this form of a young girl.

“Well, besides that… is it not a self evident truth that a young woman is preferable to an elderly one? Kufufu--!”
