Silkweave Scripture of Incrimination.
The manual for the Ku Li (torture officials), said to be written during the era of her reign.
It is a guidance writing of torture and interrogation for the purpose of fabricating so called criminals.

This Noble Phantasm is equal to the embodiment of the national law of “her freely producing criminals.”
In other words, during the time where this Noble Phantasm is deployed, she becomes the “one who torture” everybody else and anyone confronting her unquestioningly becomes the “one who is tortured”.

By all rights, she becomes able to punishes those insolent utilizing a great variety of torture method, but recently it seems that she feels like utilizing poisons and wine jars that she once arranged to use against her former political enemies.

“Torture, torture, and even more torture! …Nyufu☆”
