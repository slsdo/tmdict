### Demon of the Battlefield: B

A Skill which rouses his allies through his personal prowess and valor. Strengthen himself as well as the troops he leads beyond their original abilities.
The way he fights, just like that of a demon, sometimes strikes fear even towards his allies.

### Disengage: C

The ability to withdraw from battle, or to reset the state of affairs. It also returns disadvantageous battle to its initial state and skill condition to its starting value.
Simultaneously, several bad statuses are compulsorily cancelled. When he was alive, every time he thought of losing he would always rise again and continue to fight.

### Military Tactics: D

A tactical, instinctive ability in regards not of one-on-one battle, but of battle involving large numbers.It grants advantageous correction in the case of using one’s own anti-army Noble Phantasm, or when dealing against the enemy’s anti-army Noble Phantasm.
(In FGO, it is fundamentally not utilized)

### Kyokuchuu Hatto{{n1}}: EX

One is to not go against the samurai code (prohibition of combats unworthy of a warrior)
One is to not to escape from the office (prohibition of rescinding one’s contract)
One is to not raise money on their own accord (prohibition of furnishing materials from others)
One is to not handle litigations on their own accord (prohibition of rescinding combat status by means of negotiation)
One is to not engage in personal battles (prohibition of battles outside of the Master’s instruction)

A Skill that places compulsory restraints upon oneself. He would receive damage should he breach those prohibitions; however, his statuses would rise in exchange. Breaching all prohibitions would render him immobile.
Normally, breaching the prohibitions that which a Shinsengumi regimental soldier would have never been allowed to breach would gradually render one insane.
It is the embodiment of his resolution and madness; of one who still aspires to be Shinsengumi, even after he threw away his pride as a warrior.
