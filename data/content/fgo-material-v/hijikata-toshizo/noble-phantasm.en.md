Shinsengumi.
The flag of fidelity is him, him alone; and for as long as he is here, it shall never die. The Noble Phantasm in which his intense pride and madness interweave.
Even within his corps, by no means he is their better in terms of sword skills; however, regardless of friend or foe, all profess thus: “I may not lose against Hijikata, but neither do I feel I would be able to win”. Such was the sword of carnage belonging to the war demon, Hijikata Toshizou.
Upon invocation, degradation of physical abilities due to bodily injury is temporarily made invalid; it makes it possible for him to use any means and to continue fighting until all enemies’ are slaughtered. However, it is a double-edged sword which bursts all damage received in one go when its period of effect ends.
Such was truly the reappearance of his lifetime, in which he never ceased fighting. When invoked, his surrounding transforms into a battlefield where bullets fly about as guns roar. It displays the aspect of an anti-army Noble Phantasm through a large number summoning, yet its true essence is something completely different. All of it is a manifestation of his madness, in which “even now, Shinsengumi is here.”

“Shinsengumi… is… here…, Shinsengumi… IS…. ME!!!”
