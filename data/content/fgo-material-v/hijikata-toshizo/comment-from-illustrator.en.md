When this conversation was brought to me at the beginning, I didn’t know the Servant’s true name yet. After I officially took the contract, I was glad when I found out it was Hijikata Toshizou.
I’m from Hokkaido myself, so I’ve made way to the Goryoukaku plenty of times already, plus he’s also my favorite Shinsengumi figure. I’ve had plenty of fun drawing him. (Yogo Yuuki)
