### Magical Resistance: B

Nullifies spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. Even if targeted by the likes of Great Magecrafts and Greater Rituals, it is difficult for her to be damaged by them.
… Because she is being tainted by a dark attribute, her Magical Resistance has declined a rank.

### Riding: B

The ability for riding. Most vehicles and beasts can be managed with above-average skill, even those that did not exist in the time period one lived in for they are not an exception to this Skill.
Large motorbikes can also be handled as a matter of course. Speaking of Alter, her motorbike is a cuirassier.

### Independent Action: EX

The ability to be able to act even with the absence of one’s Master.
Although there is a master she ought to serve, that is a separate matter. She acquired the menacing Independent Action Skill from the belief that a maid’s service mentality should be free… a service that should be voluntary, and not to be forced into doing by anyone else. As a result of possessing this Skill, her normal parameters have lowered somewhat.
