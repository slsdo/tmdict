For Swimsuit Alter, I got to send out all the design materials I wanted to do. The fact is, the maid component was planned to be one of those materials, but it should be said that it was to be expected, for that became the attire that has the most impact, don’t you think? She became quite the luxurious character where even her motions change in each of her Saint Graph stages. For the design of Alter’s water gun, I got Mr. Yukio Hirai to be in charge of that. In each stage, actual firearms were used as the motifs, and I got to settle the designs by mixing in an Altered composition into them. (Takeuchi Takashi)
