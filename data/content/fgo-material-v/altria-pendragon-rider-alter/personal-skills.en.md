### Summer Sweeper!: A

A Magical Burst Skill that has been transformed for a maid’s use.
An expert at washing anything away with cold water. While increasing her own serviceability (the ability to quickly perform service well), she strictly supervises the whole party, improving their morale.

### Coaching: A

The Artoria Alter of the seaside is also a cold-blooded governess (female private tutor). By means of a strict education and guidance, she corrects erroneous battle styles. Since she is quite Spartan, those coached by her incur great damage.
It is a rare Skill called ‘Skill Recharge’, but it is difficult to use. Maid is not fit to be a meathead though, so she can use it despite its difficulty.

### Reloaded: C

The water gun Alter fires can have her magical energy added to its shots; something like Magical Burst (Water) so to speak, and yet this is something even more elaborately applied compared to that. Given that its recharge time is short, it is fine to either use it without reserve, or to aim for a one-hit kill by using Coaching on herself together with this to pile up the magical energy from a double reload into a single bullet – a Heartbreak Bullet. This is the maid etiquette from Maid’s home of England.
