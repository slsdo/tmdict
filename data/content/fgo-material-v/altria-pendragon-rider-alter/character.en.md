### Personality

Alter, who is a different side of the King of Britain – Artoria Pendragon, has again awakened to another conviction. Welcoming summer, Artoria was encouraged by re-examining herself not as simply a tyrant, but as a mere waitress. “I follow what’s being said, but I really don’t follow how it resulted in such a thing.” In order to make the summer the Master is spending time for something even better, she, of course, chose the path of a maid. Because said person intends to hide the fact that she is Artoria, she is disguising even her equipment as various objects.

Excalibur as a mop. Secace as a pistol. Her combat style converted to that of a modern soldier’s.
Mowing down opponents with a mop, stopping their movements with a pistol, and blowing them up with grenades.
Such is a maid.

### Attitude towards Master

Artoria Alter declares that she serves not as a Servant, but as a maid. And as the person in charge of their education, she supervises the Master around the clock for the sake of making them into a Master who can stand on their own; a Spartan maid. She assesses that her cold-hearted behaviour and strict words are all for the Master’s future. She has a summer sweeper (cleaning shop) as well, making use of it to remove anything and everything that would become an obstacle to the Master with all her energy. Since there is no king’s crown with her, there will also be a girlish side to her appropriate for her age that appears more often than the times when she was in the Saber Class. Though she will coolly pout if that does not matter to the Master.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Rider. I am Artoria Pendragon. Since I came here, I will get you to prepare for the ideal livelihood. I will not allow you to go back to sleep nor permit a lack of exercise. Cleaning and laundry are to be done thoroughly. And c-cooking… I can do too; I will show you what I can do… within my scope.”
“Hah. It is also natural to be surprised. For you see, even I am surprised. Contrary to expectations, a swimsuit is fine too!”
“I appear before you in a new Class. And I shall get the better of this Ishtar Cup and whatnot, and then shall I reign as the strongest maid.”
“I am serving you as a maid. Therefore, I cannot turn a blind eye to a negligence of duties.
————Go on, get out there and get to work!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Even if it is Alter, she will wear a swimsuit. It is summer after all. But because of some kind of conviction she found, she had put away the king’s crown and had instead put on a touchingly lovely white crown————a white brim.
Yes. She is a maid.

Tempted by the magical energy of summer (though the person herself has not realized nor will she speak of it), Alter completely changed her clothes for a swimsuit.
“I am absolutely not what you would commonly call a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit. If you want to know why, it is because before being a Swimsuit Heroic Spirit, I am firstly a maid.”
Indeed, it is a sound argument that leaves one lost for words. However, her personality, which was already too serious since the beginning, got even more serious by becoming a maid. She changed into a Demonic Head Maid who will in no way overlook the undisciplined Master.

Artoria Alter enters the Ishtar Cup together with Nero. Their team name “Tyrant Shooting Star” was her idea. It is a fitting name for a miraculous team in which a famously selfish emperor and a tyrant maid joined hands.

Concerning the race, Artoria Alter’s motive for entering it is to show everyone that she is the strongest. She justifiably wants a (physical) reward, but apart from that, she feels it is fine to participate since it is on behalf of the Master.

Nero regards that “all the other teams are rivals”, but for Alter, there is no team that would make her feel the emotion of “I definitely cannot be defeated by these fellows.” Nero and Alter. Although they are a pair whose rhythms do not match with each other since Nero aims to actively participate and have fun in the race while Artoria aims to vent out her violent impulses (stress) and win the reward, they still joined forces to participate in the Ishtar Cup.

Artoria Alter has no motivation at all to probe into the truth hidden within the race. Because she is under the impression that she is being cheered on the most by the Protagonist, her spirit happens to be constantly in a good mood. Though such a thing really cannot be seen from her outward appearances.

Artoria Alter’s racing policy is “to race without going easy on anyone.” Nero steps on the accelerator without thinking of the consequences, and Alter uses the nitro despite thinking about the consequences. Nero views “Beauty and Speed” as supreme, while Alter views “Simplicity and Speed” as supreme. One half of their views are in conflict, but because the other half perfectly have the same rhythm, they are two people who staggeringly got along well with each other as a matter of fact… As expected, is this not a miraculous team then?

### Connections with Characters

#### Nero (Caster)

An intolerable teammate. Something like a Roman Emperor is nothing more than a target to rebel against. But anyhow, Artoria Alter cannot help but acknowledge Nero’s talent in celebrating life.
