The Noble Phantasm that embodies the “planetary destruction” Moriarty aims for. Because he was summoned as a Servant, it is being confined to “Anti-Army”, but if its power is amplified, its range can extend to “Anti-City”, “Anti-Country”. Piercing the earth with an enormous pile bunker, everything is swallowed up by the resulting fissures in the ground.

In the Shinjuku Chapter, by using this Noble Phantasm to its greatest extent, it took another step closer to achieving the destruction of the Protagonist and the planet.
