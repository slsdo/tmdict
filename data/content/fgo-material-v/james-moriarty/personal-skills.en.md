### Magic Bullet Shooter: EX

The ability to fire magic bullets to shoot down targets and even overcome any kind of obstacle.

It is actually a Skill not from Moriarty, but from Der Freischütz.

### The End of the Spider Thread: A++

The faculty to scheme evil. Disrupting order, contaminating goodness, and not causing fate and punishment to face towards oneself. Like a web made by a spider, the evil schemes capture the opponents and causes them to fall.

### Charisma of a Wicked Intellectual: A

A tremendous Charisma owned not by one who manages a state, but only by one who is at the top of an evil organization.

With Moriarty’s evil Charisma at the Rank of A, it is even feasible for him to control not just the United Kingdom, but the whole world from the shadows.
