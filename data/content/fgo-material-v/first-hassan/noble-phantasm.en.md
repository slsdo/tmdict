Azrael.
Decapitation with an ordinary large sword.
It is ingrained with the faith that this individual continued to believe in, and spent a lifetime wielding.

For those who lose their lives to this sword, they say there is fear, but no pain, there is dread, but no suffering, there is repentance, but no regrets.
