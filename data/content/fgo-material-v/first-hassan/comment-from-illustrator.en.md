When it comes to his outward appearance, first was the impression of a “Knight Hassan” so the first draft gave off the feeling a knight in full armor equipped with the mask the other Hassans wear, but he received a revision to strengthen the elements of “Grim Reaper” and “skull”, resulting in his current appearance. Anyway, I am delighted that I could cram all the elements I like into him. (Ryota-H)
