### Personality

Due to his fiendish outward appearance​ and fierce manner of fighting, he’s pictured with a ruthless nature, but the individual in question is just silent, with a noble disposition that strictly adheres to the Lord’s teachings.
Well-versed in both the law of men and the law of God, he perceives “the suspension of life activities” and “the end of life” as different things.
By God’s will, the soul is brought salvation at the end of one’s life.
As long as they don’t go against the teachings, this individual will be the ally of a righteous person. However, since he absolutely won’t show any mercy or consideration, he’ll spread fear and dread in battle as if he was the Grim Reaper itself.
It is rare for him to say anything, however his intention will be clearly conveyed.
When mad, the (skull’s) eyes will shine. When sad, the eyes will shine. Even when pleased, the eyes will shine. No matter what, the eyes will shine.
He holds no interest in the other Heroic Spirits and he does not convey his views, thoughts and desires to others.
However, towards the other Hassans, he becomes a strict Senpai to the point of being relentless.
「Cursed Arm. What didst thou seek to grasp, to the extent of obtaining that devil’s arm? Thine own foolishness? Very well, hand over thy head.」
「Hundred Faces. What hast thou accumulated with thy countless knowledge? A desire to contend thy hundred souls for a single truth? How shallow. Now, hand over thy head.」
No matter what you do, your head will be lopped off.

### Attitude towards Master

A knight of terror (dread knight) who does not display any loyalty, but answers the trust placed in him with his all of his soul.
This swordsman, who once turned all of his faith into a sword, continues to condemn the evil of this world in the name of the Lord.
What is evil?
Those diseased beings who do not concern themselves with the Lord’s authority and the righteous actions of man.
He shows no mercy for evil.
For argument’s sake, he would cut down even a believer if there was something evil inside them. For God does not perform evil. That is a false believer, in other words, the most wicked evil on this world.

### Dialogue Examples

「―――――――――」
「Call me as thou pleases. I hadst no name from the beginning. There is no insistence or agreement.」
「The setting sun that is rewarded with vanishing in the mountain range upon the battle’s conclusion. That is thou.」
「Be at ease. Hand over thy head.」
「Dost thou hear hear the bell announcing death? Thy overdue disappearance is forgiven. God’s will has finally reached thou.」
「Mine aspect is the death of the Old Man. Mine sword is the verdict of the Old Man. For the Old Men of the Mountain, I am Old Man of the Mountain. ――――In other words, the Hassan who executes Hassans.」

### Historical Image · Character Image

The assassin wearing a skull mask.
Regarded as the first Hassan Sabbah, who was born when the name “Old Man of the Mountain” changed into a title, after the assassination cult became established as assassins.
However, it has been said that neither the other 18 Hassans nor the followers of the cult knew this individual’s true identity and proof of his existence was nowhere to be found.
The legendary assassin said to appear to take the head of a generation’s Hassan-i-Sabbah when they go against the teachings.
In other words, a Hassan who executes Hassans.

Supposedly there was not a single eye-witness within the assassination cult who saw him, which is as it should be - one’s life would be forfeit from the moment they laid eyes on this individual.
He, who was the origin of the “Old Man of the Mountain”, also chose the life of a guardian who convicts the corruption of the religious organization at the same time.
Even if the cult is righteous according to the teachings of God, that does not change the fact that their deeds as human beings are evil. Therefore, this individual could not forgive the cult becoming corrupt.
For those who protect the teachings of God to drown in human cravings.
That, in particular, is the greatest blasphemy against God.
The corruption of the cult is, namely, the degradation of its top, the “Old Man of the Mountain”.
Regardless of whether it is the degradation of the mind or of the skills, the name of “Old Man of the Mountain” is not bestowed upon one who has declined.
Decline is, in other words, death. The severing of one’s head is a pardon for their sins and a hope to be entrusted to the next “Old Man of the Mountain”.
In order to provide a just cause for this failure of a role of assassinating assassins, this individual chose not concealed weapons and assassination tools, but to openly fight with a large sword.
When someone catches sight of this skull, that means the end of that person.
After he has handed down the verdict upon the fool who broke the religious organization’s dogma, those who have seen the figure of the swordsman of the skull disappear from this world. Having buried many assassins, he is said to be concealed in the darkness of the Order of Assassins until the day of its destruction.
The living legends, the abyss of assassins of whom nobody exists as an eye-witness.
Such is this swordsman of the skull.

### Role within the Game

Introduced in Chapter 6 of Part 1, the individual standing at the summit of assassins.
Since he is legend who’s dead while alive, he can be summoned in Chaldea if the person himself feels like it; this is the sort of out-of-the-norm Heroic Spirit he is.
Merlin who can not fade away until the extinction of mankind and “The Old Man of the Mountain” who continues to wander the boundary between life and death are both those who travel eternally and because of this it seems like they are somewhat kindred spirits.
Named “King Hassan” in chapter 6 by the Protagonist who does not know much about Magecraft, but with a “I do not mind being called that”, he easily accepted it, and from there on, there were many times when he was referred to as that.
In order to return the favour to the Master of Chaldea who broke into the hearts of the mountainfolk, and also broke through the Lion King, throwing away his grand title, he became the sword of the summoner, known as “The Old Man of the Mountain”.
This is a bit of a digression, but in the early days of FGO’s development, even a special summoning banner was taking into consideration.
It was an idea where, by collecting one hundred Hassans (any kind of Hassans) and fusing them, you could summon him.
『Oh…? The Hassans are…?
A unique SSR Servant that anybody can get if they just persevere, one you can obtain even if you have no luck!
His name is Ki\~ng Hassa\~n!』
……It was the model example for something interesting that can not be put into practice.

### Connections with Characters

#### Hassans of the successive generations

As the Founder, he scolds the Old Men who did a poor job. It goes without saying that scolding = death.

#### Ereshkigal

The teachings might be different, but from her belief and obligation towards death he feels something virtuous.
If Chaldea were to be involved with the “Land of Death” once again, if she was also present, there would be no role for him to play, is what he thinks.

#### Nitocris

The teachings are different, but her decorum towards the “deceased”, the attitude of a ruler, is something to which he can nod in approval.
If Chaldea were to be involved with the “Land of Death” once again and she was all alone by herself at that time, the burden might be bit too much for her…is the concern{{n1}} he feels for her.

#### ??? (The name is censored)

“O Smoking Mirror. Killing for the sake of killing. Existing to die. If that is thine faith, I am unable to dispute it.”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Gotta love the Japanese word (“老婆心”) for “concern” here. It’s made up of the kanjis for “old”, “old woman/grandma” and “heart/mind”.
