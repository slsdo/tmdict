### Personality

A hero who loves goodness and believes in justice. It is possible to say that in a certain sense, Arthur is one of the forms of a completed “Ally of Justice”{{n1}}.

Arthur was once taken prisoner by a strong wish to save his native land, but he is now different. His soul has been set free, and there will never be a time where that sword will lose its way again. If the person standing before his very eyes is an evil one who torments the people, he will surely oppose that person, no matter how powerful that opponent is, and will definitely defeat them.

He is kind and sincere to those who should be protected. And he is stern when he ought to ascertain if one is an opponent. Arthur’s response is easy to understand. Does he deal with them with love, or does he deal with them with the sword?

### Attitude towards Master

Arthur has the utmost trust in his Master. Deception and betrayal are improbable from him.

Arthur does not have a wish he wants to make on the Holy Grail. For he has already been liberated from that wish. According to records, he had participated in two Holy Grail Wars. He had thrown himself into the second conflict surely not because of a wish, but to “protect” something. And now, he tackles a third conflict.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am Saber. A Servant————who will protect you, and the world.”
“This radiance, I shall show it to you.”
“You have the power to fight. I do mean the skills you have too, but I am of the impression that… in your heart, you have a sword.”
“I will certainly cut them down!”
“Releasing the Thirteen Restraints (Seal Thirteen)————Commencing the Round Table’s Decision (Decision Start)!”

### Character Image

Valuing those that are virtuous, ascertaining those that are atrocious. A hero who is like a knight in shining armour that anyone would dream of as a child. He is also called the Holy Sword Wielder of the Planet. His true identity is said to be the “Knight King” of a parallel universe who found his way to this world by pursuing an existence of some kind. For a certain objective, Arthur visited this world. That is, it is said to be something related to the Beast of Calamity————

<>

The Knight King who continued to fight together with the Knights of the Round Table, the rise and fall of his native land of Britain hanging in the balance. He materializes while evidently taking a pure and unselfish appearance that can be described as the “ideal prince” or a “knight of sky silver”. Although he is the real King Arthur, a hero who possesses almost the same anecdotes and past as Heroic Spirit Artoria Pendragon, as an existence, he is an entirely different person who belongs to a world different from the world in “Fate/Grand Order”.

Arthur himself arrived in this world from another world/a parallel universe, chasing after a certain powerful opponent, an evil omen————or so he tells. Perhaps the evil omen is considered to be a body of a Beast. They are words so astonishing, a judgement cannot be acquired on whether they are true or not, even with Chaldea’s system, but he will at least not tell lies to the Master.

### Connections with Characters

#### Brynhildr, Jekyll

Arthur worries about their unstable Saint Graphs. He also feels responsible for them.

#### Ozymandias

Their relationship is quite tense. If the balance collapses for a moment, it seems a raging sun will come and descend from the sky.

#### Arash, Heracles

Great heroes whom Arthur respects from his heart.

#### Gilgamesh (Prototype)

The Hero King from a parallel universe.

“There should explicitly be nothing serious for him to appear here nowadays… and, I am very careless. How naïve of me.”

#### Cú Chulainn (Prototype)

A hero who Arthur once had a mutual dispute with, but in the end, they ended up uniting on a common front. He wanted to talk to Cú once the situation calmed down… but they continued to pass by each other, so they have not been able to talk at ease yet.

#### Round Table Servants

Every time he sees their figures, Arthur unconsciously shows a small smile.

#### Mordred

Arthur is not able to ignore her, even if he understands that Mordred is a different person compared to the one he knows. He often greets her.

#### Artoria / Merlin

“A different me, and a different Mage of Flowers.”

Arthur has quite a curiosity about their very existences, but it would be very impolite of him to inquire about stories for this and that, so he restrains himself.

#### ???

A Beast of Calamity. Arthur defeated it twice. It should have been destroyed completely. It should be essentially impossible for something like a third time, but————for the sake of protecting those he loves, Arthur Pendragon will wield the Holy Sword of the Planet against it once again.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} While the Japanese term 正義の味方 (seigi no mikata) is commonly translated and widely known to the Fate fanbase as “Ally of Justice”, “Champion of Justice” or “Knight in Shining Armour” can also be used as the translation for this term and those would be more appropriate here for Arthur.
