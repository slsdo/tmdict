Here is Mr. Arthur who I received, of whom I drew for a long time since the light novels and of whom I am already experienced with in drawing, but in FGO, there is a memory where I awfully struggled with him in that I simply cannot finish off a drawing of his standing pose that could reach a very satisfactory level to me. Being on the verge of tears, suddenly, “THIS!! How is this fellow absolutely cool now??!!” And I then happened to submit the drawings of his current standing pose. Yeaaah, he is cool YOU KNOW~ (tell me it is true).

I think it is an interesting as well as an unfair point for the expressions he shown to each of his Masters in the year 1991, the year 1999, and now in the Grand Orders to be all different from each other. And it is really unfair in that he had just reached the point where he can make macaroni gratin. (Nakahara)
