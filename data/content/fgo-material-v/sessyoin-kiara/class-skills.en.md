### Authority of the Beast: D

A skill that can surely be called Anti-Humanity.
Due to changing from a Beast into an Alter Ego, the rank has dropped significantly.
Benefits similar to those of a regular B-rank Independent Action are obtained.

### Independent Manifestation: E

Self-sealed due to changing into the Alter Ego class. “Self-restraint” is how one could put it.
Nonetheless, she possesses the “instant death resistance” and “charm resistance” that comes with Independent Manifestation.
In particular, she is 300% resistant to the charm debuff.

### Logos Eater: C

The special trait of the Pleasure Deva. Provides a damage buff against any sentient being that possesses intelligence (pleasure), regardless of scale or structure.
However, due to her current state as an Alter Ego, this skill also had its rank lowered. Currently, even that special trait is only comparable to touching. It’s no different from foreplay.
Since Beast III is the love for humanity, naturally, it loves humans.
However, for Kiara, she, alone, is human. To Kiara, other people are nothing but toys used to satisfy herself, the human.

### Nega Saver: A

The fate of the beast who tried to bring salvation only to her own world, while possessing the qualifications to be a messiah (Saver).
Every skill possessed by the Saver and Ruler class is nullified, targets with magic stat not exceeding A rank are charmed with a 300% probability and the effect of buffs cast by Kiara are increased by 200%.
Although the scale of the existence of the Pleasure Deva that was born once on the moon is superior to Beast III, they say that she had no choice but to withdraw when faced with a messiah since she did not possess this skill.
