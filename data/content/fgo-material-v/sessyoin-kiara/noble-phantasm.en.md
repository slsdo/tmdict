Amida Amidula・Heaven’s Hole.
Anti-Human Order, or maybe Anti-Grand Noble Phantasm.
The Noble Phantasm for Beast III’s exclusive-use, which breeds a virtually infinite amount of demon pillars within her own body.
The inside of her body has already become a single universe, the Sukhavati.{{n1}}
Those brought inside her will disappear from reality, having their egos removed and their reason melted away.
No matter what kind of robust body or defensive armor one might have, they are meaningless inside Kiara’s body; they are all rendered powerless like a newborn existence and liberated from earthly desires and the woes of man.
Beast III is the “hole” itself that was formed in reality, and those who fall into this hole taste the greatest pleasure imaginable right before disappearing and are absorbed by Kiara while drowning in ecstasy.
Depending on how you look at it, this end of being released from the world of suffering called reality could be called salvation.
In FGO, it deals damage that ignores defense and pierces invincibility. It also recovers one’s HP by the means of ecstasy.
In addition, as a hidden trait, it deals bonus damage to the Grand-class.
