### Clairvoyance (Beast): D

The rank of her Clairvoyance is low so she cannot see far without obstruction.
Nevertheless, she can see through and reveal the desires and true nature of the humans before her eyes.
…That in itself would be the skill of a sage, but by revealing the animalistic and true nature of the other party, Kiara is aroused, gaining overwhelming joy from the procedure. Just like a poisonous snake licking her lips in front of her prey.
In FGO, it drastically reduces a single target’s debuff resistance and charges one’s own NP gauge. Moreover, it’s even capable of reducing their Arts resistance.
 
### Thesis of the Still Heart (Five Thought-Stopping Meditations): A

Gojoshinkan.{{n1}} Health-care software developed by Sesshouin Kiara.
With the cyber magic formula (Codecast) developed with the purpose of taking care of one’s mental health, it measures the stagnation and disturbances of the spirit and then physically removes them to stabilize it.
Originally created in order to produce a map of the patient’s spirit to help understand it.
By nature, the tumor of the consciousness’ depths (SG) is something meant to be slowly brought to the surface, but with the Thesis of the Still Heart it is possible to detect it and swiftly pluck it out.
Although the SG is a secret, it is also a matter to be disclosed.
Anybody would want to guard their secrets, but, at the same time, they would also want someone know about them.
A heart that persists in guarding its secrets is “pitiful”.
Humans are creatures who want comfort. Because it’s a secret they don’t want anyone to know about, they have to confide in someone, be understood and ask for forgiveness. The Thesis of the Still Heart was created with the goal of granting the desire held in the depths of the heart, the true mutual understanding of the people…is what Kiara claims.
In FGO, it reduces the NP gauge of every enemy and their defenses.

### Goddess Metamorphosis: EX

A skill where one undergoes metamorphosis into a god.
A treasure trove of powerful buffs. Similar to Tamamo (Swimsuit)’s Goddess Metamorphosis.
However, this has no stun the following turn; it reduces her HP instead.

### The Ceremony of the Human Order’s Ascension to Heaven: A

By absorbing Zepar and raising Demon God Pillars inside her body, Kiara turned into a person with supernatural powers that can control Demon God Pillars.
The ones Kiara controls are not the “72 Demon God Pillars”, but “Demon God Pillars who possess no name or personality”. However, these numbers that one could call infinite, Kiara can control at will.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} So apparently, in [nenbutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nianfo), there is a method of contemplation where the mind is suspended to see things more correctly called “gojoshinkan” (五停心観).
