### Tool Creation: A

She can manufacture various items as a last boss-type underclassman. Every one of these items can exhibit a tremendous effect, so for that reason, they can even ruin the user if one misuses them. To humans who cannot “control their desires”, the items are no more than objects that cannot be handled properly, but BB will usually present these items to such humans.

### Territory Creation: A

She can construct powerful territories as a ruler-type underclassman. The Sakura Dungeon that makes a girl’s heart into a protective wall, areas with the Sakura Rules – 25 prohibitive rules where if violated, causes the violator to die – the Dog Space that forces one to live out a life of crawling on all fours, the Cattle Space that forces one to live out a lazy life where they can only eat and sleep, the Bug Space that shrinks one to the size of a bug and breeds them as such, the nostalgic old school building that can protect her precious ones, and so on, as though there is nothing she cannot do.

### Magical Resistance: B

Nullifies spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. Even if targeted by the likes of Great Magecrafts and Greater Rituals, it is difficult to be damaged by them.
