Whenever I see her now, I think… ‘Just to be frank for a moment, but I wonder if I drew her eyes too big…’! But they’re cute! I’ve been drawing them to be cute! It’s okay! KOUHAI’S OKAY!!!!!
I altered some details of her outfit from the original CCC Story in order to make her look nice for the time when she’s made into a battle sprite. Such as, the embroidered badge and her knee-high stockings. I even got to draw Nurse BB and she was very fun to do as well. I was surprised when I first saw her Noble Phantasm, and it’s wonderful~ I was also happy to see the BB Channel again after a long time I tell you~ (Wada Arco)
