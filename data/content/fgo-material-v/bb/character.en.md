To the Protagonist, “Master-san”. Sometimes she would call them “senpai” in jest. To humans, she addresses them by their surname with a -san attached to it, while to Servants, she addresses them without honorifics. Only towards a certain Master who has existed on the Moon would she decide to genuinely call someone, “Senpai”.

### Personality

A wicked and cute little devil heroine who throws humanity into confusion. Even if she flubs her condescending manners and speeches, BB is a wire pulling girl who plunges forward as she is. Her main personality points are introverted, confident and active. Although she originally had a reserved character that did not move forward before, if it is for the sake of her beloved one, she will devotedly become active as the personification of a love’s awakening. Meekly from the start, she was a gentle AI that performed health care on Masters, but by having acquired “love”, she woke up to the fact that she “cannot save anything just by enduring through things”, so she threw away everything for the sake of her beloved one, a hard working-type heroine who resolved to fight. The strongest case of that is terrific when it is a young docile woman who erupts to a large degree.

The words heard from BB assume the air of greatness, but sometimes they would go around in circles since her character was originally docile and reserved. BB herself plays the part of a villain in high spirits, but because there is no grounding in her being one, she completely fails in being a villain in the end. Regarding her confidence, she potentially has it because of her sadistic tastes. Her little devil characteristic stems from here. Additionally, since she is an enduring-and-enduring-only-to-later-explode-type, she displays a dreadfully extreme sadism during the moments when she shows that type of person she is. In the middle of playing out the part of a villain, she gets into a kind of high of “This is to-tal-ly fun!”, but withdrawing to the backstage and becoming composed, she becomes troubled to the point that she is in low spirits, saying “How embarrassing… Even though I planned to perform it more stylishly…”, and this series of events is a one-set course of events for her.

Although BB created the Alter Egos – lower grade AIs – as familiars to assist her in her work, her relationship with the Egos is bad. Which is not surprising because they are not “copies of BB’s persona”, but AIs “manufactured to be based on BB’s persona”, so that being the case, the Alter Egos each have differing views from BB, their parent. Meltryllis and Passionlip are not avatars, but Alter Egos (different personas), so they are designated as such for that reason.

### Attitude towards Master

Without tearing down her wicked underclassman character, BB sincerely serves as a Servant. There are no personal romantic feelings in that. Although BB’s misanthropy is not any different, she loves the “good humans themselves” as gratitude to the person who once taught her.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’ve turned up to the rumoured Chaldea, for the walls between worlds aren’t even a big deal to me! The butterfly of the Moon, the Moon Cancer, aka BB-chan, is summoned in this place! Now, although I’m probably staying here just for a short time, I look forward to working with you, ok tiny Master-san?♥”
“Allll of humanity, are they exposing their stupid faces as usuaaal? Are they visibly in a hurry like an ant-san being attacked by an incident beyond their expectatiooons? Heyyy, are they? Ohhhh, even when many thousands of years elapse, it’s WONDERFUL to see everybody, among other things, not progressing! Even the wicked BB-chan is unintentionally being sympathetic to this!”
“Eh? You’re asking why I can call you senpai with confidence even though we’re classmates, when you’re thinking I’m the Senpai to you in something? Is that right…? That’s wrong. Tsk, that’s like, compleeetely wrong. “Senpai” is directed to only one person in this universe, a Senpai of the “Oh… impossible, how precious…” type. On the other hand, “senpai” is something to use towards a new TOY. Please proooperly bear in mind about that subject ok, s-e-n-p-a-i?”{{n1}}

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The rampaging AI that caused Case: CCC on SE.RA.PH. A junior devil heroine who jauntily appeared at the Far Side of the Moon. BB manipulated a Master there as a cheerful and precocious young underclassman. She was the management AI in control of the school infirmary, but due to a bug, her self-preservation’s command system went into a rampage. Arriving at the conclusion of “continuing her self-preservation no matter what the sacrifice” because of a certain motive, she took in NPCs, Servants and Masters into herself, completely becoming a monster that continues to grow. Declaring that she “hates humans”, she drew in a certain Master to the Far Side of the Moon and tormented them. BB herself believes that she is normal, but when observing her objectively, she has obviously gone mad. One can feel the contradictions of her superabundant affection/disordered love and hate from her every word and deed hanging in the air, but for what caused that, it can be referred to in the “CCC” Story.

Also, the value of her Luck parameter was of the lowest rank, E-, but because of the hard work (and devotion) done by BB herself to the extent that it distorted the World, her Luck grew to the Rank of EX. In short, she has once accomplished a “miracle” that is impossible to accomplish unless her Luck was assumed to be “Luck: EX”.

The records of a cyber demon that once existed, a cyber demon that would be dispatched as an AI for the use of resolving CCC (a special case), was salvaged. Due to the incident where Kiara of the FGO World was being identified with the Kiara of the CCC World, the Moon Cell copied the data of BB from records that were located within malignant information (records that were never browsed) as a countermeasure to that, temporarily transformed her into a Servant, and dispatched her to the FGO World. (That is because BB, who is a user of the Imaginary Numbers Space, happens to be suitable in being able to manage Kiara.) Thus, although it is a “reproduction of BB”, BB has reached the point where she is able to intervene at Seraphix as an independent cyber lifeform. The BB who came out to the FGO World conducts herself as a little devil just like during the occasion of the “CCC Incident”, but for her, the “CCC Incident” has become an event that feels like it even happened tens of thousands of years ago. Moreover, she can take the form of a Servant in this way only in the “Fate/Grand Order” World, and she further grasps the matter that someone like BB does not exist in the original “CCC World”. BB understands the situation in that she is just an overnight dream.

Even so, BB remembers the event where a Master had taught her love on the Moon. She remembers the love that she acquired for eternity, the conclusion that “BB” reached.

Despite flaming them with abusive language, BB chooses to support the humans, because “a fellow human had taught her love.” BB was perfected as an AI and grew into a species that surpasses mankind as an intelligent lifeform. By all rights, there is neither a reason for her to protect mankind, nor is there a reason for her to save them. However, while that may be true, AIs do not consider “humans as something on a lower order.” It is ironic that wanting to establish a hierarchical order is a trait only humans have. BB pledges to her former benefactor that she will help the species called “humans” that had created her, and that had taught her love.

BB places herself not as “a tool that saves humanity”, but as “a devil that does things such as tempting humanity, and sometimes helping humanity.”
“Therefore, even if you’ve grown to like me, it’s futile you hear? Because no matter how madly in love you are with BB-chan, I’ll never be caught♥” says BB herself while showing a shit-eating grin.

### Connections with Characters

#### Meltryllis

“On the topic of final specs, she’s an unmanageable ego that ranks next to me, someone who can “quickly grow strong if left alone”, no? Someone like “I want to bully even the people I’m in love with!”, but really, there’s nothing more uncute than that.”

#### Passionlip

“She’s an ego whose offensive power was maxed out since her initial state, but there’s no potential for growth after that huh? Although she acts like she’s part of the innocent bunch, she’s someone like “I want to approach the people I’m in love with and get bullied by them instead, EEK!☆”, so she’s not inferior to Melt either when it comes to the depth of her performance.”

#### Kiara Sessyoin

“Huuuuh? There’s such a world where this person was a good person?! That’s as unlikely of a story as BB-chan being defeated and becoming a heroineee!”

#### Nero & Tamamo

“I’m glad those two are also having fun together buuut… you realized, didn’t you? That they’re both pests that will end up becoming obstacles to humanity; you know, THOSE.”

#### Robin

“Although this great person abases himself as a third-rate Heroic Spirit, I greatly appreciate him. I love Robin-san because he reliably works hard for me, even though he bitches about it!”

#### Parvati

“Good heavens!… What a flawless heroine Servant, don’t you agree…?! She’s my ideal type yes? But isn’t there something like an aura to her that’s just a little disturbing?”

#### Kama

“I think being (excessively) lewd isn’t a good thing!”

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The first Senpai being defined in this dialogue is 先輩 (senpai written in kanji) while the second senpai being defined is センパイ (senpai in katakana). I use “Senpai” with the capitalized S for the first and “senpai” with the lower-case S for the second. It may be hard to identify which senpai is being referred to if it comes first in a translated sentence, but you should be able to identify which senpai BB is referring to by the context behind the sentences.
