Cursed Cupid Cleanser.

It was once a Noble Phantasm called the Spiritron Imaginary Trap (Cursed Cutting Crater) that BB operated, but she has now brought out a new technique with a shit-eating grin, saying “Since I used, that, so many times by now, I got tired of it. The theme this time is ‘Cute & Curelize’! Oh, but you should know by now that just because I became everybody’s ally doesn’t mean the ‘Cursed’ part disappears from the name. BB-chan’s curse is eternal!”

Drawing out the Moon Cell’s power, she changes into the form of an invincible nurse. Dressed as she is, she draws out malignant information from the Imaginary Numbers Space, which is her domain, and overwrites the surrounding channel (the collective consciousness) into something chaotic. Expanding the Reality Marble “BB Channel – Branch-Off Edition”, she throws the opponent into a melting pot of disorder. Although various things are being said, in short, it is a syringe attack from BB after she changes into a nurse’s clothing.

She is a little devil who, after she administered the Dark BB medicine to the opponent, would follow up (refill the syringe) by thoroughly getting the opponent’s NP resource, before scattering the resource onto her party.
