### Ten Crowns: EX→D

A transcendental Skill on the Authority-class. It has been said that the Ten Crowns indicate the ten evil rulers and the Seven Hills indicate the abominable city of evil. If one simply observes it, it is a Skill that makes all received injuries, occurred events, and any and every result into “something that did not happen.” In reality, BB is invincible as long as she is equipped with this.

“Heeey, even though that was said, that was from a tale of before. Look, if you assess this from the outset, something like an invincible cheat is disgraceful for me, right? So this is an unnecessary Skill for the awfully PRETTY and cute BB-chan that you have now☆

Ah, but using it if it’s for at least something small should also be OK, alright? Looook, just like this! Since she loves everyone, the wicked and cute BB-chan… has arrived!”

### Aurea Poculum: Golden Grail: EX→C

Aurea Poculum (Golden Cup). A road that leads to a Beast. The Golden Grail that BB possesses. It is also a Holy Grail. A negative Holy Grail that grants its possessor their impudent and egotistical desires. The cup that has been held by the Whore of Babylon, who appears in the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. It is a fake Holy Grail, but it is surely because it is a fake Holy Grail that it has become a “genuine” Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans without a regard to what is right and wrong. Concerning the Christians who regarded honourable poverty as a virtue in those days, this grail, which was formed as a symbol of riches such as gold, was surely to them the connotation of corrupted wealth and greed, as well as the vanity that one decides to adorn themselves in. Although it was clear at that point in time that it is called a cup held by the Whore of Babylon, who is the personification of the Roman Empire, this grail symbolizes the riches of the world, which inverted the words of Christ of “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth.”

“Now, it’s such a trivial story since it doesn’t even have annny sort of relation to me, so… it’s throoown away into the trash can! A mass of magical energy that grants my cravings, a golden honey that dyes anything and everything in my colour… please think of those as this Skill.

… Well, even though overusing this won’t even cast away my boss status, but that being the case, I’ll just restrain myself a little this time, ok? Well then, I wooonder if all the bad children had finished repenting? No? Okaaay, everyone will become PIGS~~♥”

### Self-Modification: EX

A Skill to remodel oneself.

The AIs made by the Moon Cell are furnished with an absolute order of “one must not improve their own functions.” But BB, who escaped that constraint because of her breakdown, began to expand her own functions. In order to enhance her calculation faculties, she predated/dismantled NPCs, AIs, and even Servants on top of that with black noises to utilize them as her own memory. A retrofit addition that does not spare herself from breaking down, but as a result, BB has been improved into a hyper grade AI that possesses an enormous capacity. These circumstances are similar to a city on reclaimed land that continues to construct buildings even while it is submerging, or maybe even Frankenstein’s monster as well.

### Potnia Theron: Womb of All Animals: EX

Potnia Theron (Animal Mistress). It is the Authority of the goddesses whom BB compiled and absorbed from the abyss of the Moon Cell. It is the embodiment of the power to create all things that the Mother Goddesses possess, originating approximately 8000 years ago from a goddess who already lost her name (the goddess of Çatalhöyük), and branching to Tiamat, Cybele, Ishtar, Inanna, Anat, Astarte, Gaia, Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite, Demeter, Athena, and so forth. Many of these goddesses have been pictured with an appearance that has a mural crown on them. That is because many of these goddesses were also simultaneously the guardian deities of cities.

This Authority is symbolized by things like the gates that opened in the earth and the sky (the caves and the moon), the whirlpools and waterspouts of the sea, and the craters of volcanoes, and from these, it gives birth to evil influences that bring about every sort of death. However, after these evils have finished spreading death, it promises a definite good harvest and fecundity. This Authority is none other than the power to bring death at the same time as creating life. The Earth Mother Goddesses are guardian deities that were worshipped by the people and blesses them with their divine protection, and at the same time, they are also the very sacrifices that feed the people with the grain and crops as well as with the beasts of the plains and forests that were brought into existence from their bodies. The Earth Mother Goddesses nourish humans with their own flesh and blood, and when time goes by, they kill those humans for their own nourishment in order to restore their flesh and blood, before they once again feed humans with the restored flesh and blood. This process is the very circle of the food chain too, and one could surely say that this cycle of life and death is the true nature of the Earth Mother Goddesses. With this Authority, nearly all these goddesses either gave birth to countless monsters and giants and became a threat to the gods and mankind, or they birthed heroes and protected the people after that. On the topic of threats, Tiamat and Gaia are examples of that, while on the topic of mothers of heroes, Hera is an example of that.

Those born on this earth cannot go against the Authority of the Mother Goddess. That is because it would mean rebelling against the system of life itself. However, it is surely when one has separated from the earth, aims to venture into outer space, and has finished their childhood as an intelligent lifeform that they would break free from this Authority. The wish of Çatalhöyük is for when that day has arrived.
