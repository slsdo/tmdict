### Personality

A bright and friendly figure.
Due to being a ruffian, he is rebellious against the powers that be; but in regards to the Master he would attend to him/her in complete sincerity.

However, should the Master be someone excessively violent in attitude, he would probably either go away or otherwise attempt to break and train{{n1}} them into a good lord.

### Attitude towards Master

He is fundamentally sincere, handling the Master like a teacher would.
Ever bright and proficient in artistic skills, should the Master request of it he would probably play an instrument and so forth.
However, his true nature is the outlaw who stretched all the way to Liang Shan Bo, a man who pursues freedom.

### Dialogue Examples

“Alrighty then, maybe I should gallantly do some fisticuffs!”
“Now that you’ve employed me this much, I suppose there’s not much else to do. Let me show that a ruffian that I am can get determined as well.”
“Master. Why would you trust me this much, even when I have yet to reveal my true name? You’re a softhearted one, huh… Well, even a ruffian got one or two things he can be proud of. As one of the 36 stars shining on heaven, I shall serve you with all my sincerity.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A fictitious fine fellow who appears in the “Shui Hu Zhuan”. While he had been an orphan from the beginning, he was picked up and raised by the wealthy Lu Junyì.
It had seem that the Lu Junyi’s love towards him was out of ordinary, that a theory had said that Lu Junyi had love Yan Qing no less than he had his wife.
Yan Qing, who had grown into a fairskinned and graceful young man of small stature, together entered the Liang Shan Bo, displaying great efforts no less than his lord.
The Liang Shan Bo before long became the representation of the loyalist army and went impoverished. Due to that, Yan Qing, afraid of being thrown away due to having served his purpose, encouraged Lu Junyi to escape together with him. But Li Junyi, who had been scheduled to receive an award, paid him no mind.
The weeping Yan Qing then escaped Liang Shan Bo alone, his whereabouts afterwards unknown.
In Shui Hu Zhuan, he was one of the few survivors. However, surely enough, none knew whether or not that is what he had wished for.

In the case of being summoned in another class, he would also uses crossbow and so forth.

### Connections with Characters

#### Li Shuwen

To think I would be able to fight a quan fa jia who had carved his name into historical fact. Dear me, I suppose this is what it means to become a Servant!

#### Jing Ke

I’m not being sexist or anything here; it’s just really surprising is all.
I mean, this here is the inspiration for the idiom “as if no one is watching”{{n2}}, you know?
…Although, if we get around to drink together, I’d probably immediately get how it is!

#### Quetzalcoatl

I’m fine with exchanging promise for a rematch and all, but really, I just can’t estimate a winning move.
…If it’s like this, I guess there’s nothing to it but to spend all time training and fumble for a strategy…

#### Marta (Swimsuit)

Since we’ve been getting more and more Servants who uses bare hands, I guess we really should hold a grand tournament here?
Is what I’d like to try suggest.
