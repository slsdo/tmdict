“Anyway, you just go and draw a handsome one” said the manager. So I did, in my own special way. At first, I had thought to make the design a seriously simple one, but with everything kinda out of order, when I realized it, during the design process this character ended up having the most component and details on him (sweat). His gauntlets and clothing also have immense amount of details, but beyond even that are his tattooes; it was seriously hard. That being said, I feel like the design ends up much better compared to my first image of him, and due to that right now I feel like those hardships are worth it. Oh, by the way, the character on his back is “義”{{n1}}; I inspected various things in regards to the Assassin of Shinjuku (Yan Qing), and it is the most suited to represent him. (Shimaudon)

1. {{note1}} 義 is justice, honor, righteousness, that sort of stuffs.
