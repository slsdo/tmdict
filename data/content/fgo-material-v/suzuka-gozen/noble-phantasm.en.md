Renai Happa - Tenkiame

It’s proper name is “Wisdom Sword of Manjushri - Daitouren”{{n1}}.

Using Supernatural Power, she splits her favorite sword - Daitouren - into a maximum of 250 copies then mercilessly rains them down on her enemies.

It was said that during her lifetime she once did 500 copies in a combo attack between Daitouren and Sohayamaru, its couple sword wielded by her husband.

This time, she mirrors Sohayamaru with her ornate hairpin filled with memories and activate Tenkiame by touching the floating Daitouren in the air.

Actually, it is not necessary to say the chant to activate the Noble Phantasm, it was all because of Suzuka’s mood.

Also, while normally she can only fire the sword copies with rough accuracy, with the use of “Blessing of Wisdom”, it is possible to make it so that “It will hit the surroundings but always avoid hitting Suzuka herself”.

A Noble Phantasm that can massively increase INT by using Shoutouren{{n2}}, the sword said to have been forged by the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.

Her swordsmanship becomes precise and her tactics improved. It also has merits such as improving the performance of “Tenkiame” or allowing “Trichiliocosm” to be used, but because she has to think more than necessary, she ends up in a temporary state of self-loathing by looking back at the inefficient lifestyle of a high school girl.

It’s actually not that she’s lamenting the inefficiency, she just unconsciously calculated the benefits. So while she is proud of high school girl lifestyle she is disappointed with herself when calculating the losses. Therefore Suzuka Gozen does not proactively use this.

### Trichiliocosm

By revealing Kenmyouren to the morning sun, it is possible to create the trichiliocosm…that means all kind of worlds and parallel worlds…within the blade, allowing her to survey them.

This is truly the case of one turning herself into the Moon Cell with just a blade.

Future calculation became possible and she can reach the most optimal answer by selecting and checking all possibilities of herself. It cannot be used unless she is under the effect of Blessing of Wisdom.

Since this skill is close to an Authority, as time goes on while she use it, she will slowly return to her original form (the form of a shrine maiden wearing a tate-eboshi{{n3}}), turn back the attributes, eventually unable to exist as a Servant and disappear.

…By the time she reached the form with the eboshi which is normally removed due to fashion reason and returned as close to her original attributes as possible, that’s when she cannot exist as a Servant.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Manjushri is the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, the oldest Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism. He always wield the Wisdom Sword which cuts down ignorance and duality. The sword is called Daitouren but she called it Daishintou during her NP chant. Sohayamaru is the sword wield by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, Suzuka’s husband, said to be created as the couple sword to Daitouren.
2. {{note2}} Daitouren and Shoutouren are both divine swords belong to Manjushri Bodhisattva. This goes with how Suzuka needs to have Blessing of Wisdom to maximize the power of Tenkiame, by using both swords of Manjushri.
3. {{note3}} The eboshi is the black hat you see her wearing in her 2nd ascension form.
