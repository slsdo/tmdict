### Riding: B

Talent for riding. She can ride most mounts better than the average person, but can’t mount Demon Beasts, Holy Beasts or other beasts of the same rank.
Her specialty are chariots, but they make her butt hurt, so she avoids it as she can.

### Territory Creation: A+

As a magician, she can construct a territory beneficial to her.
This time, she got it on an extraordinary rank due to the stories of making the theater and her good administration of the Colosseum.

### Item Creation (Unconventional): EX

Talent to make a variety of tools. There is nothing the self-proclaimed, almighty genius Emperor Nero can’t make.
Since her aesthetic sense doesn’t match the ordinary people’s tastes, all tools she creates can only be qualified as EX (non-standard/unquantifiable).
