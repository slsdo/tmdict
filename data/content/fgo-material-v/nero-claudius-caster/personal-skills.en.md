### Reckless Driver Privilege: EX

A Skill modified from Imperial Privilege.
Comes from the stories of her once running her chariot out of control in Olympia. You could say it’s learned from personal experience.
It’s a Skill that promises her first place no matter what happens. Even if she falls from her horse in the middle of the race, some Deus Ex Machina will make her first place in the end.

### Dreams to the Summer: A

Beach Flower: Nero edition.
While she shows off her beauty, this beauty is for all of those who smile at the beach.
But…
(However, this Skill was lost)

### Seven Crowns: C

Her fragrance thickens her sword and sharpens her armor.
Her state becomes ambiguous and the disadvantages brought by her class lose their meanings.
The ???? comes out of the sea.
Behold, the seven necks smoldering in the roaring sea.
Earth’s amassers of fortune, it is time to pour your desire into the golden goblet.

### The Undying Magus: A

Magecraft taught to her by her once magus mentor, Simon Magus.
Simon sentenced himself to decapitation, then revived.
It’s said that, due to her special mana, Nero as a magician can grant one-time immortality to a person and grant them physical strength like that of a beast.
