Itâ€™s your emperor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Her mystic weaponry is huge, putting an awesome pressure on the screen. YES!!!!! I wanted to make the character fill as much space as possible------!!! I feel like doing things this way leaves me a little happier when I ascend them------!!! I like the final ascension, because the colors compliment the composition quite well and it was very fun to draw. (Wada Arco)
