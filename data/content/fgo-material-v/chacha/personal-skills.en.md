### Golden Rule (Calamity): B

It is possible to freely use all the gold of the governors that were said to have gathered all the gold of Japan.
A skill with good compatibility with a genuine spendthrift like Chacha.
『Eh? Money? Your Highness will pay!』

### Innocent Monster (Blaze): C

The brand she carries as the matchless fiendish woman who left her name in history for having ruined Toyotomi’s life.
Actually, complex factors overlapped and destroyed him, it’s not only Chacha’s fault, but the masses always seek objects of blame that are easy to understand.
『Meh, false accusations!』

### Favored Princess of Japan: EX
A curse that continues gradually lowering the status of the target.
She who once made the Sun fall, regardless of her intentions, will ruin those related to her.
『If you fall in love with Chacha you’ll get burned! For real.』
