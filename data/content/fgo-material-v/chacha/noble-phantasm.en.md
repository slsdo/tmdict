Kenran Makai Nichirinjō.
The ruin of what once was the 『Castle of the Sun』, the symbol of the Child of the Sun, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. A burning Ōsaka castle materializes, the dead of those related to Toyotomi appear from the ground to rush on the enemy, and the surroundings are burned down by crimson flames. A manifestation of the ruin that eventually burned down everything including herself, the remains of a fallen sun.
A Noble Phantasm that embodies the last moments of Chacha, the woman who destroyed Toyotomi, a cursed siren{{n1}} beauty, the princess of blazing hell.

Is it similar to the final Noble Phantasm of Nobunaga because of the blood of the Demon King flowing through her body?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Interesting fact: the kanjis used here are 傾国, which are also used in 傾国傾城, a “woman so glamorous as to bring ruin to a country (castle) as its king (lord) is captivated by her beauty” (copy-pasted from jisho).
