Cross-Calibur.
Through a spontaneous explosion of the mana converter Altereactor, a torrent of mana overflowing and breaking through the critical point annihilates the enemy Saber.
Although it’s an internalization of Heroin X’s 『Unsigned Sword of Victory』, there doesn’t exist a sword it belongs to. In that case, a guu-pan (this) would do as a Noble Phantasm as well.
However, as her nemesis Heroin X isn’t covered by the special feature of Sabers, it’s a sadly different Noble Phantasm.
