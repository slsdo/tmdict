As a Berserker version of Mysterious Heroine X, initially I thought she’d be a Berserker version of a woman that will absolutely kill Sabers from another side but after several exchanges, a Berserker from an unusual literature was born. What do I mean? There aren’t many tsukkomis but when angered please take something sweet, have a cup of tea and calm down. (BUNBUN)
