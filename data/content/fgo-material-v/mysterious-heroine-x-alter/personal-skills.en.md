### ∞ Black Bean Paste: EX

A mysterious item in which the six primitive powers 『Desire (soul), Sugar content (power), Sales location (space), Cost price (reality), Production (time), Demand (mind)』 have been kneaded.
It grants infinity power to the one who has it, as to turn half of the universe into a confectionery factory with one fingertip, but it seems she doesn’t know it well.
Old name: 『∞ Chocolate』.
(“Tohsaka, I don’t feel so good”).

### Instinct: C → Instantaneous Shadowless Sword: C+

Although it seems she idles her time away every day, in truth she was quietly getting deeper in the thoughts that lead to the meaning of enlightenment.
……It’d be nice if that was like that, her insatiable and lazy mind that vaguely seeks a wish, has further refined and pushed her sword technique to the extreme.
(So she can sword good because she’s too lazy? I guess it’s something like “let’s finish quick so I can go home”).

### Invisible Hand of the King: C

Dark teachings about how to be an emperor taught by the teacher Master Agravain.
While reading the flow of battle, controlling equals from the shadows, the essence is in various wiles trying to bring out their capabilities to the utmost.
(If I understand it correctly, it’s something like Charisma but a la “mysterious super-villain whose face is shadowed until he decides to fight the main characters personally”).
