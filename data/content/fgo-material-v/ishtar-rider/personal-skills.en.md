### Goddess’ Divine Core: B

The Skill that shows she is a perfect goddess from birth.
It has an effect that preserves the absoluteness of her body and mind. Mental interventions are mostly mitigated, her body never ages, her figure doesn’t change no matter how many calories she intakes.
It’s a composite Skill including Divinity.
Due to her being a Pseudo-Servant, its rank stops at B.
(Passive Skill)

### Shining Dress of Water: A

The Skill of the Great Crown converted into a swimsuit.
It buffs the party’s Buster and Quick, and on top of that, raises their NP efficiency.
The Great Crown is exclusively for Ishtar’s personal use, but this version is spread through everyone in the party. In exchange, its output is lower.

### Accel Turn: B

An emergency dodge with the Maanna Scooter.
The now smaller Maanna seems better at making tight turns, making it possible for it to perform instant dodges.
Her gorgeous and graceful evading of her pursuers’ attacks is like that of a Hollywood movie heroine.

### Summer Breaker!: A

The goddess who (in many senses) destroys the summer.
She temporarily unleashes her Saint Graph as a goddess and wreaks havoc with it.
A watered-down version of the Goddess Metamorphosis Skill that Tamamo no Mae and Kiara have.
