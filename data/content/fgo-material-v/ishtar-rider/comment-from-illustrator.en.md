Since this is Ishtar’s Rider version, I wanted to include some Rider aspects in the drawing, so I had various different ideas, like for example, “she’s Rider because she rides on top of a magic circle”. Then I had just as many ideas thinking of dresses and yukatas for when she uses her Noble Phantasm. It was a very fun experience. (Morii Shizuki)
