Since sheâ€™s wearing a more modern outfit, her Noble Phantasm converts accordingly to a more modern True Name.
Her style is to enjoy summer to the max.
It is a rainbow Noble Phantasm where she rides the Maanna Scooter, has a wonderful time visiting multiple resorts around the world, and converts this happy feelings into mana to pour it down across the land.
Changed into a beautiful costume, she turns the mana she keeps raining on the ground into shining stars and inflicts damage to her enemies.
Ishtar herself is feeling totally happy and fabulous about it, but the people in the land are not too pleased about her antics.
