### Riding: EX

As someone who can skillfully pilot Maanna the Boat of Heaven, Ishtar’s Riding Skill is exceptional, on a different dimension from humans.
Of course, “exceptional” doesn’t necessarily means “better” or “faster” than humans. Anyways, she is “all sorts of impressive”.
Uruk Driving cares little for minor obstacles like time or space.

### Independent Action: A

The ability to operate independently for a while even if she is disconnected from the Master’s mana supply.
Combined with the fact she’s a Pseudo-Servant, this means she is pretty much free to act independently in the present world.
Staying away from Chaldea from approximately 2 whole weeks to secretly plan and set up her goddess worshipping Event was probably not even difficult for her.{{n1}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Since the info here contradicts the info on [Archer’s mats](https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/6951-Fate-Grand-Order-Mats?p=2796416&viewfull=1#post2796416), I felt the need to vouch that I double-checked everything and neither translation is faulty. The inconsistency is entirely on Type-Moon and it’s also present in the Japanese text.
