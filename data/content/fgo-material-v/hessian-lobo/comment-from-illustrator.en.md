I drew the gigantified wolf swelling up by the power of hatred with a flaring and strongly boiling image. The shackles are as if embodying him never ever forgetting his grudges. The Hessian is famous in Sleepy Hollowâ€¦ so much so that I had to really think what to make of him, but then I had him with a military uniform that does not really look out of place and a gigantic sword scythe in hand. If I may say so myself, he sure ends up looking like a character from a different game! (Shimokoshi)
