### Avenger: A

NP rate of increase raises by means of taken damage. Grudges and resentments accumulates easily.
Come what may, still humans shall be annihilated.

### Memory Correction: B

That hatred shall never, ever be forgotten.
Like a small, unsightly scar carved unto the history of man, it shall remain for eternity.

### Self-Recovery (Magic Energy): B

For as long as he exist in the world made by humans, he shall continue to devour his feed with hatred as his fang.

### Transparency: D-

This is not the concealment of presence, but physically turning human body transparent through drug administration.
Even if one perceives “whether or not he is nearby” from the level of Hessian Lobo’s force of existence, one would still be unable to tangibly read his coordinates; a rare case where such low rank of the skill conversely becomes a merit instead.
It amplifies ferocity as a compensation, but… it entirely has no effect on Hessian Lobo.
