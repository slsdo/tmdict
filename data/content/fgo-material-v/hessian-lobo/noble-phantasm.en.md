Frieren Scharfrichter.
The execution of rage, taking form out of their desire for revenge.
Although it does not possess the ability in the level of reversing cause and effect, by means of subtly adding a deviation towards the world within the range of the Noble Phantasm, it creates a situation where “beheading becomes easy”.
A severing-and-killing Noble Phantasm which decapitates in one blow.
