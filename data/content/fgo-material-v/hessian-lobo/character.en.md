### Personality

One had had his wife murdered by humans, whereas the other had been beheaded by a surprise attack. While those are their origin, this composite Servants have the wolf king as the main lynchpin, while Hessian simply obeys silently.

The saint graph numerical value is unable to establish whether or not the invisible man is self aware.
The meaning of his wordless silence can be taken to be similar as that of a Berserker; however, he is highly intelligent.
Nonetheless, said intelligence is for the sake of hunting down humans.

### Attitude towards Master

On the case of being summoned, they will wordlessly accompany the Master. Exceedingly fastidious, Lobo in particular is unable to simply open up his heart.
Such a way being is less of that of an antihero and more of that of an avenger.
Nevertheless, there is no other way but to keep on connecting with them in patience and perseverance.
Upon being disgruntled, they will turn transparent and run away.

### Dialogue Examples

None.

### Historical Image · Character Image

Hessian holds the nuance of the “German mercenary”, but strictly speaking it is not a name.
This nameless mercenary had crossed to America only to be killed and lost his head. The revived mercenary wished for the return of his head, as he prowled about in the woods of New York.

On the other hand, the Wolf King Lobo who had made an appearance in Setton’s “Wild Animals I Have Known” was the name of a wolf who (was reported to) have been actually alive.
Lobom who had continuously hunted down the cow lifestocks, possessed strength that even feared by the shepherds as the “devil”. Setton had been invited and had managed to apprehend his wife, the white wolf Blanca; by using her corpse as a lure, Lobo had finally been captured.
It is said that the Wolf King Lobo had not even a single meal after his capture, simply dying while looking towards the distant.

Jack Griffin was a scientist who ends up turning himself invisible; he is an existence close to a conceptual formalwear which had ended up extracting only the component of “transparency”, and he does not come out to the outside.

Although each of their bearings are different, they all equally embrace the desire for revenge against humans; wishing not of punishment through justice (Avenger) but simply revenge through hatred.

### General Armaments

A falciform blade reminiscent of Harpe
Fang bites
One Shrouded in Death (armor)

### Connections with Characters

*with the exception of 1 part, these are not from the perspective of Hessian Lobo but of the other Servants.

#### Edmond Dantes

As a fellow avenger, he embraces a sense of duty out of a kind of compassion towards their revenge.

#### Knight Servants

There are those who shows pity, and there are those who shows respect towards Hessian, who had continued on fighting despite having lost his head. Reactions vary.

#### Nursery Rhyme / Enkidu / Mecha Eli-chan / Mecha Eli-chan II

Fundamentally speaking, Lobo is cautious towards all human Servants (and even towards divine spirits who are subjects of faith), but as an exception, towards “those perfectly inhuman” he slightly loosens down his guard.
However, because he is cautious against oni kin in a different way, he treats Ibaraki Douji and Shuten Douji no different than the others.

Jack the Ripper and Jeanne d’Arc Alter Santa Lily are a bit unhappy due to him allowing only Nursery Rhyme to get close and that’s just unfaiiiir.
