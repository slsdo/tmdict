### Nyarf! B:

NYARF, a super water gun apparently made by Edison that can be freely manipulated.
By the existence of this skill, Helena’s Saint Graph was apparently defined as an Archer.

### Colonel’s Summer Holiday B:

The Olcott dolls will serve Helena even if in summer holidays.
For her who has become rather more active than usual, they’ll do their utmost to entertain her. The joy of summer holidays for them, Helena’s satisfaction, lies on that one point.
