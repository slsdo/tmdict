### Personality

Her first premise to participate in the race is 『Let’s have fun!』.
Of course, since there’s nothing better than winning…… In a setting where she’s likely to win she’ll aim for a brilliant victory, that’s her policy.
But after all, she’s practically the same Helena that can’t be proactive.

### Attitude towards Master

Doesn’t change much from usual.
But, when she lets her mind wander her granny side comes out.

### Dialogue Examples

『Helena Blavatsky, has brilliantly tried to change her Saint Graph! I can do it well if I try!』
『…… Perhaps, there’s a proper reason. This isn’t actually that easy to do.』
『Now that I can, I must have fun!』
『Nyarf! Fufu, this water gun is lots of fun! Very well!』
『Mahatma Change! And from there! The third light!』

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A sudden clothing & class Mahatma Change!
With a new Noble Phantasm that borrows the power of the Demon Lord of Law Enforcement, the Kumara Wheel that she manifests for the race, Helena Blavatsky challenges the summer event!
With the cool water gun NYARF, she’ll eliminate the rivals lined up!
『By the way, NYARF’s production is mine!』
『I did the improvisations, you klutz!』

The same person as the Caster Helena Blavatsky.

For her who was about to explode for several things, Edison and Tesla thought that 『venting stress』 was mandatory.
For that reason, she participates in the race (2017 summer event).
For that reason, she does as she pleases.
Helena decided to accept their concerns.
That is ―― in order to vent stress, she’s going to enjoy her summer vacation to her heart’s content!

### Connections with Characters

#### Nikola Tesla / Edison

Now, let’s vent some stress!
Eh, what, Mister Edison? Nyarf? For me?
Hmm, but I don’t need a firearm, it’s dangerous…… Ah, a water gun? Very well, that’s fine!

#### Mysterious Heroine X

That’s a rocket……
You know, that thing Braun-kun from Germany aimed for. That thing to conquer the sea of stars, right?

#### #### Nitocris

Scarab––!
I like it! I like it, that thing. I want to ride it too!

#### Fran / Babbage / Moriarty

What’s that, it’s so cool! It looks incredibly fun!
Very well, we’ll make a special vehicle that is more fun and Mahatma-y!
Wait wait!

#### Ishtar

All told I had lots of fun. Fufu, thanks!

#### El-Melloi II

This time I want to hear about your disciples. I’m sure there were many funny children.
I must compete with Yeats-kun’s story.

#### Medea

I want to talk with you again. About things to study!

#### Holmes

…… Sigerson. You, you’ve angered me on purpose.
Don’t 『it’s good to relax from time to time』 me, geez!
But you’re right.
This isn’t so bad from time to time. Hmm, it was fun.
