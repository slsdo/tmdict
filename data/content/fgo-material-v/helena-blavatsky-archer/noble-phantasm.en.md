Sanat Kumara Wheel.
A new Noble Phantasm that Helena brought out with the class change.
A silver torus. It’s composed of the same material that the flying object that appears when releasing the Noble Phantasm’s True Name as a Caster, and has a different composition from any substance on Earth.
Countless flying objects appear with the True Name release, and pour beams over the surroundings like rain. Although a violent explosion occurs, they’ll never hit Helena directly.
