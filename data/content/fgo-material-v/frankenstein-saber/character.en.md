### Personality

Completely defeated by the summer heat, she’s sluggish, bothered, and exhausted.
A bit cooler with a swimsuit, at the same time she has the faint expectation of getting cooler by feeling the wind in the race.

### Attitude towards Master

Rolling while saying “hot”, she’s rather tempting.
Because it’s become easier for her to talk since the rank of Mad Enhancement has been lowered, she’s a bit happy to be able to interact with the Master.
That said, same as when she was a Berserker, a relation of『being able to understand each other through the eyes』is ideal.

### Dialogue Examples

『Uuuuhhh…………… Sluggish, tired, hot』
『Papa?』
『Simple』

### Historical Image · Character Image

Swimsuit Frankenstein, cute and looks like a large breed dog.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Since it’s summer, even the steadfast Fran is showing her Master a loose attitude.
She occupies Master’s bed when at a hot place, rolling while lazily and tiredly basking on the air conditioned.
Since she theoretically doesn’t have a trace of evil, seeing this Servant innocently wanting to occupy the bed makes you go 『Gnnn』.

### Character Concept

Swimsuit Fran-chan is cute!
Cute!
C-U-T-E!
That’s all.

Seriously speaking, Saber Fran who became bothersome because of the summer heat.
But she tends to go berserk sometimes, hahaha you’re in trouble either way hahaha.
The image is 『a large breed dog that is listless because of the summer heat』.

### General Armaments

#### Bridal Blade

『A bit heavy』A complex transformable energy blade that has been improved with evil remodels by two crazy inventors, upon hearing the laments of a young girl.
Thunder energy makes it transform as the girl wishes depending on the situation. It’s a weapon packed with the romance of young boys, but it isn’t that exciting for Fran.
Incidentally, the first victims apparently were the two that remodeled it as they wanted.

### Connections with Characters

#### Charles Babbage

A gentle yet strict parental figure.
Scolding her procrastination, he made sure she participated in the race. Nagging but she likes it.
By the way, can you transform into something?
Since it’s steam–.
I see.

#### Archer of Shinjuku

A grandpa that is sweet with his grandchildren, simple. But, although he looks sweet he may be about to conspire some crime without being noticed, a rotten evil boss.

#### Other swimsuit Servants

Everyone’s exposure is amazing–.
To get there, I think I’ll get tightly wrapped with bandages.
