The motif for Frankenstein’s ear parts is screws, because she’s Frankenstein’s monster. At the beginning, I though of attaching them to the temples but I’m glad to give it up. The third stage having bandages was inevitable too because she’s Frankenstein’s monster, so it’s unavoidable that her final Ascension art has an ecchi feeling. (Okazaki Takashi)
