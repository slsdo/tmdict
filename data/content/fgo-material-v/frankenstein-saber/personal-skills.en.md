### Summer Galvanism: B+

A somewhat different Galvanism for summer.
Specifically, by receiving backup from Babbage, a steam engine is also sending power.
Demerits: Hot, sluggish.

### Hollow Wailing towards the Intense Heat: A

Fran-chan’s a bit hot, very sluggish, tired, and sulky.
That form, is like a large dog that has been defeated by the summer heat.
My, how cute.

### Moderate-load: C

Since Overload is bothersome, she’s Moderate-loading.
