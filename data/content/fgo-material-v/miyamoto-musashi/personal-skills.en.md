### Heavenly Eyes: A

The Heavenly Eyes are said to be “the power to achieve one’s goal”.
Once one decides to achieve one thing, they devote themselves to it completely and always succeed. One could say they load their entire being into their line of sight and project it at their goal.
In Musashi’s case, her Heavenly Eyes aim only at “slicing off this part”.
For example, if she decided to “cut the opponent’s right arm”, she will take any means necessary to cut off the right arm.
It will become the most ideal slash for the situation, “a stroke with no wasted movement that bends time and space to its needs”.
From the targeted opponent’s perspective, the super genius has entered their zone as if she was locked on to them with a laser sight, causing them to think “This chick is aiming at my right arm like hell! She’s itching to cut it off! I know she’s going for it, but I won’t even bother blocking, because I can feel she’s gonna cut it off no matter what I try! HEEEEEEEEELLLLPPPPP!” Super scary.

It’s the power to make “the means necessary to accomplish one’s goal narrowed down to one single means”.
One could say they are extremely special Mystic Eyes that limit the infinite possibilities of the future into “one single” result. These eyes are also the reason why Musashi tends to drift away between parallel worlds.

### Voidless: A

{{n1}}
The highest rank a swordsman can attain. The ultimate mental state. Equivalent to the Yagyuu Shikage-ryuu’s Suigetsu.
Becoming voidless is, consequently, becoming invincible. Only a swordsman who has achieved mental Infinity can perceive voidlessness.
Not even a slash that uses the Multi-Dimensional Refraction Phenomenon can reach someone voidless.

### Fifth Seihou: A

{{n2}}
A stance that instantly maximizes on power, the main advantage of using two swords.
The Niten Ichi-ryuu is a style that fights while going along with the circumstances, letting the sword fight as it wants to, but in exceptional situations, when she is facing against a powerful opponent; when she is facing against destiny, she calms herself down, turns her sword’s heart into Zero, and takes the stance.

### Battle Continuation: EX

Tries every dirty trick in the book to survive. Playing dead not to lose a fight is one of her fortes.
She confuses the enemies with her speeches and pulls off amazing comebacks from disgraceful escapes.
She is a shameless realist to the core and seems to use “If I win at the end, I’m the winner, right? That’s why I have to run away now! After all, if I’m dead, I can’t win at the end, can I?” as a convenient excuse for it. This is who Girl Musashi is.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The Book of Five Rings defines “void” as “everything that can’t be seen or explained”, so being voidless would mean seeing and understanding everything.
2. {{note2}} Fate/ calls the stances by their numbers rather than their names (not an uncommon practice between instructors, actually), but the stance in question is called the Migi Waki Gamae. It’s the stance she does in her Skill activation animations.
