I always wanted to draw a katana character, but who would have thought it would be the great swordsmaster. I felt way too excited thinking about her contrasts with Kojirou. As the person who designed her, it’s not my place to say this, but I’m glad she turned out to be a cute and attractive character in more than just appearance. I’m very glad she turned out to be a character I want to stay with me forever. Including the Niou in her Noble Phantasm, this was a job where I had a lot I needed to design. (Koyama Hirokazu)
