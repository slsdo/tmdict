### Magic Resistance: A

Witchcraft, ninjutsu and evil spirits tempting the human realm are nothing to be afraid of.
A swordsman does not need to be a master to ward off, in a single stroke, techniques that do not have a swordâ€™s heart.
No matter the type of Greater Ritual, she can cut down any magecraft ranked A or lower.
