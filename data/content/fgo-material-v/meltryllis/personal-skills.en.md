### Crime Ballet: A

Merely a battle style.
A number of combat skills created as a result of Meltryllis, who adores classic ballet, retuning herself.
She came to possess diverse abilities by converting already perfected stories and settings into skills.
『The Name on the Heel is the Cursed Sword Giselle』『Unforgivable Hilarion』『Farewell Albrecht』『The Siren Who Burns Entrails』and so on.
Originally, Meltryllis is an Alter Ego created from BB’s “Altruism Desire” and “Pleasure”, its true nature being the figure of an abnormally lovely maiden who can’t help but stir up the desire in men to protect her―――――is how it used to be.
Although it appears her adoration for ballet is due to that image, perhaps due to the influence of the skill that continues to steal the opponent’s abilities, currently, her personality is quite belligerent.

### Sadistic Constitution: A

A Skill that provides a bonus correction to one’s aggression during battle.
It seems like a positive Skill, but the longer its possessor stays in combat, the more their abusive disposition will grow, causing them to lose their usual composure.
It could be called a skill that causes one to rampage just one step short of becoming a Berserker.
One becomes stronger the more they attack, but on the other hand, their defensive power drops.
Since it also has the negative aspect of unconsciously lowering the possibility that the possessor would withdraw, you could say that it has a bad compatibility with the usually composed Meltryllis.

### Melt Virus: EX

The special powers possessed by the Alter Egos since birth called id_es.
The cheat skill evolved from 『Absorption』.
The highest grade of energy drain.
It makes draining, copying and scaling down possible.
The process of draining is:

1. The virus produced inside Meltryllis’ body is injected into the target in the form of nectar (poison), melting the parameters stolen at that time, such as “experience points”, “skills” and “capacity”.
2. After that, she absorbs, converts and turns the parameters liquefied by her virus into a part of herself.

Something like that.
If it possesses a shape, organic matter, inorganic substance, no matter what it might be, she can drain it, but if it’s something shapeless…such things as a spiritual nature or skills, although they can be liquefied, converting them into “something of her own” is difficult so it seems like she can only use them as simple nutrients.
Due to this, “experience points” and “capacity” are the main things she can make “her own”.
In 『CCC』, she managed to pull off a drastic move where she scaled down humans and Servants, shrinking them to minimum size and she sent them into the enemy’s body as a virus.
In 『FateGO』, making no distinction between friend or foe, it has the effect of reducing (draining) the power of Noble Phantasms while increasing the power of her own.

### Saint Graph Expansion: B

A skill similar but dissimilar to “Shapeshift”.
Meltryllis’ essence is water, and if she felt like it, she could behave like a fluid.
The mythological essences who became her foundation…the god of rivers and civilization, Saraswati; the great tidal wave swallowing cities, Leviathan; these two grant her a perfectly slipstream-like constitution.
