Saraswati・Meltout.
Originally, it’s not an Anti-Mind, but an Anti-Populace, Anti-World Noble Phantasm.
Not meant for battle or against combatants, instead, it’s to be used against a civilization that has established a standardized culture.
Not just the body, Meltryllis’ nectar sweetly dissolves one’s mind too.
This Noble Phantasm melts the good sense and morals of the community, fusing them into a sort of colony.
Its original power is to trample and absorb the body, mind, and society that has been reduced to a slime-like state.
It displays an immense effect against non-combatants, revealing the malicious nature of Meltryllis and the others.
The one this Noble Phantasm’s made up of is the goddess Benzaiten, one of the Seven Gods of Fortune, one regarded as the same as the three Munakata goddesses and Ugajin.{{n2}}
It takes the form of Benzaiten’s biwa, controlling “things that flow” like natural phenomena, water, and wind, in particular, music and words, language and poetry.
Benzaiten’s origin is the river goddess from Hindu mythology, Saraswati.
She’s a cowardly goddess when it comes to love; she was born from the creator god Brahma, however, she had to run for her life when she was unable to endure Brahma’s passionate looks who, due to her overwhelming beauty, wished for her to become his spouse.
Saraswati is a goddess who governs arts and learning, and since being worshipped as Benzaiten, she gained the authority of increasing wealth too.

Virgin Laser・Palladion.
The combined Noble Phantasm of Passionlip and Meltryllis, modeled after the goddess Athena’s spear.
A super long-distance Noble Phantasm where Meltryllis - whose whole body’s been turned into a Noble Phantasm by transforming into a liquid state - is fired as a projectile, using the space compressing ability of Passionlip’s Trash & Crash as a shooting device (catapult).
Palladion is the statue of the goddess Athena who protected the fortress city, Troy, in Greek mythology.
As long as this statue was there, Troy was impregnable, however, due to the schemes of the enemy army, the statue was stolen and Troy fell.
Palladion, mighty without equal as “something that protects the city”, was, in fact, something that served to indicate the city’s fated destruction if it was to be lost.
