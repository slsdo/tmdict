### High Servant: A

Artificial Servant created by combining multiple mythological essences.
She possesses the components of Artemis, Leviathan and Saraswati.

### Riding: B

The ability to ride mounts.
As long as it is an animal that exists in reality, she can ride it, even if it is a wild one.

### Goddess’s Divine Core: B

A Skill representing one as a perfect goddess from birth.
It has the effect of preserving the absolute nature of one’s mind and body. Repels all forms of mental interference, prevents the body’s growth and maintains one’s figure no matter how much calories are ingested.

### Magic Resistance: B

Invalidates spells with a chant below three verses.
Even if one is targeted by High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals, it is difficult for them to be wounded.

### Independent Action: A

The ability to act independently for a while even if the supply of mana from the Master is rejected.
An Alter Ego which exists as 『another aspect of an existence』 can act alone even without a Master. Meltryllis is more geared towards Independent Action, but this seems to be due to her heart which finds “an étoile (star) shining on the stage all by herself” beautiful.
