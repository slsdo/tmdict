### Personality

Belligerent and ruthless. Moreover, a queen-like personality with sadistic tastes.
A fondness for structural beauty, and a fastidiousness that won’t forgive unsightly things.
Since she is a flawless existence, her pride is high, self-confident that she can do everything by herself.

An ego created from BB’s “Altruism Desire” and “Pleasure”.
Scorning humans, pessimistic about things, finding everything boring, she possesses a glum outlook like this, however, that is the opposite of her wish of “wanting to see beautiful things”.
Since Meltryllis is an Alter Ego born from the “wish of a maiden”, her foundation is the same as Passionlip’s, wishing for a Prince Charming to come for her.
She is cold-hearted, but this is due to a thoughtful rationality,
She is merciless, but this is due to her ascertaining everything fairly,
She has sadistic tastes, but this is because she possesses the virtue of taking care of those she likes by earnestly meddling with them.
Since she is fully aware of being a monster, she does not believe she can come to a mutual understanding with humans.
She does not believe in that and behaves like a monster, but if she were to fall in love with somebody, with no concern for the fact that she is a monster, she will offer her services to them; a primadonna who lives for love.

Despite absorbing others, she does not wish for understanding and sympathy, after all, to Meltryllis, the feelings of others is something she does not understand.
To her, other people are unneeded. Loves and dreams can not coexist. In case such a girl were to possess love, she would offer everything up along with her services to the object of her love for sure.
To the self-sufficient Meltryllis, there is no merit in taking the feelings of the other party into consideration.
She declares her love as just with a high-handed attitude.
She has no intention to discuss,
　　　　　　(she loves you so much that she no longer feels the need for something like that)
She has no desire to touch each other,
　　　　　　　　　　(she is no longer satisfied with pleasure of such magnitude)
She does not feel like informing you of her wish to be loved.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Such mutual understanding is no longer necessary)

Truly a domineering ego with all sorts of no’s.
Behind that always condescending, high-handed attitude, there’s a resolute, unclouded and overly pure love.

After the events of 『CCC』, Meltryllis realized it.
The incarnation of “self pleasure” that does not need others; the true foundation of such a self.
What lied at Meltryllis’ core was none other than the “devotion to her loved one”.

…Raising her levels with repeated drains, trying to control the Moon Cell, these are all offerings for her lover’s supreme pleasure.
Protect lover -> Absorb him -> The absorbed him (even if he will change so much that he can’t even comprehend) will live on forever.
She decided that this is the most supreme love that she can offer to her lover.
Seen from such a Meltryllis point of view, even BB and Lip are no more than “Impurities who think they want to be saved too”.
…However, that thought is way too dismissive.
For her, who only finds her own heart trustworthy and has a weak connection to the outside world, the act of “falling in love with another person” itself was a fatal defect (bug).

This became the cause of Meltryllis’ defeat, but the current her acknowledges this defect.
Her perfect self degraded to something imperfect.
Meltryllis is already aware that’s a “dream” she, herself, has given birth to.

### Attitude towards Master

Although she revised her way of thinking, after the events of 『CCC』, Meltryllis’ misanthropy remained the same as ever.
She’ll lend her power to the Master that made a contract with her, but - “To think I would serve something like a human!” - she’ll complain incessantly like so.
Nonetheless, after deepening their bonds, - “…Well, you’re better than other humans, you know.” - she’ll open her heart…maybe.

### Dialogue Examples

「I only saved you on a whim. I see. You, you don’t have a Servant, do you. Perfect. Wonderful.
I too was searching for a convenient doll (master).」
「I’ll save you from that woman. In exchange, form a contract with me. No, you must form one with me. After all, if you don’t, you’ll be dying here.
――――Look. There is no time. I won’t say it again so listen close.
I am the Alter Ego of Pleasure, Meltryllis. Since I feel like it, I’ll become your sword. Therefore――――」
「Nod (answer) like the slave you are, would you? You are my Master, after all.」
「Alter Egos were created in order to deny humanity. We are supposed to be your natural enemies, you see.
The hunters, us, and the hunted, you. It’s just a one-sided relationship like that.」
「You are also an obstinate human, aren’t you. Are you not afraid of me? Spiked feet with heels made of blades and poison that melts all that it touches. Other than my suppressive power as a weapon, there is nothing else you want from me, no?」
「I am just an Alter Ego for him/her.
That’s fine. That is fine. After all, originally, we were beings who have never met.」
「I did not fight because I wanted to love.
――――I flew away from the lake so I could fall in love.」

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The Alter Ego of Pleasure.
The familiars created by BB by removing her personality (emotions).
Since they are not “copies of her personality”, but were “created from the foundation of her personality”, instead of avatars they became alter egos (different personalities). With her drain function, a top class synthesizing ability even among the Alter Egos BB produced, Melt surpassed even her creator (BB).
Possessing the nature of a liquid, she’s the perfect fluid concealing the possibility to become the very ocean itself as she develops within herself.
…However, somehow she ended up adoring classical ballet, and started fussing about having human limbs. Because she is aware of being a perfected individual, she has an enormous amount of pride, and she’s also aggressive to boot.
“My constitution is as sadistic as I thought.
Being able to thoroughly kick the hated enemies to death is honestly out of this world.”
Meltryllis is exactly like a Queen of Water, however, her body can not deviate from the figure of a young girl which is more delicate and pitiful than any other Ego’s.

### Neurological Disorder

The outside world is perceived with the five senses――――the five sensors of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch, and with these echoes, one can also perceive their own self.
In general, humans come in contact with the world via their passive sensitivity.
Using the outstanding sensors called the five senses subconsciously, they receive things every day.
However, if any of the five senses’ ability deteriorates, the consciousness must aggressively face the world. What was passive becomes active.
For example, those who lost the light of their eyes specialize the remaining four and use them as even greater sensors. Ironically, they will function several times sharper than the senses of the human who still have all five.
Among Meltryllis’ five senses, her sense of touch has deteriorated.
Especially the sensation of her hands――――of her fingertips is almost completely lost. Due to this, her connection to the outside world has turned aggressive.
It seems like even her sadistic constitution, when you get right down to it is, is the result of “because she alone can not sense others’ existence”.
Incidentally, this is the reason she has clumsy fingers and why she can’t immerse herself in her hobby of making dolls, assembling them out of garage kits. Now hiring skilled builders!

### Connections with Characters

#### BB

It’s not like I have a hard time dealing with her, but I don’t like her either, the Original. She displays an unbelievably disgraceful behavior from time to time, giving even me a headache during those times.
Since it’s obvious that she’ll become a hindrance eventually, if I have an opportunity and a motive, I’d like to stab her in the back, you see?

#### Passionlip

Didn’t she become better than before?
She was the most childish one among us, but that part of her also left her ample room to mature.
However, even if it’s me, I can’t cover for her when it comes to those hands.

#### Sesshouin Kiara

Greed and vitiation, in this manner, she is the personification of a pure “woman”.
My love was for my own satisfaction too, but it’s my loss when it comes to that woman.
Actually, I don’t want to be put in the same category as her!

#### Tristan

The perfect example for a man who can be considered attractive if he just keeps quiet and we’re only talking about his appearance.
…Well, the contents are relatively attractive too, but…why is it that he becomes so deplorable when he starts talking, I wonder…

#### Artemis

It’s strange… Cold like ice and an efficiently stream-lined body shape; that’s the feeling one should get when speaking of Artemis…
Is that, by any chance, an Avatar?

#### Osakabehime

I sympathize with her. As a collector who does not create.
Should I steal a glance at her net purchase history next time, I wonder…

#### Emiya

When I see that face, I get irritated for some reason. Awfully irritated!
