### The Fool’s Way of Using a Sword: A

Carrying out battles with inconceivably foolish ideas. Ding-dong dashing Buddhist temples, setting up firecrackers in teakettles and making Nobukatsu cry, she acts as she pleases. Since these sort of things are all she cared about in the first place, her close combat skills are powered up in the worst way possible.

### Atsumori Beat: B

A way of using the sword that involves dancing and brings certain death, letting the beat of Atsumori resound through the battlefield. While it would be great if she made it clear whether it’s a dance or song, according to Nobu, this is Rock. A superb skill that does not feel like it would bring amazing effects upon use despite seeming like that at first glance, but when used regularly it turns out to be powerful after all.

### Demon King of the Sixth Heaven from the Beach: A{{n1}}

The monster who distorted her own existence according to her image of Summer. Her abilities and appearance ended up changing. A different version of her original “Demon King” skill. This is how it ended up when the Demon King changed into a swimsuit at the beach. It also feels like her chest became a bit bigger as a side effect.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The literal translation is “Demon King of the Sixth Heaven of the Beach” or “The Beach’s Demon King of the Sixth Heaven”, but these sounded weird to me so I went with the above version.
