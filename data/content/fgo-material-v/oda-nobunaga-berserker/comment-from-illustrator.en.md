An “I wish she’d calm down a little”-type Servant. However, she can not calm down. That is fine. She’ll burn everything while laughing. Her skills being plain and simple are really helpful so once you get used to using her, she is a Servant you simply can’t replace… Ah… The NP gauge is not enough for the third wave… (pako)
