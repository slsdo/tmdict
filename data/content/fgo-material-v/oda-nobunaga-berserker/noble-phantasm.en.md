Nobunaga THE Rock ’n’ Roll.
The true Noble Phantasm of Demon King Nobunaga who destroys gods and Buddha…well, the slightly altered version of that.
The limited release of her Reality Marble reborn as a being that displays immense might against those that possess divinity or mystery.
Visually, a mysterious giant skeleton manifests behind Nobu’s back, displaying the same power as the Demon King.
 
The severe acts carried out by her during her lifetime, represented by the burning of Mt. Hiei, transformed into a Noble Phantasm.
Due to the misconceptions piled on her by the populace after her death - like mistaken visual representations, wild stories and game knowledge -, she materialized as a Demon Lord of the Sixth Heaven-like existence and boasts a considerable advantage against enemies possessing divinity; however, this is a double-edged sword that is difficult to handle since it could burn even her to ashes eventually.
Since her original Demon Lord of the Sixth Heaven state is a dangerous mode that would turn not only the gods and Buddha but even her to ashes, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven state is being limited by sealing it into the class known as Berserker.
Although she plays it off with her foolish speech and actions, this form is a fairly dangerous state for Nobunaga to be in, so she has to cool down by periodically releasing (shout) mana (rock).
In the case of a Heroic Spirit with little to no divinity, it would be just a somewhat noisy Noble Phantasm.
“Nobunaga THE Rock ’n’ Ro\~\~\~\~\~\~ll!! YAY!!”
