### Magical Resistance: C

Nullifies spells that have a chant of two verses or below. Cannot defend against something large-scale like Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.

### Riding: A+

One can freely handle all beasts and vehicles except the Dragon Species.
Her being able to ride is because of the deity Gozu Tennou.

### Madness Enhancement: C

A Skill that strengthens one’s physical abilities in exchange for their sense of reason.
Although that mentality is still broken to some extent even though she got into the Lancer Class, there is a big difference when compared to the time she was a Berserker. That is, the presence of a sense of morals. With her moral sense, Lancer Minamoto no Raikou looks out for disorders in the public morals of the summer holidays. But as she is relatively indifferent to her very own appearance for instance, the signs of a broken mind still cannot be completely erased from her…

### Divinity: C

Raikou was born as the heaven-sent child of Gozu Tennou so she possesses the Divinity Skill.
