### Mental Pollution: B

The person in question has personally stated that she does not have this Skill, but it in fact remains with her.

### The Shadow Public Morals Committee’s Chairwoman: A

An altered Skill of Eternal Martial Arts Mastery.
No matter what kind of situation it is, she will not overlook a disorder of public morals. Even if she lost her sailor uniform…

### Wrought Iron Wheelbarrow: C

“When one speaks of sailor uniforms, it has to be this” – such is Kintoki’s subjective impression which ended up infecting Raikou. Raikou, who embodies every single martial art, perfectly handles a wrought iron yo-yo, using it to drive away every single summer temptation that tries to corrupt Chaldea’s public morals.

### Summer Catastrophe: EX

It is already amazing even without taking them off————but it becomes even more amazing when she takes them off.
A Skill falsely similar to Summer Crisis{{n1}}, demonstrating how many looks one ends up gathering from other people at the beach. Unlike Beach Flower, it even focuses onto oneself gazes that deviate from the sphere of affectionate yearning.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Should have been Beach Crisis instead of Summer Crisis.
