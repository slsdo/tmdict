### Personality

In order to enforce public morals, Raikou changed into the Shadow Public Morals Committee’s Chairwoman. Her catchphrase is “Prohibited, prohibited, absolutely prohibited!” She has become much more serious than usual. She has no interest in the outcome of the race that Ishtar is holding, and she is purely intending to monitor the participants that appears to be waiting for an opportunity provided by the summer event to act without too much restraint.

Eventually, Raikou’s spirits will rise and she will end up throwing her sailor uniform off, causing a situation where she will be the one who is completely corrupting public morals the most without meaning to… and yet to the person herself, she really has no self-awareness. Or, does she…?

### Attitude towards Master

Towards the Master, Raikou comes into contact with them persistently with committee chairwoman moves such as “Listen, you must not be too immersed in liberal thoughts just because it is summer, am I clear?”
“But, um, President, it’s in sight… That, er… That slit in your skirt is very bold of you… More than anything, that’s quite the terrific swimsuit underneath your sailor uniform…”
“? What happened?”
“As expected, she really is unaware!”

### Dialogue Examples

“Lancer, Minamoto no Raikou. I am the Shadow Public Morals Committee’s Chairwoman who protects Chaldea’s public morals. There is already relief here now that I came, Master. I will by no means overlook any wicked deed!”
“The Public Morals Committee is power. Power itself is the Public Morals Committee. You comprehend, right?”
“Do you understand? You understand, right? You must not corrupt the public morals!”
“To those who corrupt the public morals! You will be purged!”
“Prohibited, prohibited, absolutely prohibited!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Raikou began to pay an undue amount of attention to public morals. The very same person as Berserker Raikou.

Last time during summer, Raikou heard of a considerable disorder of public morals that happened on the Southern Island. “This year’s event must not become a situation of that sort again” – she personally gave such a prayer to Gozu Tennou and forced a Class Change on herself. Even if it is not to the extent of the case when she is a Saber, which is her rightful Class, she at least achieved a transformation into Lancer Minamoto no Raikou in which her maternal power was moderated and her disposition in protecting the capital was strengthened.

“Yo, Raikou-san will become unbelievably serious as a Saber when it consists of her main job. A Public Morals Committee’s Super Chairwoman.”
“If it’s Lancer… I know, I can describe the position as a ‘Shadow Public Morals Committee’s Chairwoman’, yeah? You might say, in other words————”

In other words, a leader of a female gang.
While her maternal power is still moderated, Raikou, as the gallant warrior that protects the capital, cuts through the summer!

### Connections with Characters

#### Xuanzang Sanzang

Raikou, who concluded with “They are making the summer event festive”, “That is proof” and “They already changed into swimsuits in Chaldea”, declares to Sanzang, “If you want to be rehabilitated, come along with me, and that will undoubtedly conform to the great intentions of the Honourable Buddha as well, do you not agree?”
Sanzang, who cannot help but feel the divine protection of the gods from Raikou, turned out to be in very high spirits, saying “This isn’t particularly a swimsuit, but interesting! I wanna see what you’ll do!” and entered into the race together with Raikou.

#### Swimsuit Servants / Kiara / Medb

“Prohibited, because those are too shameless!”

#### Boudica

“Your provocative attire is very much prohibited. I had been thinking of such since long ago.”

#### Scheherazade

“Needless to say, prohibited, prohibited, absolutely prohibited!”

#### Nitocris (Swimsuit)

“It is OK if it is only your Saint Graph’s first stage.”

#### Fran (Swimsuit)

“It is OK during the race.” (Because Fran shows little exposure at the time of running the race, it is OK to Raikou.)
But given that it is a swimsuit attire if she is outside of the race, Raikou’s response becomes “Not good. Leaving too many gaps is not good of you, so properly cover up the spots that should be hidden!”

#### Shuten-douji

An oni who is the same as the source that corrupts public morals. “Hey, your existence is prohibited!”

#### Oni Servants

“Oni and the like are the embodiment of the disorder of public morals.”

#### Arthur

“A gentleman suitable for the Shadow Public Morals Committee.”

#### Sakata Kintoki (Berserker)

“I am worried. Given that I am now the Shadow Public Morals Committee’s Chairwoman, the number of times I conduct myself as a mother just like usual has decreased. Please, I hope you do not do things such as turning yourself to delinquency.”

#### Sakata Kintoki (Rider)

“That hairstyle… did you become a delinquent by some chance!?”
