When I received a request for Miss Swimsuit Raikou, I wondered if it was okay? “Okay, I’m worried, because even notwithstanding that BODY under normal circumstances, it’ll become a serious matter if I undress her!! I don’t know if I should continue anymore!” Then, when I was having fun drawing her freely, it resulted in a finish like this. The highlight of the design is Sukeban{{n1}} Raikou from its second stage since I wanted to do a costume that has impact, but I wonder if I somewhat overdid it by having decided on a considerably aggressive choice? And, when I was nervously trying to propose her character sheet, I unexpectedly received the OK, and I was elated; I got them to grant all sorts of selfish requests of mine such as the yo-yo attacks and the submarine pitch for her Noble Phantasm direction, and there was nothing but gratitude from me! Thank you very much, truly!! (Honjou Raita)
