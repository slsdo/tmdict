The Diamond Pounder of Gozu Tennou – also known as the Oriental Deity Taishakuten (Indra) – namely, a Vajra – the ultimate weapon of the gods made from sacred sacral bones – comes down from the skies and annihilates all the enemies————Because of this Noble Phantasm, Raikou’s Class ultimately gets to be established as Lancer at this occasion. Its shape is that of a tokkosho{{n1}}, which is said to represent the single Tathātā, the substance of all things in creation as taught in the Vajrayana.

Arjuna: “That Noble Phantasm is father’s…”
Rama: “That Noble Phantasm is…”
