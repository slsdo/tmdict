Trishula Shakti.
The limit release of the trisula, the three-pronged spear that Parvati borrowed from Shiva.
By means of the weapon that Shiva had bestowed unto her, Parvatiâ€™s class was determined.
Due to the trisula, Parvati acquired the qualifications as a Lancer.
Naturally, it is not possible to demonstrate the true value of this weapon as much as Shiva; instead, it provides assistance in protecting her framework as a Servant.
