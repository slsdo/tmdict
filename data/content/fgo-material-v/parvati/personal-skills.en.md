### Imaginary Around: EX

The magic trait of the vessel girl, developed even more.

### Ashes of Kama: EX

Parvati is a calm goddess, weak at fighting.
However, it does not mean that her heart too, is weak.
Her heart that think of the one she loves is stronger and its depth deeper than any manner of god.
If it is for the sake of those she loves, even if she should break her body or burn away her divinity, she will muster the strength to fight.
Even if it is only a blaze for a brief moment, she is comparable to the goddess of destruction Kali, one of Shiva’s wife.
Worthy of mention is the fact that it has nothing to do with how what Shiva feels towards her.
Parvati holds the special characteristic of being able to foster her love towards someone, even if said person seems to ignore her.
It is a wholehearted love but, it’s a bit… no, legendary level of heavy.
Moreover, Kama holds the meaning of love, but it also is the name of the god of love that Shiva burned to death. During his ascetic practice, Shiva had been ceaselessly ignoring Parvati, who had been sent to become Shiva’s wive.
The exasperated gods then had sent Kama, disturbing Shiva’s meditation using Kama’s arrow, so that he would notice Parvati.

### Blessing of the Goddess: A+

A gift from the (good) goddess.
It comes from the episode when she hit her own head and gave her blood to her servant who was unable to bear thirst and starvation.
