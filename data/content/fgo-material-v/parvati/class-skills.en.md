### Magic Resistance: A

Cancels all A rank magic and below. As a matter of fact, modern magi are incapable of hurting Parvati.

### Goddess’ Divine Core: B

A Skill representing one’s status as a goddess perfected since birth.
Has the effect of preserving the absoluteness of mind and body. Repels most mental interference, halts body growth, and no matter how much calorie she consumed, her figure does not change.
Due to her being a pseudo-Servant, the rank stopped at B.
But who cares about that anyway.
Her figure! Does not! Change!
